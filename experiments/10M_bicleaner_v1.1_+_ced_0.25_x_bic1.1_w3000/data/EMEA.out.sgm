<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Library Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP), described in detail in order to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your disease or their treatment, please read the package line (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirless thinking and talking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar disorder, a psychic illness, in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal noise) alternates with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of medium to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural troubles if the oral ingestion of medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases the solution can be used to capture or the melting tablets in patients who prepares the swallowing of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be adapted to the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "it is thought to be" "" "partial agony" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitter, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means Aripibenzene like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but less than the neurotransmitter has to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder plays a role to normalize the activity of the brain, thus avoiding psychotic or manic symptoms and it will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the symptoms occur in three studies, up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection-solution was compared to two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperize, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which were to prevent re-occur in 160 patients, where the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection-solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, with which compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to determine (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with injection-solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction of symptoms are increased unrest than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was beneficial in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented one of 74 weeks working in more effective than placebo in case of treated manic episodes with previously treated patients and when it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache (tremor), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), loss hyperactivity (increased storage), fatigue, fatigue (loss of saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) arrived at the end that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-severe to severe incidents in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which manic episodes on the treatment with Aripizole asked to transfer risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee on the result came that the advantages of injection practices in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., a approval to the public transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is responsible for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day even daily with meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not demonstrated, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapies or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">ABILIFY's efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to greater sensitivity of these patients (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction can be removed from combination therapy, the arithmezole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the onset of a antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripigezole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemic of epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder did not have increased suicidal risk with anbenzene in comparison to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripibezole should be treated with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, hyperconductive disorders), cerebral vascular diseases, conditions that predisputes for hypotonia (dehydration, treatment with blood pressure-related medicines) or hypertonia (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazole dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the symptoms of an ABILIFY treated patients with signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis should be dragged to reduce the dose or interrupt the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient is developing signs and symptoms that indicate a mns or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be reset.</seg>
<seg id="41">Aripizole should therefore be applied to patients with seizures in the anamnese or at surfactions, which are related to the seizure of seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripizole in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with the Alzheimer's disease, an elevated risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however, in one of these studies, a study with fixer dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to unwanted cerebrovascular events treated with Aripizole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly be monitored regularly regarding the worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain as side effect is known, and may lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Based on the primary effects of Aripizole to the central nervous system, caution is provided when Aripizole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centralised drugs with recurring side effects like seaweed (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the rate of arithmezole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased its AUC by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3s can result in higher plasma imaging to CYP2D6 extendized metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential health benefits should overweigh the potential risks of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Imitconazole and HIV protein, might have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">The diltiazem or Escalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripigezole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methodological morphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if she become pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data to safety during humans and due to the concerns in reproductive trials, this medicinal product may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against it, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, to service, until they are certain that Aripigezole did not have a negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following effects occurred more common (≥ 1 / 100) than on placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the aforementioned side effects are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, acathisie, dystonia and dyskinosa were compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripigezole treatment and 13,1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripigezole and 15.1% in patients under oslanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% was suffering from patients under teriprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semi-idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS decreased to 26.6% in patients under Aripigezole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripigezol- treatment and 15.7% were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripizole and placebo which were potentially clinically controlled changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medical significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripizole patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects associated with an antipsychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesis and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality rates in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute hyperdosizations were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and observed without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripigezole; however, it is unlikely that haticalysis in the treatment is a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of arithmezole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial diagonal effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and a diagonal effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripizole showed a high affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and an inserotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT7- and 5HT7-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenal and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With a gift of Aripizole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day more than 2 weeks on healthy subjects showed a dosing-dependant reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, an D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus cautius and at Putting.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripizole found a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week 52 the proportion of patients who were enrolled in a semi-randomized study included a response to study medication related to both groups (Aripizole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring scales defined as secondary courses, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg - Depresant Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study conducted more than 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in the return rate, which was 34% in the Aripizole group and 57% of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an oslanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, 314 patients included in significantly less patients with a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with a flexible dose over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripigezole displayed a placebo-superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monootherapy study more than 3 weeks with a fibrosis of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder Aripibezole found no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapies more than 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or semi-opidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the week Aripizole also proved a comparable proportion of people with symptomatic remission of the manie on such as Lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which do not part in lithium or Valproat monotherapy, yielding a superior efficacy comparable to the reduction of monozole compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase of more than 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripigeole compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly on prevention of a bipolar return.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies, enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyzole and the N-deadline is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripigezole with extensive metabolites over CYP2D6 and with approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor," metabolism of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripigeole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study did not have sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popal-specific evaluation on pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences in respect of ethnicity or the effect of smoking at the pharmacokinetics of Aripigeole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Ariium-benzene and Dehydro-Aripigeole were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study involving subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of the pharmacokinetic and dehydration of the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which does not suffice to draw shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity, and toxicity, genotoxicity, and canogeneous potential, the clinical data had no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which have exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of people, so they only have a limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects rerecorded a dosisdependant side ringement and / or parenchyma cell exposure (AUC) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the recommended maximum dose while humans) and an increase of minor symptoms of 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the medium Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose when people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelixiasis developed as a result of the colonization of sulphate conjuites from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81ple of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripigeole did not know more than 6% of the concentrations that were found in the study of over 39 weeks in the Gall of Monkeys, and lie well below the limits (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical level dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antibacterial inhibitor that stimulates the microtubules of the tubes of microtubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting of its depolysis.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a hibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubulular Network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cellular functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates the transgenosis of plasma components in the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of Albumin promotes the transportation of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transeness transport through the gp-60-Albuminrereceptor will be mediated and given a paclitaxel accumulation in cysteine in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two randomised controlled studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abraxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane was compared with the values after a 3 hour injections of 175 mg / m2 of solvent paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance by paclitaxel was higher according to the Abraxane-gift (43%) than after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue coating is reported that paclitaxel is first formed in the first line to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and too two smaller Metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value of cumulative carcinogens was 4% of the total full dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates an extensive non-renal Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anuesysymptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease load; therefore assessing the individual clinical assessment and disease prevention is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobins increased by more than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Because of the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in patients with individual hemoglobbinations above or using the hemoglobbin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobbariability it should be tried by a corresponding dose management, the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dL (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / d( 7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobbination value increases by more than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the long-term hemoglobbinbiner is 12 g / dL (7.5 mmol / l), the epicine alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored engmeshy to ensure that epoxettin alfa is in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anuesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dL or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may possibly require higher maintenance doses for patients with which the initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dL or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results indicate that patients with initially low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may possibly require higher maintenance doses (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemogloba value at least 1 g / dL (0.62 mmol / l) or the recurring number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl from the initial value, the dose should be maintained from 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobbination &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the recurring number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 i.e. / kg three times a week.</seg>

<seg id="401">If the hemoglobbinbination around &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the recurring number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoxy-alfa therapy is unlikely to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with slight anemia (haemokrit 33 - 39%), in which the pre-stooping storage of ≥ 4 blood coils is necessary should receive seamed at a dose of 600 i.e. / kg of bodyweight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the onset of the autologous blood spinning programs - will be available at the beginning of the abulamed treatment of large iron reserves.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 HP / kg epetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>

<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have not shown a significant benefit that is due to the gift of epoxetins, if the hemoglobbination is increased via the concentration of anathering symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions required.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dL (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d( 1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinical evidence-resistant coronary artery disease or dissolving insufficiency should not be exceeded in accordance with Section 4.2, the maximum limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to present, the treatment of anemia with epoxetine alfa is insufficiency with renal insufficiency with kidney failure, which are not accelerated the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour-patient with chemotherapy, epoxettin alfa should be considered a 2 - 3-week delay between epoxettin-alfa-gift and erythropotin response (patients who may be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dL (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dL (8,1 mmol / l) must be adjusted to minimize the risk of possible thrombal events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapianemia - Dosisadaptation with the goal to keep the hemoglobbinge between 10 g / dL and 12 g / dL).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit of risk provisioning in particular patients who should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>

<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon-RFT study were randomized, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures amounted to 7.5% in aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of aclasta was once referred to the percentage of weekly gift of Alendronat in comparison to the percentage of the Lendenvertebra-BMD within 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the Knoist Aclasta was investigated in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with the radiologically clear Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6fold to 3.0x age-specific upper standard value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedronat once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">After 6 months of combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain relief was observed compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified by the end of the six month main study as Responsive (on the therapy) could be recorded in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with aclasta and 107 with risedronate patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was compared with 71 of the patients treated with the risk of fractures, in the middle period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiples 5 and 15 minutes persevered infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which has proved dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma level decreased rapidly from &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0,1% of the value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast biphoric vanishing from the large circulation system with half hours of ½ α 0,24 and t ½ x 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminale Eliminationshalsweremade to ½ g of 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the excretions on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The full body-Clearance is irrespective of the dose of 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race, or bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in the ciliary concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma centration of time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because Zoledronic is not metabolized - and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This emerges that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function up to 35 ml / min does not require dosing adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">For severe kidney function (creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), only restricted dates are possible, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute Toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous dose was 10 mg / kg of bodyweight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">Studies in dogs have single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the recommended number of human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal modulation.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zinc deficiency in 3-day intervals, totaling 6 times (a cumulative dose containing about the 6fold of the human therapeutic exposure (equivalent to 7500 mg / kg) administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose representing the 7fold of the human therapeutic exposure, relative to AUC, corresponds to), well tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Library Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP), described in detail in order to proceed to recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It cannot be applied solely (monotherapies) in patients (especially overweight patients), where metformin (a drug-medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory in the highest possible dose alone in the highest possible dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl harnmaterial or insulin it can maintain the previous dose of sulfonyl species (low blood sugar) in the beginning, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfondness and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be enhanced and the blood sugar level decreases, which means that type 2 diabetes is better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl species, in addition, they received up to 3.5 years either with either account or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycemylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value to conclude that blood glucose levels were reduced from 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the addition of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl was revealed in a lowering of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin had been examined in 289 patients, the patients who received Actos in addition to insulin measures yielding a lowering of the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, infections of upper respiratory tract infections (cold), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who are probably excessive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketonlevels - infant levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos would serve as part of a monootherapy (in sole use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, Metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to join Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and inappropriate for contraindications of contraindications (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of Pioglitazone in patients under 18 years, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. past heart infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease) are endangered, a decompoised heart failure should begin to begin the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone in combination with insulin is used.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study involving Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in relation to heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror is increased to 3 times the normal range of the normal range, the liver enzymic values are as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient is developing symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, thophthalate, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark Harn, are to check the liver enzymic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazone should be continued until the end of the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, dosisdependant weight gain was detected, which can stir from fatty deposits and connected in some cases with a liquid equation.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobbazone decreased slightly (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies involving Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematology (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who received Pioglitazon as oral dual-combination therapy or triple combination therapy with insulin-combination therapy or as a two-way combination therapy, the risk of dosisdependant hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, the treatment with Thiazolidindigenes, including Pioglitazone, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the taking of Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but miserable doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients are reported about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmic declaration should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of messages undesirable events concerning bone-brooches from randomised, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with the Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) which were treated with pioglitazone patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient desire a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment is decreasing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of the interaction have shown that Pioglitazone do not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamic of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions of medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptiva, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reduction inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inspector) resulted in a lowering of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the Turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-ascents occurred over three times the standard range from the norm range frequently to placebo, but more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulphurous liquid.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of a severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazone or less.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely about cardiac insufficiency was reported under Pioglitazon, more frequently when Pioglitazone in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure was applied in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It was a summarizing analysis of undesired events regarding broken pieces of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with spoglitazone groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the PROACTIVE study, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, 180 mg / day after seven days had no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activating specific core receptors (PPAR-g)), which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazone versus Gliclaze as a monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the period up to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">After two years after the beginning of the treatment, blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclaicide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three-month optimisation phase with insulin insufficient, too pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to patients who continued to only received insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in which was treated with Pioglitazone group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year there was a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine quotas compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was evaluated in a small, 18-week investigation on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel, as well as minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the overall plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to Plazebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected, whereas the values were observed under metformin and Gliclacidal values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the post-dendial triglyceride level, this is also an effect on triglyceride absorption than also on the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease were randomized in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years, in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is reabsorbed quickly, with top concentrations of the unaltered Pioglitazone in plasma, usually 2 hours after application will be reached.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, M-IV's contribution to the effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interaction studies, Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamic of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with the fibrosis (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 Inspector) or reduces the plasma centration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marketers Pioglitazon in humans, markers became mainly found in fences (55%) and found at a lower extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of the unchangeable pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours and the total active metabolites is 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasmodifying concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with restricted kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance is similar to the breast.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and apes, after repeated administration of plasma enlargement with hematlution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the treatment with Pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for the fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), the rat-increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urea epithelium induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family-friendly polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazolidindices led to an elevated frequency of colontumres.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years with the Pioglitazone treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years for women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) which were treated with pioglitazone patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with Pioglitazone or Gliclaicide have been studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone, there was a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinine quotas compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the sober triglycerides, but also improved the post-dendial triglyceride level, this is both above a effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic trygtierid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortality, non-deadly coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the Knuckle, Coronarer Revascularisation and Revascularisation of the leg arteries, submit the results close that the taking of Pioglitazon are not associated with cardiovascular memory.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and wear on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of messages undesirable events concerning bone-brooches from randomised, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients who received comparative medication, showed an increased incidence of fracture in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) which were treated with pioglitazone patients compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="1404">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplant was kicked off after a year (by example, examined how often a renewed organ transplant or a recovery of the dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were performed and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immune disease therapy and the treatment of transplant patients, this drug should be ordered or changes in the immune disease.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft reactions or to an elevated incidence of side effects, including sub- or autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; revisions of formulation or regimes should only be done under tight control of one in the transplantation experienced physician (see section 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptions must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based on the clinical assessment of repulence and tolerability in the individual case and based on blood-level regulations (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus levels should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">At Day 4, the systemic exposure was measured as a level mirror, both with both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended throughout the first two weeks after grafts using Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate effect phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a substance with low Clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from prograf at Advagraf needs to be converted into a daily intake of prograf capsules on a once daily intake of Advagraf, this changeover has to take place at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After a conversion of other immunossuppressy to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with each one in kidney and liver transplant must begin recommended initiation for the prophylaxis of graft reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant For adult patients who are turned on Advagraf is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant receivers, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf, pancreas and darmented patients, occurred at an oral initiation dose of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initiation dose of 0.10 mg / kg / day and in an oral test dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for use.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptions in special patient groups Patients with restricted liver function on maintaining blood tales in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no effect on the pharmaceutical inetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adaption is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of renal function (including a regular determination of serenciratininspiegel, calculation of the creatinine and monitoring body volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin on Advagraf with the changeover of a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is careful (see section 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the Talmud levels in full-blood The dose should be based on clinical assessment of repulence and tolerability in the individual case under activation of full-blood tacrolimus levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow-levels of Tacrolimus should also be checked after switching by Prograf on Advagraf, Dosisadaptation, changes to immunoglobster therapy or with simultaneous use of substances which could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations can require several days, until the Steady State entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make sure that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level levels will not be exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tacular mirror of Tacrolimus usually lie in the first time following liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and mashed patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft reactions or other side effects, which can occur in a consequence of tacrolimus sub- or excessive exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; revisions of formulation or regimes should only be done under tight control of one in the transplantation experienced physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft reactions, which has been proven to other immunosynressources, are not yet clinical data for the retardant formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of graft reactions in adult cardiac transplants and graft recipients are still no clinical data for the retardant formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a lowering of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements may include, or other plant extracts during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is provided, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to severe fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, as a program as kardiomyopathy, chamber or septic hypertrophie denominated, which can therefore also be found under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid exposure and oils.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosressiva, exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to suitable clothing or use of sun protection by suitable clothing or using a solar protection factor with a high degree of protection.</seg>

<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacological effects on molecular level should be mediated the effects of tacrolimus by its binding to cytosolish protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibiting of signal transmission for T-cell and prevents the transcription of a certain type of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells, further the formation of lymphokinen (like interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and g -interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor cells.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 pieces of transplanting patients, 475 patients underwent a pancreas transplantation, and in 630 cases were used as a primary immunoglobite in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oralem watches in these published studies showed the observations in the big studies where Prograf is applied for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lunging transplantation In a preliminary analysis of a recent programme conducted via a recent programme was reported about 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosin as part of a 1: 1-Randomanization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic transplantation, bronchiolitis was obliterative syndrome, was observed in the first year after the transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year amounted to 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus patients increased in 21.7% of cases to the emergence of a bronchiolitis in comparison to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosis had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were accompanied by tacrolimus to Ciclosine (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there was no acute graft reactions occurred after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) for the transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group greater (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis was obliterated - syndroms treated with tacrolimus patients significantly lower.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocate value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unborn faction of Tacrolimus, or by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates for transplantation after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This allows to conclude that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized by the excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly made via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients receiving programme (once daily) at Advagraf (once daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), the systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was less than 10% lower than under programme.</seg>

<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of the application are addressed afterwards, if Advate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method, referred to as "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was emptied to the formation of the human faculty factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a drug approved by others in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is otherwise made that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the medicine was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new hemorchards were honoured with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) against the human clots factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission approved the company Baxter AG a approval for the public transport of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of the substituent therapy act after the severity of the factor VIII-Mangel, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma levels (in% of the norm, or in i.e., / dL).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During treatment, a reasonable dose and frequency of injections becomes an adequate provision of the factor VIII-plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different semesters.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities are not achieved, or if the bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to verify inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values it is possible that the VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The intake rate should be set after the patient's desire, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complications of patients suffering from haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposition days is the biggest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 Expositions and anamnestic-known inhibitors, according to switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product, was observed in a different recombination of (lowest) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The incidence of ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who were all previously untreated patients who have increased risk of education of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the basis of the first approvals, the CHMP has continued the benefit-risk management as a positive rating, but consider that the safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore the CHMP has on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal process in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) that the company has resigned his request for permission to take from Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the soft parts (tissue, which links other structures in the body, covers and backs).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified, that a gene can carry into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been altered so that there is no copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger in man.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from non-defectives in the human body of the p53 gene, usually contributes to recovery damage DNA and kill the cells, when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">By Li-Fraumeni-cancer, the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein works no right, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the field of substructure, in bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the answers of the company on the questions, some questions were still unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the initial documentation, the CHMP is created on Day 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee further concerns concerns concerning the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advantin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in in contact with the patient, harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP to know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently interested in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advocin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered drug-release" "" "means that the tablets are so conformed that one of the effective components immediately and the other is slowly released for a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, nasal inflammation of the nasal infections) in patients with nasal skin slipping (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as brief as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal nerve (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the medication can be refusing to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main feasibility measurements were the changes of the severity of the hay fever symptoms, which were reported from patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In viewing of all hay fever symptoms, including constipation of the nose, the patients receiving the symptoms reported by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nose was considered, the patients under Aerinaze had a reduction of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to the patients who are desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykarate (cardiac activity), oral drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleepiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) to Desloratadine, Pseudoedrin or one of the other components against adrenal active ingredients or Loratadine (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (high blood pressure), blood or vascular diseases including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroiosis (hyperthyself) or already a hemorrhagic stroke (caused by a cerebral blood stroke) or have a risk for a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted a approval to the SP Europe company approval for the public transport of Aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, to swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to disassemble or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data to unthinkable and effectiveness (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after losing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as at long-term application the activity of Pseudoedrin can take hold of time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After passing the swelling of the mucous membranes into the upper breathing, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoedrine contains, the medicine is also counter-indicated in patients who treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after ending this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity with other vasoconstrikine such as Bromocripiitin, Pergoid, Lisbonid, Cabergolin, Dihydroergotamine or other deonstruction, phenylephrine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, hydrohazolin, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of these combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data are not enough to enroll the recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have been tested in patients with kidney or liver function disorder and do not submit the data to enroll the recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment in occurrence of hypertonia or tachycaror, or corruptions, heart rhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or reinforcement of the headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">The treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful: • Patients with heart rhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, brass knapconstruction or bronchospasmus in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing the matological tests, since antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or can reduce in their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma centration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests there were no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadine and those who were treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs could not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadinhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicinal CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unquestionable of the application of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, yet experience from a large number of affected pregnancies caused no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproductive studies on animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstrikic properties of Pseudoedrin, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to any impairment of the transportation, or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular-circulation) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, treading, convulsions) with possible letree.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, severe mistress, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tensions, Euphrates, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythmias, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, corrosive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">An CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children as well as atrophin-typical symptoms (mouth-drying, pupil rigid and dilatation, hood, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the hibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturbcells / bases as well as the inhibition of expression of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selnitine on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In one single dose trial with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplification subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg. daily has no increased incidence of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further likomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachometer or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">In total, 1,248 patients participated in the age between 12 and 78 years of seasonal rhinitis. 414 patients with Aerinaze tablets were received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined using the total score for the symptoms (except nose syndrome swellung), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in regard to the wellbeing effect, determined based on the nasal skin slipping, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in regards to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of one single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is present within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers above 14 days the flow-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoedrin was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-automotive study, which was performed with formulation of healthy adult subjects, found that four subjects desloratadine was badly affected.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A Component Interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of Pseudoedrine resulting from the sole gift of pseudoedrine was the exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, for toxicity in remanufacturing, to gene otoxicity, and to reproductive oxicity, the pre-clinical data with Desloratadin don't recognise any special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the adverse effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-related studies, the combination of Loratadine / Pseudoedrine was not implied with a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials with seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of paddling, impairment of sleep and performance in days) and after six weeks of treatment was obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to use and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius were considered an average decrease of symptom onset (symptoms point) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urtikaria the decline of symptoms after six weeks treatment was 58 and 67% compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) to Desloratadine, Loratadine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted a approval to the company SP Europe issued a approval for the public transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of desloratadine in adolescents aged from 12 to 17 years (see section 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done in accordance with the previous disease, and can be resumed after the end of the symptoms and re-occur.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended throughout the patient period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically important interactions were not found in the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were given in addition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 is not enhanced when taking Aerius and alcohol consumed the effective effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be clarified, however, that in very rare cases it may occur in very rare cases that can lead to any impairment of the transportation, or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently recorded side effects, which was reported more often than in placebo was drowsiness (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side-effect headache, which occurred at 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose study, up to 45 mg of desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the hibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human masturbcells / bases as well as the inhibition of expression of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study involving multiple outlets that was administered in the desloratadine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in the Desloratadine, in a dose of 45 mg daily (the ninth of clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual dosing study, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplification subjective drowsiness or the tasks that are associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis was Aerius effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacrists and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and persistent, allergic rhinitis can also be classified in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall score of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces that caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigating for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology considers the underlying pathology in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine-release is an estimated factor in all ancient diseases, Desloratadine is also expected in other forms of urticaria to improve symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidance.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria was Aerius effective in improving pruritus and lowering the size and number of quaddles at the end of the first dose intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the Jewish population by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, which were comparable in patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, in 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadine was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no measurement points for clinically relevant Kumulation after a daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzyme has not yet been identified, so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadinhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicinal CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosing study with Desloratadine in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty foods, calorie rich breakfast) does not depend on the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical studies carried out with desloratadine and Loratadine were performed on a comparable degree from the exposure of desloratadine, not qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of toxicity profile of Desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on security spharmacology, toxicity in reproductxizity, pre-clinical data with Desloratadine has no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (includes lactose-Monohydrat, Hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (includes Hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of the meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is present to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper breathing lessons or anatomic anomalies should play a role in the diagnosis, physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years of metabolic desloratadine are limited and experienced a higher yield point (see under Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children aged between 2 and 11 years, which is restricted by metabolic, is identical to children who are normally metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflyov should be used in adults and older men to protect flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influenza virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out if a new strain of influenza virus emerges, which can be easily spread from human beings, because humans still have no immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on membrane surface, which detects the human body as body-foreign), was cleansed, purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">This allows the scope of clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine, in order to comply with the requirements of the EMEA region vaccines requirements.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution to the use, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the security of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenera should then be prescribed when the doctor tested, which antiviral drugs of the patient had previously taken, and the likelihood has indicated that the virus is approached on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and other antiviral drugs.</seg>

<seg id="1911">Agenera was investigated in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without kinsavir, studied in two basic studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with Proteasehemiah.</seg>
<seg id="1912">In 206 adults, with low dogsted ritual increased medicinal products, had been compared with other protewear inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken a proteinhibitor, after 48 weeks under Agenerously, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than to placebo, but Agenera was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenera also reduced the virusload, but with the children who had been treated with Proteasehemiah, very few were said in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, who had previously been treated with Proteasehemiah, the viral load increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteasehemmer:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protewear inhibitors, there came under Agenera to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their existing protruin inhibitor:</seg>

""</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier ponavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agenera in combination with kinsavir in patients who have previously not taken proteasehemmer, is not demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenera was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances," since the approval of scientific reasons only posted limited information.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to approval for the public transport of Agenera across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Ageneralized is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Proteasehemmer (PI), treated adults and children from 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Alevase capsules are supposed to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosting with low doses of kinsavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ambabor should take place in consideration of the individual viral load type and pre-treatment of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ambabor as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Ambabor as capsule; therefore, Agenera capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram base (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended adult dose is 600 mg of Ambabor twice a day together with 100 mg kinsavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Alevase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kinsavir (booster), higher doses of chorus (1200 mg twice a day) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Aprase capsules is 20mg of Ambabor / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambabor that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of aserase in combination with low doses of kinsavir or other proteasehemors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenera is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to failure of data to unthinkable and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Aprase capsules in adult patients with middle-heaviest liver function has to be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder with caution carried out in patients with severe liver function disorder is contra-indicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenera must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width, and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ambabor during the taking of Ambabor (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with agenera, does not prevent risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Aprase capsules are supposed to be used together with low doses of kinsavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver cancelling with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show a higher frequency of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice.</seg>

<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin depends heavily by CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of agastatin with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopolysis including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects like Carbamazepin, phenytoin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective for decreased plasma levels (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Based on the possibility of metabolic drug interactions with Ambabor, the effectiveness of hormonal contraeptiva can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to estimate the kind of interaction.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Ambabor, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiracy symptoms, especially if there are still low doses taken from Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity of a toxicity of the Agenera solution, this intestine form is contra-indicated for children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenera should be set to about 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy, including proteasehemmer, has been reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an external type of diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of aisase must not be given at the same time using medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude, and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic latitude of aiscr must not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly exchanged via CYP2D6 and combined with increased plasma concentration with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Ambabor that can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In an attempt to compensate the lower plasma concentration by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very frequently desired effects on the liver have been observed.</seg>

<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taken in the curry, the amotaval mirror, and, if possible, examine the virusload and add the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adaptable for one of the drugs is not necessary, when Nelfinavir is administered along with Ambabor (see also Eames below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax by 30% lower if Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) administered in combination with Ambabor capsules (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of Ambabor were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, which prove the effectiveness and unquestionable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ambabor (750 mg twice a day) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ambabor in plasma, which were obtained at the combination of Ambabor (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambabor (600 mg twice a day) in combination with 100 mg kinsavir is administered twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra can not be given, but there will be a close-meshed monitoring, because the effectiveness and inconvenience of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didano in combination with didano in combination, however, due to the antacid component of didano, is recommended that revenues of didanosin and agenerously lie down at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with an eardrop in combination with Ambabor (600 mg twice a day) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Estenirenz in combination with Ambabor and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protein-inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteasehemmer and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may decrease the serum concentration of Amotavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this drug should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced / possibly subtherapeutic plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If this drug is used together, caution is necessary; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance is to be done as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Ambabor and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous interpreting of Ambabor and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma centration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus resulted in an increase in the side effects associated with Ridustin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required along with aisase, at least half of the recommended dose is advised, although no clinical data is required.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with bladder in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma concentration of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg / ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma to 25% and AUC (0-5m) to 2,69times compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosampbabor with kinsavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can result in common with Agenerously, possibly causing interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be connected to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with chorus.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasehemmer, it is advisable that Antazida not be taken at the same time as aisase since it can come to resoratory disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-convulva that are known as enzyme oils (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Ambabor, can lead to a disadvantage of the plasma concentration of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nidpin, nidpin, nimodipine, nidpin and verapamil can be increased as 10 by Ambabor, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption of chorus may increase the plasma levels considerably and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg of Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) increased significantly during 7 days. endogenous cortisol increased by around 86% (90% account interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, together with this glucoherald together with these glucocoids, it is not recommended that the possible benefit of treating a risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, is pronounced as the result of the plasma concentration of agglomerates.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Da Plasmaspids increases the HMG-CoA-Reduction-inhibitors to myopathy, including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this drug with Ambabor is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended for common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations as up to stabilization of mirror, because the plasma centrations of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased when it can be increased from Ambabor (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenera must not be used together with oral cordazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time application of agenera is provided with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data regarding the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protein extracts indicate a possible rise in plasma concentration of Midazolam about 3-4 torrent.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Ambabor, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiracy symptoms, especially if there are still low doses taken from Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the lower low reliability of historical publishers, no recommendation can currently be given, such as the Ambavr dose is administered when it is given to methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the same grace of warfarin or other oral anticoagulant together with agenera, increased control of the INR (International standardization ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weaken or reinforcement of antithrombal effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraeptiva is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (such as Desipramin and Nortryptilin) is recommended for simultaneous interpretations of Agenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be applied for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus in comparison to the possible risks.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactation rats, Ambabor related substances were detected, however, it is not known whether Ambabor leaves in people into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats which was given by the elimination in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight in the postage.</seg>

<seg id="2003">In adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials were studied in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the hernia-associated side effects were mild to moderate, very early, and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified whether it is used in connection with the pill or any other at the same time to the HIV treatment applied drugs, or whether it is a sequence of the marathering.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), which were not treated twice daily with Proteasehemently.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), listed below the study medicine as part of the study medication and were performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well under the treatment of management changes (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fast liposal fat tissue, hypertrophie of the breasts and dorsovivial fat accumulation (Stierooks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Of 113 antiretroviral individuals who were treated with hamivudin / Zidovudin in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a median duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Stilt) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>

<seg id="2015">In the case of overdose the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures can be led.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ambabor binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viruses of viral gag- and gag-pol- Polyproteins in a consequence of formation, non-infectious viral infection.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymphocytomatic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Ambabor is in the area of 0.012 to 0,08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,41 µm at chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ambabor against HIV-1 in vitro and the hibition of HIV-1 replication in humans still is not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosizations were observed, as with other kinsavir treatments, the mutations were observed only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg fossil avir with 100mg of ritual twice a day in the study ESS100732, a virological failure up to week 48, with 14 isolates could be genotypically investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 out of 14 children, where a virological failure within the 59, demonstrated with Proteasehemently, showed drug patterns, which were similar to those who were with adults.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing based analyses of the activity of the activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with Proteasehemmer-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defined resistence as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147A / V, I84V and L90M in connection with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with a diminished likelihood of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to any additional data, and it is advised to adapt the current interpretative systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on photypic resistance testing, analyses of clinically phenomenal interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data on the activity of the activity of Ambabor / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with Proteasehemmer protector.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four, with a reduced sensitivity to Ambabor associated genetic patterns, produces a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the resistance to cross-resistance between ampbabor and other proteasement numbers for all 4 Fosampitavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on the twenty-five antiretroviral patients, a drug resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolate), Indinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 Isolate), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolate), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolate), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolate) and Tidenavir (three of 24 Isolate) and Tidenavir (four of 24 Isolate).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice-versa, Ambaboons retains its activity against some other protewear inhibitor isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early demolition of a scorching therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits, which can take effect on the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the effectiveness of agresase in combination with kinsavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study in which with PI (600 mg twice a day) and nucleosidanalogy (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SoC) with a PI, mainly with the lowest Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to aisase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the research study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis demonstrated the non-subsistence of APV / Konavir compared to the SoC-PI Group in relation to the time-adjusted average changes of output value (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-undervoltage threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The cover of the efficacy of unobooised Agenera is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged from 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Aprase has been tested three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg of times daily, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose to be given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs together with Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study included plasma-HIV 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with an median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the therapy optimization should be considered with PI pre-treated children of the expected benefits of "unobooised" Agenera.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Ambabor is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax is lowered by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) administered together with Ambabor (600 mg twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambabor with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ambabor 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Hence the minimum concentrations in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of reorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and allows to close a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Ambabor from the bloodstream in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unbound amplotr that remains the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn equalir remains constant, the percentage of the open-active ingredient varies depending on the total medication levels in the Steady State above the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, pharmaceuticals, CYP3A4 must induce or secrete or a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution if they are given at the same time using maple (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of generic capsule capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily Ambabor exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambabor is a solution of 14% less bioavailability than from the capsules; therefore, bladder solutions and aisase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, hence the effect of kidney function based on elimination of Ambabor and Ritonavir is likely.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatments will lead to Ambabor plasma, comparable to those who are obtained to healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Ambabor twice a day without simultaneous administration of kinsavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on the carcinogenicity with Ambabor in mice and rats arrived in male animals benigne hepatocycellular Adenoms with dosages of 2-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of Ambabor.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocycellular Adenoms and carcinomas has not yet been cleared and the relevance of these observed effects for human beings is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposition data on humans, both clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, little indications of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and in-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial inhibiting tests (Amit Test), mouse-lymphoma test, microkernels included in human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambabor nor mutanotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical life through the AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of chorus after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity attitudes, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both of the controls and with Ambabor animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma position, which was significantly higher (rats) or significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage, however, were observed a series of minor changes, including thymus ongation and low-level skeletal changes, which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Alevase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kinsavir (booster), higher doses of chorus (1200 mg twice a day) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Aprase capsules is 20mg of Ambabor / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Ambabor that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Ambabor in plasma, which were obtained at the combination of Ambabor (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ambabor (600 mg twice a day) in combination with 100 mg kinsavir is administered twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Ambabor and Kaletra can not be given, but there will be a close-meshed monitoring, because the effectiveness and inconvenience of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Estenirenz in combination with Ambabor and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protein-inhibitor would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If this drug is used together, caution is necessary; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance is to be done as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Ambabor and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required along with aisase, at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although no clinical data is required.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nidpin, nidpin, nimodipine, nidpin and Verapamil can be increased by amotbulation, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>

<seg id="2083">In the case of overdose the patient is to be observed at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures can be led.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Ambabor in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated in both acute and chronic lymphocytomatic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of Ambabor is in the area of 0.012 to 0,08 µm at acute infected cells and is 0,41 µm at chronic inous cells (1 µm = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Vice-versa, Ambaboons retains its activity against some other protewear inhibitor isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the therapy optimization should be considered with PI pre-treated children of "unobooised" Agenera.</seg>

<seg id="2216">This placebo-controlled evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in this placebo-controlled clinical trials involving Imiquimod creme frequently come to local skin reactions, including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), Exceration / leaves (23%) and öder (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This according to investigational clinical evidence shows that in these studies using Imiquimod creme very often lead to severe erythema (31%), heavy erosion (13%), and heavy damage (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the study of Imiquimod application for the treatment of acute keratpants alopezie with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidentally unique oral intake of 200 mg of Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically significant side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg. was normalized in hypotonia that normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of the alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 approvals relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that effectiveness in relation to a full release of the inclinations in an Imiquimod treatment is superior to placebo over 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In total, 60% of all patients treated with Imiquimod treated patients with inclinicities; this was 20% of the 105 (95% CI) in patients with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete press release could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, versus 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod at five-time use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>

<seg id="2231">Authorised indications of external feigning, actinic keratpants and superfizial basal cell carcinoma occur in pairs of paediatric patients usually not checked and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials at children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the study evaluated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks / week).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod-cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute keratpants was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bag) and in the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bag).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated semiconductor period was approximately 10times higher than the 2-hour half-value after subcutaneous use in a previous study; that points to an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low in the age of 6 - 12 years of low and comparable to the healthy adults and adults with acute keratpants or superfiziarian basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal Toxicity, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice during three days a week induced no tumors at the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and not mutations, it is a risk for human exposure because of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the effective free cream, formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, it was investigated mainly the safety of the medicine, but it was also measured its effectiveness (using its effect in terms of reduction of gag concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the gag levels in the urine around 60%, and half of the treated children pointed out a normal liver on the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>

<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued Genzyme Europe B.V. permit a permit to transfer Aldurazyms to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using Cho-Mammoth cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymes in patients with secured diagnostics of a Muammar ysacchariot I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased when the patient contributes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion reactions that are defined as any correlation between the side effect that occurs during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically, these patients should also be monitored engmeshy, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitational installations are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the Phase 3 clinical study, virtually all patients IgG antibodies against Laronidase represent, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction need to be treated with caution (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience regarding the recovery after a longer interruption, it must be cautious because of the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after a disruption of treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2297">In the case of a slight or medium-severe infusion reaction, the treatment with antihistamol and Paracetamol / ibuprofen would be scaled and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are caused to decrease the antihistamol and Paracetamol / Ibuprofen treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because there is a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect implications for pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns that were exponated across the breast milk over breast milk, is recommended to not breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical trials were classified mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase-3 study and their extension of a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are frequently performed in the following table after the following standings: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tracts and lungs in history were also severe reactions, including bronchospasmus, breathing and facial expressions (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyma, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly serious injuries and treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) 13 / 45 patients were not provable to have been identified by Radioimmunopreparation (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients who never came to Serokonia.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody-levels showed a robust reduction in gag levels in the harn while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of gag in the harn was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed marginal to low neutral-neutralizing effect on enzymatic laronida activity in vitro, which appeared the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag at Harn.</seg>

<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly absorbed from the circulation and cells in the lympsosomes, the most likely source of Mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study at age 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients had been developed from the middle phenotype, and only a patient rejected the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an associated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the estimated value, and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>

<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the gag levels in the harn (µg / mg creatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the study period remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease ation between the patients receiving a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes corresponding to five efficacy variable (range of shoulder-range AHI and visual acuity) was generally a improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients that were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with heavy transverse form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">For four patients, the dose of increased GAG- Spiegel in the Harn was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In multiple patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium run-form indicate a normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe distortion form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2376">During seven days before the first dose of Pemetremixed must be taken at least 5 doses of folate and consumption must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemometed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need a intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) during the week before the first pemetric dose as well as after any third-term business cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who received pemetrexed, a complete blood-image should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, Dosage examination needs to be held under the ages of the Nadirs of the blood-image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the predicted treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, the patients must be treated correspondingly in tables 1, 2 and 3, which apply for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity of degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the patient must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient needs the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be aborted if in patients after 2 dose inductients or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that patients at the age of 65 years, or higher compared to patients aged 65 years, an elevated by-risk factor exists.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data to unquestionable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no dose adaptations which may be transmitted by recommended dose adaptions for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Data base in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function permit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Biliruby limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the lower limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in respect to the bone market. Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their total neutropenia is again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cytense once again achieved a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutropenia, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity as it was observed in the previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hematological and non-harmonized toxicity, such as neutropenia, neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was considered as a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be treated with pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylate measure of reduction in toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney insufficiency (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min), the simultaneous intake of non-steroid anti-oxidation (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy, lasting 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who have a therapy with pemetremixed have to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-value for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetry (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients, where these events occurred, had associated risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, patients with clinically significant fluid buildup in the transcellular space should be considered a drainage of the effuction in front of the pemetric treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were also reported in clinical trials with pemetrexed occasionally if this ingredient was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuplomas (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contra-indicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiematic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group is not sufficient information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug preserves the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three major studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy regimens which are severe or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi were treated in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which have been treated for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi were treated in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be strengthened by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can lengthen the thickened collage, patients with anamnestibuster Obstipation or Signs of a subacute Ileus must be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is provided with the simultaneous interpreting of Palonosetron based on drugs that lengthens the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is lengthened or that tend towards such an extension.</seg>

<seg id="2639">In pharmacokinetic simulations, the overall exposure of 0.25 mg Palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposition (AUC0- ∞), which was measured after one-earlier intravenous administration of 0.75 mg, the Cmax was higher after one-time intravenous dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys, and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron on less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies of metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 has been involved in lower measurements, the CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 metabolism of the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination after an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchangeable agent made about 40% of the recommended dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous camera inspection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the Clearance Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of clinical studies showed evidence that Palonosetron can only block ionic channels only in very high concentrations which may extend to the ventricular de- and repolarisation, which can extend the slung duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about thirty times of therapeutic exposure when humans), which were given every day over two years, led to a proliferation of liver tumors, endocrine neopes (in thyroid gland, pituerenmarrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of hepatitis C approved the treatment of the medicine for the treatment of Alpheon 6 million is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means Alpheon was supposed to be similar to a biological medicine named Roferon-A with the same arztely effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Remedy").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon was to treat the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C (a viral infection) of hepatitis C (a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage, in addition, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that prove the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference physician to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study, the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Further, concerns have been noted that the data on stability of the drug and the drug-market drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon Retardant the disease in more patients than at the reference detergent, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test was initiated in the study to investigate the question of what the drug forms a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies, special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetigo (a crucifying formation of incoming skin infection) and small inous infirs (Riss- or chives), worsening and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo shall not be used for treatment of infections who have been demonstrably or probably caused by methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the surface area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient claims no treatment after two or three days, the doctor should again examine the patient and consider alternative treatments in consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was left to the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients with placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin-dogs, about 90% of the patients were enrolled in both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, Altargo was diagnosed in the treatment of abscesses (failed hollow habitats in the body tissue) or of infections which have been caused by MRSA, which is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation in the Contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Humanitarian Relief Substances Committee (CHMP) announced that the advantages of Altargo caused by short-term skin infections in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections from the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirs, depreciation or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd., a approval to the Council of Altargo into the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients in which there are no improvement within two to three days, should not even be examined and considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of an awareness or serious local irritation by the application of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully caught and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to the treatment of infections when MRSA is known or presumed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary trials, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin, Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy is expected to be considered if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected passage occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical resources on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasmistress concentrations that were reached in humans after topical application, a clinical relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin obe increased to the poor skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure after therapeutic application in patients, dose adaptations are not necessary, if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive xizity according to oral ingestion and are insufficient in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the reddish / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continues to be terminated, is between the benefits of stagnation for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials on 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo have applied, the most frequently reported adverse event on the event was about 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of reactivism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis caused by interaction at a certain binding point of the bacterial ribosomes which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of ribosomal P-binding and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to the binding of this binding point, Pleuromutiline block the Peptidyltransfer, partially P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the local prevalence of resistance should appear in the use of retapamulin at least some infection forms, a advice should be aimed at by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treat S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin salbe was placed daily under occlusion to intact and scoring for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamulin Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sample took place in days 3 or 4 with adult patients each before mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption on humans in accordance with topical application of 1% obe on 200 cm2 (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) is 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP-inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under small participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro inspection on genetic mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernels for in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been achieved by up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application to 200 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxic study in rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to which ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development of development (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ovary) and maternal toxicity were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the permit must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as shown in the module 1.8.1, will present and works before the product is marketed, and as long as the product is used.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of permission to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities are obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities as described in the Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all the additional updates by the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in CHMP's Guideline on Risk Management System for the Spinal Center for Human use, the updated RMP will be submitted to the next periodic Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">To show irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated spot, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salts, creams or lotions on the surface that is treated with Altargo if it was not expressly indicated by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the salad of clubs look at one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After the attachment of the ointment you can cover the affected area with a steriline bandage or a gazing tape, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic putsch, which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag that contains 0,5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambient is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between a and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient is applied in one of two doses of the vaccine, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may be reached first after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if during immunisation a low risk of hepatitis B infection is made and ensured that the vaccine will be managed by two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refractive dose of Hepatitis A or B is desired, ambient or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have no vaccines by assisting the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and the surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix also contains the same components as the 18rix adult vaccine since 1996 and has been approved in Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one out of three doses taken in the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adult identical ingredients contain some of the data used for the application of Twinrix adult, also as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of protective concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a 6-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambient temperature led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection on developing antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of ambient temperature was similar in a six-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, soreness of the injection plant, redness, placiness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002: the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologica. a permit for public transport from Ambirix in the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the primers with Ambirix consists of two vaccinations, where the first dose is given at the appointment of choice and the second dose to be administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a remote control is requested both for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovaluine vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B (anti-HAV) antibody-antibody antigen observed after an initial appearance and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as the vaccine with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not completely assured whether immunointent individuals who have addressed on a hepatitis A- vaccine, they may not need to be protected as a protection, as they can also be protected from immune memory due to immunologic memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, in the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, according to the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization system is recommended with the combination pulp, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">At hematalysis patient and persons with disruptions of the immune system, the basic anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibody is achieved, so in these cases, the gift of additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the muscle can lead to a suboptimal impetus, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in case of thrombocytopenie or blood clots, Ambirix can be injected as an exception as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular offering.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients under immunosrescent therapy or in patients with immunodefects, this may not be sufficient irresponsible immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that has been carried out with 3 vaccination doses of this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mud, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thiomersal- and preservative inoculant vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered at a total of 1027 vaccinations ranging from 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matiness on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the treatment of Ambirix at 50.8% of the subjects compared with 39.1% in subjects according to the gift of a dose of 3-cans combine vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccine cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had received ambiance had been vaccinated over pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose and have been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matches was comparable high (that means over the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects, the ambient temperature received, compared to 36.2% on subjects who received 3-doses offset pulp).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of embossed pain and paintness was low and comparable, that was observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reaction reactions and general reactions were comparable to the ambient submerge with the 3-doses combination of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, for the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, vaccination with ambient pain was reported as a common occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines which reported severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccination schemas with the combination of 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine, was statistically significant not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were carried out in vaccines at the age of 1 up to including 15 years, the serene rates for anti-HAV is 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 abdicated dose (d. h. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBS were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, the month 6 abdicated dose (that is in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined pulp with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">At 289 people whose immunity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose-treatment significantly higher than with ambient.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immunity, which were reached in a clinical comparative study with 1- and 11-year-olds a month after the end of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with ambient or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combined 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be demonstrated after at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix at 0-6-months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response shown in this study was comparable to both antigens that were formed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination pulp, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis B-B and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies were comparable 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambient temperature of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus-, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine was given, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after the resuspation by eye-note to any other particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enrich enzyme already in the newborns (within the first 28 living days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-bearing form (inadequate enzymes that manifests itself after the first life month), an indication of hypermenial encephalopathy exists in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sip disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulators.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the appropriate daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children weighing less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early-solid lack of Carbamylphosphatease or ornithintranometer bamylase, substitution is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinate deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with sip disorders, as a risk for the formation of oil spophagulcera, if the tablets do not reach immediately on the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used for patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and furnish infections only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and separation of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous injection of phenylacetic to young rats, high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowing of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturing of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be detected if phenylacetic will be eliminated in the breast milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contra-indicated during the breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS represented at least 56% of patients at least one undesired event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anogenetic patient who developed metabolic encephalopathy in connection with lactam, heavier hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5-month-old small child with an exceptionally good dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetic, which showed a dosisite neurotoxicity by intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is a metabolized - active link which is conjugated by acetylacetylglutamine that will be eliminated via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative vehicles for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with body disorders can be assumed that each gram can be produced in sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>

<seg id="2837">The prediction of the onset of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infantry, and the disease resulted in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their sticking-free analogy within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetic), protein reduced calorie and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase survival rate newborated at postpartal (however, within the first life month).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was suffering from many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-solid form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of ornithintranhic bamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperbular encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein direduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological system can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyate is oxidized to phenylacetic, which is conjugated in liver and kidney-enzyme with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in an empty healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis as well as recurrent gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrat in tablet form, 15 minutes after the impregnation of phenylbutyrate were found.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary fractional disorders or hemoglobbiopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was provable to guarantee an phenylacetic in plasma during the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis which have been treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentration were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine above the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to treat patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood access to the heart), for instance with unstable Angina (a form of pain in the breast basket with different strength) or myocardial infarction (cardiac attack) without "Stuplift" (a abnormal measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients who underwent a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help people with Angina or heart attack on maintaining blood flow to heart and increasing the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS where the effects of angiox in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared to conventional combination treatment with heparine (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient is often a stent (a short tubes that remains in the arteries to prevent a shutter), and additionally they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year in total as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI was Angiox in relation to all indicators as effective as Heparine, except for heavy bleeding in which there was much more effective than Heparine.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be excessive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other herdsudine, or any other components.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinas, which binds to the catalytic Centre as well as on the Anionenbindle region of Thrombin regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid stage or in clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin on Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin unfolds slowly the binding of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombin regenerates.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before Angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy blood flow was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neural, intraocular bleeding or bleeding within the point of point, reducing the haemulation mirror of ≥ 3 g / dL with unknown bleeding point, refining due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-line and triple endpoints of a randomised double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients complained to a PCI (Replace-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided detailed information about the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients that undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptide is a catastropism in its amino acid components with subsequent recovery of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary Metabolit, which resulted from the split of the Arg3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin uneffectively.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) in the abdominal wall, injected to the upper arm or the upper arm with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin delivery (sugar) in blood, or insulin does not process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin differs differs very marginally of human insulin and the change means it seems faster and a shorter period of action has a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in use with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin delivery, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where the body of insulin is not effective, Apidra has been examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving type 1 diabetes after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% compared to insulin inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration of 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who are probably hypersensitive (allergic) against isinglulisin or one of other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted, if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a approval for the public transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of pancreas, thigh or deltamuskels or subcutaneous infusion in the area of pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the diminished Gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin resistance, the insulin demand for patients with a limitation of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of actual strength, the brand (her- Steller), the isintyps (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of delivery can draw a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or abortion of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin requiring type diabetes, may result in hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin delivery should be under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change to change the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia (ACE) inhibitors, solvents, fluoxetine, fioamin-oxidase, pentoxifylline, propoxylic, salicylic acid, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as Betablooser, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin the symptoms of adrense counterparts are weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin delivery is over into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor will it be absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are listed from clinical studies of which adverse reactions of drugs are listed, grouped after system organically (very common: ≥ 1 / 10; &lt; 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000); not well-known (frequency on the basis of available bathe data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or Tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to change the injection site within the injection unit, in a sequence a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by a intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriated person or by intravenous administration of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the most severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous tissue in effect occurs faster and the real time is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin pulses showed insulin-relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0,15 E / kg a proportional-proportional pulcosity effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase of glucosity effects, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieved full glucose monitoring effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was clearly shown that insulin resistance can be achieved in 2 minutes before the meal is a comparable post-denial glycaemic control, such as the human insulin that is 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin is achieved in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denial control was obtained than with human normal insulin that has been given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is anchored 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved in the normal insulin that is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery within 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal was given (figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin resistance in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - subsequent) after the onset of the meal in comparison to human body-insulin, which was 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
