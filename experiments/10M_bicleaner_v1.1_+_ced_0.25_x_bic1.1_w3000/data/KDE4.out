the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , emb@@ ell@@ ed folder with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object should be smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder is reflected in the size of the size of the entries . in this way , large files can be detected , even if it can be easily detected in the folder hier@@ archy . according to that &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have a reasonable color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on color mode , can be either depth for the easy detection of the pollution @-@ depth or the image of another file association like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can define whether it is at all indicated , only then , if enough space available to display , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate right @-@ angles should be used ( whereby it is possible to define the relative position of let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle ) .
when algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should generally be observed , that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be available . note that less space is lost for frames if the rect@@ angle is square .
as a split of the area of the area is provided for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is beneficial to the lab@@ eling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to parameters that are possible to be square . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum shown surface for an entry on the menu entry view . instead , an R@@ aut@@ en@@ sample is drawn into the area of the above @-@ level entry to indicate that this surface is actually covered by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry .

what is a digital data administration - away from the fashion word ? digital data administration considers every part of the process after the picture has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos taken , sc@@ anned or digital photos , does not carry out a form of digital data management . however , most of us do not take this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect , backup , backup , backup , backup , backup , backup , backup , optimize , waiting , and export image files .

met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data stored in an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you don &apos;t know more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not know how many photos you have , then you will definitely not know &amp; digi@@ tised ; the base the met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed to save both in a database and a safe archi@@ ving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you want to setup your system in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos should be back if you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; make sure you have to change at some larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found fast over your location . if you do have enough photos on the same place . if you make enough photos , you &apos;ll be able to use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant intake of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % are working and you will then not want to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing easier . split new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata options in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ al ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what changes ? in addition , a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor is available for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should select any photo keywords , mo@@ ons and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos .
now let &apos;s talk with keyword , key words , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then it is added ; automatically the tree for you add the pictures to the right spot . the conversion of the Hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub @-@ building on one another . the changed keywords are being updated by &amp; digi@@ al .
the chart shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata designs itself . this is a very rough representation , since each block consists of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data refer to all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to detect your met@@ ad@@ ata .
you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos simply look , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are safe to see how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you &apos;ll see some details to see people , the place .
and now I say you this is the landing area of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may possibly even hear the silence . the let@@ tering has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others that consider your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is the importance to view to Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it &apos;s fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ al ; you can specify a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alp@@ habet . K@@ DE even export a spell chec@@ ker for you . if you export your pictures into web galleries and then you will have to tell the story of the Web @-@ gallery . so you have to tell the story for opening a second time .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already using light speed .
the possibilities offered by ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already in@@ calcul@@ able . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repe@@ ater your journeys by pictures with ge@@ ographic data . you can also see the pictures at reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also to the work of others .
the following description tells you what information comes in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ al ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for writer and authors ) : this field ought to add your name , or the names of the photographers , for example to protect the photographers name , then the name of a company or organization is not to be changed . this field supports neither com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for Constitutional Line ) : linked to the author . examples include the author of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles like : employee photographer , free photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a mem@@ o of car field , it must be filled as well .
editor ( syn@@ onym for distributors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ field to identify who is offering that . if the photographer works for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is an image photo , then the group / agency is given the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer , can only delete the solution for this problem , digital water@@ marks . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important against it .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ al ; it will provide a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have lost on the streets or a fire . this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest database development company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated for longer than a few years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality , which are longer more difficult to get more difficult , and more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece for a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your mess@@ aging room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices . the best DVD recording device are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you &apos;re getting much reliable . therefore , it &apos;s about the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you were just written . therefore , they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control h@@ um . despite this massive protection it al@@ ates through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a favourable program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster . it works on Windows and Linux ; but it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications which damage damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format &apos;s format of HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that &apos;s been said to CDs and DVDs , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slow down with a good recording device to qualit@@ atively high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . read the media with a description , date &amp; author marking and then on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves . your production guaranteed includes a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field@@ bus over the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal : flo@@ or@@ disc
in brief : Dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In a lower temperature control , the most common trouble code , SM@@ ART may termin@@ ate this error . some of the SM@@ ART errors are to termin@@ ate the immediate failure . these are particularly readers and publishing coun@@ ters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is a total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also loss data loss due to a blackout before you have backed up the files , but these losses are usually able to recover without major problems .
while most electrical equipment is not much less , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ uts . these can cause serious damage . at your machine , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause damage , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect themselves from the inevitable that will lead to a loss of time and money .
most widespread protection against rapi@@ ds is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy @-@ heat and the rest is gro@@ unded . however , it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not any plug @-@ in system also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that it guarantees the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention that it protects against lighten@@ ing and protects the properly connected devices .
as a over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should note that even all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers are also able to make a over@@ voltage for your modem . some manufacturers offer connectivity to your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable fashion and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore you are very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of un@@ break@@ able data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a dis@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ load , these devices can automatically exp@@ ose your data automatically . some models allow you to keep up your data until the stream is running again . if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they are getting the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
don &apos;t worry about the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare up to euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can get you for less than &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be protected for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you are protecting your computer with it . at the end , you are always thinking about drinking all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as the backup goal for your software . Google Shared storage is a further popular offering with any quantities of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives too . however , very expensive - 40 GB cost per dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . moreover , you need to send data over the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . this is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available to photos . your free memory is available at 1 GB and you will not have any more photos available , in the case by Flick@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data security , web solutions are very safe . data transfer errors are automatically adjusted instantly with the TCP protocol and the large firms use a backup and a par@@ cel storage . therefore , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are due to transmission errors . the file system is required at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody says that if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ troubled until you have no protection in your hardware . no one seems to have any protection for it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable ma@@ ins parts are another source for transfers , as they generate interfaces within the data stream . these errors remain un@@ noticed in normal fil@@ esystem .
even if you are currently not affected by trans@@ missions problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turn@@ tables on lower level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ ypass file system . this is still in the alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms for use and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % for job systems . in Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft can be 50 % .
data loss because of viruses is less common than most . it leads to a lower damage , than for instance , theft or new installations . and it is currently based on Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer sigh@@ ted anymore .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS was minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to give the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the exam@@ ining process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human defects are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture setting of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that during the technology , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are heading towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if these resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is optim@@ ised for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions , you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; thus , you are not able to hit any other for data loss . thus , you make sure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous just like the new installation of your operating system , replacing plates or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole space or entire house .
therefore , Des@@ iring is always a not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , it is a common cause for a data loss in spite of backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files changed since the last complete system . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the full @-@ full backup and the latest differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of files changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time back on which one such backup has been made . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system the next with the exception which is only fast@@ ed and not continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that can easily be set up on your machine . unlike script controlled FTP sessions , or other types of file transfer encryption , r@@ sync only copied the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you would like to increase security via ssh .
back important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or a different optical medium .
this approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually according to which you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
thus valuable images will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table because of its nature , all of you have to look with caution while time flies . unfortunately , there is no other possibility to be compatible with caution . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered according to the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . if you have an old system that &apos;s important for reading your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and f@@ use technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the ability to change a system in its size . it actually means to enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with set up and put the range that you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and go to a new plate :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang them .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ 2,3 ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS ; change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day doesn &apos;t exist any software there is , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard for GIF . but it can be los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can use gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ ality data for improved color instruction , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow compression . this format we would recommend to store your images .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as an image format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ loss com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism ( Def@@ end ) . however , there is a problem that this format has been adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed @-@ free and open resource image that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the requirements of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer provides D@@ NG already now and we hope to use the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon .
this is probably one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . it is a file information containing the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; is stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format . X@@ MP fits in addition to the link between the met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the shell @-@ format is drawn up separately . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of purposes and business models . for the activities of D@@ CM@@ I , work on architecture and modelling , discussions and communal work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enlighten@@ ing efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as pictures on the camera order , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ lo@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for fine processing , you can use external programs . once you come back with &amp; digi@@ al pictures , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata once again . these have been cut apart from other programs .
protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it in Web@@ gal@@ eries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact covers , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ al . in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description , as you can already add on your hard disk . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your alb@@ end@@ ental bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; connect this with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it down . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect it to your camera . if the connection is made , a pre @-@ indicator appears at the bottom end and the thum@@ b@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras don &apos;t present file names and a symbol for the file association for each file , photos , movies , music , etc . on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to download camera information about any entry . with the side@@ bars properties and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or the met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras don &apos;t all know any information available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata , such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ ad@@ ata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or the picture format . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ al ; with downloading the photos are not deleted , and we recommend you check the pictures safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos you want to select the default optional methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; select the button you want to download and then download the selected button . the button is gra@@ yed as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have been downloaded here yet not by &amp; digi@@ al ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in front window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you are using the buttons all download or chosen files , a dialog box can be found in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ al ; download the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete these from the camera . you can delete all at once , by removing the button extingu@@ ishing all . if you only want to delete a few , you need to select them first and then remove delete ID .
please note that there is no possibility to restore images from the camera . you should not verify that if the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ al ; they should be carefully deleted if you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera &apos;s camera , you should read this about the camera &apos;s memory , as this is much qu@@ icker .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful , after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can be done to double file names if you have photos of different super@@ vis@@ eries in the same album . so it can be useful , the date and time when the image was made to integrate the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , it will automatically create a folder per day .
the options while the transmission opens up three more options , which are conducted before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want to use a different date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S . if you need to add the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the file name in lower@@ case . or , in case letters if you prefer .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is indicated below the name indicating the camera in the preview mode . your settings are stored and automatically used , if you open the camera window .
digi@@ plug ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation at the time frame . not all cameras put this information ready . in the section page bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver these information , you can adjust the picture in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom range of the window .
if your camera is made information about the date on which the photo was made available , you can create &amp; digi@@ plug . all images with the same date are provided in the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date will be provided in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras points this information available . in the section page bar met@@ a data you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to expand this option . use the button extension and select the option of date @-@ based sub@@ albums at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from their machine to their camera is the button to download . select the file extensions dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select the files you are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , where the images should be uploaded into . select a folder dialog for the camera . select OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . this is a position of what can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers could link it interesting to link an image with a precise distribution site . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ to@@ graphic the area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten the photo , where exactly the photo has been made , you can click with one click to open the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ al user , or want to locate the location the location of the photo is to contribute to the position data of a photo .
the question is , how are the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has a lot of GPS data , such as the direction , traction and map reference . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via re@@ working the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) , and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a couple who work with GPS recipi@@ ents together . either as a map module or by transfer@@ ring the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel only . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can extract the same under &amp; lin@@ ux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that uses the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ dict@@ ated coordinates using the example of map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
digi@@ plug ; try to give you so much control over its work procedures as possible . there are many settings that have to access to the behaviour of the digi@@ plug . in order to set up these settings , you have to switch to the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
selecting action can display embedded preview or image editing can be set . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option is selected to download from the camera &apos;s interface . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this gives a more detailed description of the author , this field must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this must not be the author here if this is listed for a news agency as such as Reuters or Associated Press . if the picture is a photo photo , then the group or agency will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ rim . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ al . these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ al ; imported without losing .
image uses as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments you will add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . this way , your labels will also be read by other images , they are over@@ written by the digi@@ tization .
the settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter in the main window over a file , depending on selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ al ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to fix , which file types &amp; digi@@ al , you can add the file extensions to this list and remove . Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , who has none of these extensions , has been ignored by &amp; digi@@ al ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by press the button on the right of each category .
the flag of the lumin@@ ance of digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page on the default values . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . option &amp; quot ; In the whole image file lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing is used in a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this tool here . you can turn the tool bar when you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ exposed and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image editing , this visible mode can be adjusted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the pictures will be encoded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article on Wikipedia .
with the setting of P@@ NG files , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG use a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value on a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch def@@ end -@@ com@@ pres@@ sion@@ let@@ m for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it doesn &apos;t have an impact on image quality , since the defect is due to loss .
with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can select los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the loss of loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ al ; the image processing is only a picture viewer for photographs . currently , it is developing a very fast tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of image processing .
the default setting is that all green pixels are equal to ultra @-@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is somewhat soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal rate of details . this option shows the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gr@@ ate pattern with V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the bald will use the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used if the bald is not set . standard is a solid colour balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors it has the effect that exposed images in four steps have more details in the sh@@ lich@@ ens . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the nick@@ name , so the parts of your images are burned , as passing through the in@@ ability of your camera to view the top @-@ out white in the settings . use some unusual results since it shows the sh@@ lich@@ ter in various ros@@ is . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the sp@@ urs .
this is possible as blue pixels in general not so quickly filling like green and red . &amp; digi@@ al ; and d@@ cra@@ v therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels . of course this is a matter of how many color or white they want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
put the L@@ umin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set him a bit higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should be conservative .
a demo algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image files that have many cameras and that is also known as a Matrix @-@ colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure .
&amp; digi@@ al ; and D@@ cra@@ w have three alternatives available : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was produced as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ o@@ gene@@ ity ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ v . however , it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts to the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color copy of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ t@@ ants here . this is certainly the best method for color @-@ soft correction , as you will be carried out during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as this should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and digi@@ plug ; information such as the color information from an color space in the others are to be translated with the colors as exact as possible .
if a picture in image editing is open / color management module with shell files start .
color profile ste@@ wards Find here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ al ; exam@@ ines this folder during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; can be reset to your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the shell file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colour@@ ing not the entire screen .
the input profile should match the camera manufacturers and model you don &apos;t fit . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain dy@@ ton@@ mapping or g@@ amm@@ ac@@ or@@ tur . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not have to do for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the color mapping themselves .
there are other options like the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your picture would print a smaller colour range as your printer can have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated with you , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obvious to suit the colour profile for them . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , there is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together . this answer is obviously un@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion makes the style recognize : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ scapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ und S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; features and digi@@ tization : many modules have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . choose the modules that you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ plug . these modules appear as new entries in menu of the main window and additionally you will find some in the context menu of the preview menu .
short @-@ commands for tasks that can be done by modules , can be set in the menu below the Settings menu .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be accessed via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ in@@ .org or the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other att@@ ack@@ ers switch off the met@@ ad@@ ata , or off , which are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the display .
camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right , there is a button automatic detection , which is being connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure the camera is connected . currently , there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active when you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera type . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / them , on which you hang your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , display them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any particular note for your camera . this is displayed in the main menu &apos;s menu cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option acknowle@@ d@@ gement dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can set the talk talk of &amp; digi@@ al ; when solving a photo in an album you can find more details in the sections of a photo and delete a album .
editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be dis@@ closed by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any refund . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes dialog .
you can also display the display of the spl@@ ash guard of &amp; digi@@ al ; in the starting line . this is spe@@ eding under conditions the launch of &amp; digi@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Start of the start to new photos came out &amp; digi@@ al ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos came . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ al . when something comes from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ al ; you know if it should be removed from the database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
different colours schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ al ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select you under settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ al ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
digi@@ plug ; contains a rapid image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view and correction and improvement . the image processing can be started using a click with the left mouse button to preview / Edit menu and selection of the updated ads / processor .
the image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . so , some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ al . so , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section image processing .
a status line at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using file stores or button stores from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo as soon as you have stored the image .
so you should install a copy of your image before you change it . this can you do with file stores .
as long as you haven &apos;t stored the photo , you can restore the original label by repe@@ ating or edit the button The button restoration of image editing in the tool bar . you then lose every change that you have done in the photo since the last saving .
virtually every action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can reverse , by selecting editing and select Edit from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should select the key combination , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to reverse and re@@ produce C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ res@@ p @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; you can press a moment longer , and select a console menu in the tool , receive a console menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes on current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can go in and out in the photo , in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the command menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will also enter the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can change it from the digi@@ plug dialog . you can view this in the digi@@ plug dialog . see the section on setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , select the image and select the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . all image files can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting print assistance . if you follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , the important information and actions for selected images available . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation spl@@ itter , also available in image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is on display :
multiple clicking on the same riders make the side@@ bar appear and disappear again in the edge .
in the inscription view , you can insert inscription with unlimited size or insert . note below . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ s fields so that you can use some other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are en@@ moul@@ ded . if you want to use the IP@@ TC in other applications , please note these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the button to apply or simply switch to the next image , the labels are stored .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata settings . this will always be selected if you have written a met@@ ad@@ ata settings .
the section assessment shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mou@@ sec@@ lick on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the key@@ cli@@ ff tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied only to one image , select this and use the context menu .
the assessment is written into the IP@@ TC field . en@@ coding follows the pattern in the following table :
the keyword below shows a search box to filter words , the keyword tree and a selection box with previously in this &amp; digi@@ al ; session announced .
the keyword tree is adjusted dynam@@ ically . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many passwords .
the input field at the lower end is another relief when typ@@ ing the keyword on a series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set up by marking the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if several pictures have been selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the section called Key@@ word filters .
the side@@ bar keyword is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar will be used with their album , - data , keyword and search results . if additionally , one or more keyword filter is used from the right @-@ hand side , only the cut of these two will be displayed . all mentioned keywords are available .
you can also draw and disman@@ tle them . if the keyword is already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it onto the selection . as a result , a dialog box that asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example shows the main window the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is indicated on no markings , which amount to three images . they were drawn with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
these search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off by default settings .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or should , you can easily change this with double click on the text and the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , looking for the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name , or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can select an extension of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing to use . the options then look as follows :

this article / Tut@@ orial was mostly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I found it mainly on &amp; digi@@ al ; s specific implementation adjusted .
the reason why you set a colour@@ fully @-@ administered work@@ flow that will actually have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actual shot or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ fully re@@ designed work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors will print on your screen from your camera or scanners to print them or in the web to those coming from your digital dark chamber .
if the theme goes on color management , everybody wants to know what buttons it does need for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense does make you make proper background information about color management . in addition , links with lower information enable you to make your own informed decisions to make you desired results .
if your photo work@@ flow meets all six criteria below , you must not take care of color management .
they are working on a monitor that cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other education expendi@@ tures are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and the life for all so easy , why should one then use another color space and how to make thoughts about color towers ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ h @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color flowers , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site , and then click on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cali@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you work on the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to install your monitor . if you have to work on s@@ RGB on s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve the image in most cases . therefore , use a further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , balance , automatic and contrast extend from the menu corrected automatic correction automatically from your colors to make the best . you will be experim@@ enting with these effects , to see what is best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scal@@ ates leuk@@ emia over the whole picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing his color sha@@ ded . this function is often a mag@@ ician correction for images that are dark or balanced .
in the same way , this method is adjusted to the illumin@@ ants of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible . by this way , the compar@@ ing very good results achieved in the improvement of the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation incur@@ red in a picture or were destroyed .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes colour range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels in the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast extend : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest levels in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the bald comparison of &amp; digi@@ al ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly limited because of an colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can walk far from the original image , in case you can perform the white right in the body mode , which will work in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction shall be better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ bal@@ m @-@ bal@@ m of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you start with the menu entry of colors white off the image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left @-@ hand side the original image as well as the preview of the goal is adapted . if you want to watch the original protein settings , then it is enough to click on the lower window .
the preview of the target photos has a red markers . the lumin@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
on the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful as , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow lay@@ outs of your photos or di@@ mming down .
An@@ stat can be used with the above checks , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then anywhere on the pictures to use the colour temperature of the white @-@ size . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
additionally , you can set the bald immediately with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicator rises the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . every adjustment of the white @-@ comparison you can now store in a text file and re@@ load it later .
the default settings will return all filter values again to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will be made another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding yeast per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . however , this coding requires even more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the under@@ window for the hel@@ mets . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu in color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated route to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction . in the manual for pitch correction , you will find more information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool colour defects provides you four colour defects , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filters .
in times of the chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that developed partly developed pressure of a brief flash@@ light and followed the development of the image . this result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approximately 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase is finally generated a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation , that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it , he emb@@ ell@@ ert many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a daylight optim@@ ised colour movie produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vet offers strongly saturated colour but also some photographer , especially those who have hardly any landscapes , too much .
ne@@ on@@ ers simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light at the contrast edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images , the filter is able to load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it &apos;s not unusual that you want to correct the contrast contrast and lumin@@ osity of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the results you can use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you can get a photo with bad light conditions . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice for satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes that you can perform in preview can you confirm the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex set of gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you need for the field of sliding purposes only . specifically , the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window includes a graph of the intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , active can@@ als or the selected area . under the graph@@ s , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the picture and which can be moved to change the intensity of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the control is to post@@ p@@ one the control and make sure how the image changes .
on the right hand you can view the original and preview of the image . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated on the left , the following options are available .
Scal@@ ing : with this select box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic organization is useful .
three controllers : the top for dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ili .
the three color brush p@@ aces can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shade , middle and bright tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers used to change the output values , e.g. for example , to create a slight picture as a background , while something else is in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : with this kno@@ b , image values are automatically set in depending on the image values of the image .
save as and loading : these buttons can be stored in the file system and subsequently loaded again . the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ ds , the input will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shade , means and sun sets . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the option of over@@ exposed points controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in preview , and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input data applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct picture ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the origin@@ als and the target pattern is displayed . the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to be modified from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . most of the linear mode , linear mode , linear mode , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a trip to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones should be considered with dark pro@@ curement and that are dar@@ ker and dar@@ ker .
at the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see . if you want to change this mar@@ ker on the area you want to change , the right line is displayed on the curve . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every bend you have created can be saved and subsequently loaded in fil@@ esystem . the file format is the Gim@@ p package format .
if you create this method and the three color@@ pi@@ ds buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun@@ burn . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option of over@@ exposed indi@@ ator controls all colour channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . here , you get the effect only in preview , and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sonn@@ ent@@ ö@@ ne was applied using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original pattern ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the canal @-@ bl@@ ender of the digi@@ plug ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or modify the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel optional box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by clicking the relative allocation and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mar@@ ker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ance , it is particularly practical if you want to reduce the color components . this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color tool to create great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color is coming to a visible sound that comes from far@@ brau@@ schen and does not look at the same point in color channel and their space pattern is different in any channel different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion thereby in which you can reduce the colour @-@ color first .
save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any p@@ ender setting can thus be saved and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option of over@@ exposed points controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect just in preview , and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as pictures can be easily converted to the machine . also with a set of film roll@@ ers .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford Stop 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lenti@@ l filter . this looks good for all scen@@ eries and fits especially well to portraits in the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photographs . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange film .
Rot@@ er : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate beam distance from the time of the day . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ Filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones in the sha@@ kes . this is very similar to the process of cur@@ d of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ ia . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu input picture texture can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ .com has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and modified ( 2 ) . relief parameters has been set to 200 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool frame is adding a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
to keep the eye of an observation in the boundaries of a photo is not a easy task . an opportunity to keep its attention is to put a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to watch the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you have the desired frame type for your image . penet@@ rating the image with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) , it comes with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that makes it ideal for a bone effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : gives the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is between 1 % and 50 % .
this will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert easy to form@@ at@@ ted text in an image at any location . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and use it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , colour from the color space and character set with its properties . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set should be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any adjustment you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press on the button &quot; OK , &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
you can apply a template on a picture with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template .
the menu Image Templ@@ ates apply in the image processing can be used to put a template on a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum com@@ pressing ( 9 ) to comparison the template of file size ; please send an email to the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your template with the button basic file in the dialog . select the folder in which you select the template . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder made for the sten@@ cils , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil template . the selection of a folder gives the template of the template .
below are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to use the mouse button . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to sc@@ atter the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture . the image will be adjusted automatically the pre@@ ference size .
&amp; digi@@ al . has three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look a shar@@ per . actually , it is not a bit of psychological . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ ours and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken out of Gim@@ p and it is protected by Winst@@ on Chang .
Ref@@ ord@@ ing is probably the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the end of the digi@@ ti@@ zing process to be put together with a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras will usually need more retro@@ grade than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG image a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ening . images in the rough format must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners apply for sharp@@ ness already during reading the image . if you dis@@ able this , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get usable results by setting up a photo with the sharp@@ ening value . you can adjust with the menu entry .
but you should deal with caution when the results do not seem very naturally : sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the useful technique is used to adjust the tool ref@@ usal . you will find further information and comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . use the tool to correct soft drawing with the menu entry . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experiment with settings . the default window on the right side of the di@@ alog@@ es show you the effect on your photo .
the filter im@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove grinding of your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview can help edit the picture . the default window shows the output of the filters with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . default values are often good results and should be tried first . an increase of radius or viewer can intensi@@ fy the effect . if you generate the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the mask , noise and impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges are to be created .
the radius shows how many pixels appear on each side of an edge through the filters . high resolution images allow larger radio . you should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final solution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . therefore , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . it can therefore define a minimum difference for an edge of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones is excluded and therefore f@@ law in faces , heavens and water surface .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the painted picture ( 2 ) . in@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ate was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool refra@@ in re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright protected filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to use a picture to &amp; quot ; re @-@ focused approach than just trying to def@@ use the photo . it is used to use a technique named F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of a non@@ slip mask . you can start from the menu by simply retri@@ eving colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular manner does not work much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos; s folding a very long tail , which leads far from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is influenced in most cases even very strong from remote pixels , which causes un@@ wanted results .
circular clarity : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameters for use of this module . for most pictures , the default value is 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture should be very sharp then on hal@@ o .
correlation : an increase in correlation is to help minim@@ ise arti@@ facts . the correlation is reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , and eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of module .
smoking filter : an increase of the smoking filter may help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0,1 is only rarely useful . if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is added to the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to raise the correlation and / or the smoking filter .
matrix size : this value determines good results for the size of transformation matrix . however , an increase of the matrix size can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . every Ref@@ rac@@ ec@@ ing parameter has been set to be stored for later and then can be charged .
try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you are reading images and press com@@ pressing , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , in@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ade produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by in@@ sharp m@@ ating a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it has to produce in@@ sharp m@@ ating always art@@ ef@@ acts . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter you can show that it is the optimal lens filter . practically the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least just as good as the in@@ sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small @-@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this picture was taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to in@@ sufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the de@@ com@@ ers de@@ fies the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the colour @-@ tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool , to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with un@@ pi@@ ell@@ os@@ er speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the riders and advanced settings .
detailed information p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of details . a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions of smooth and detail . a value of 0.9 should receive details that no sharp@@ ening should be necessary . note that the details preser@@ vation should always be ordered .
seal dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly in all directions ; if you have a value near 1 only in one direction only . if you have a fil@@ ming or CCD , a high value of wave @-@ like pattern will produce a high value of similar patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best eliminated at a value of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smoo@@ thing factor via all@@ ot@@ . p then defines the relative glasses . therefore , put this value to the degree of noise in your image .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies greater structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ent effect , it must be higher than 3 .
re@@ petitions : indicates how often the algorithm will run through . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be selected as well . make sure that small angle produce a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel gl@@ ancing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubles but the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded again .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast in work . but it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the demo@@ li@@ tion button .
below you can see how pictures to be corrected as small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a pec@@ uli@@ ar black f@@ law in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and shown the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ al ; Smo@@ king production is a very powerful tool to reduce image sequences . it uses an copyright protected algorithm from Peter Heck@@ el .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable images filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. of dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about Sensor@@ rau@@ ghts by digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene featuring a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the lower window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can p@@ ave the picture above the picture and the color in it is sm@@ ooth@@ ed and with smaller flaws .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to verify the filter changes . if it is increased , smokers should change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and ru@@ de or lubric@@ ate once more .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong it can &apos;t be removed or smoke tips can occur . put it at a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ thing process that controls details of the details .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve the image . these settings don &apos;t influence the smoo@@ thing process that controls details of the details .
gamma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ulation of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas , typically stronger , but also the shadow sections .
absorption : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius can occur if it is too high can occur . if it is up to its minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove smo@@ kes and is the recommended method for this .
save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for ro@@ duction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and subsequently loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) , with the standard input was applied to standard settings .
sometimes a picture is a cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the image is a bit soft to var@@ nish with the menu entry . use the tool to sof@@ ten and experiment with the gluten . use the effect on the right side of the dialog page showing the effect of this operation on your photo .
die &amp; digi@@ al ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photography files .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ red art@@ ef@@ acts of your pictures . he is very well adapted for dig@@ itali@@ zation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local bugs in digital , original or retro@@ grade digit@@ alised images . thereby , the smoo@@ thing is done along the educational institutions and thereby gets the content of the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture is developed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ate and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ at@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and loading are exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ oring may be stored in a text file and subsequently loaded again .
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast in work . but it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can see how a photo with equ@@ it@@ ous noise can be restored . the module is applied on a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the correct one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures was applied on an old colour picture which has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which have been shown by scanning light and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and shown the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization ( tool hot@@ pixel ) allows hot@@ pixel photos that have been fitted with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels represent especially high quality raw mode , because many cameras have JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name is Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixel .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the button dark . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can connect the dark picture directly to the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . note that the wi@@ zard will notice the last dark picture and re@@ load this automatically in the next meeting again .
the picture area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture . the file show@@ case shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are empha@@ sized in all fore@@ sight areas .
select an area around the faulty pixels at the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ let : it is an average of the neighbouring pixel size . the resulting color will be assigned to all defective Pix@@ els in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
lin@@ early : all pixels represent a distance between 1 pixel block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . then , these are used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi @-@ quadra@@ tic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quadra@@ tic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a batch of quadra@@ tic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Ku@@ bisch : all pixels represent a distance of 3 or less , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the faulty pixels in the block .
below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , made of a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original picture was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ c , i.e. exposed corners , to correct a picture .
distance objects , especially in the middle and large photo format , can often not be able to illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image , by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ e@@ ject systems may also show this behavior .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . lots of center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with hand . a wide angle lens should also be used , also with center @-@ filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller than otherwise in@@ sharp@@ ening effects are created by motion .
with the great expos@@ ures of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by simul@@ ating a equivalent transformation at a rough image that is used without this filter . the tool is used for a Cent@@ er@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
check the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter with three shelves , and with three additional expos@@ ures to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of ligh@@ test absorption at the point of the largest density the filters . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density of a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ k@@ stärke , contrast , and gamma settings : the processing of a picture with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you will need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options . the controllers will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / Con@@ trast / Gamma near zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing derived from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a den@@ al and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion . colour@@ less distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
coefficient of the second degree covers the overall geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but laughs at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
coefficient of fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second degree . with negative values may be corrected , and positive values of cus@@ hion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth degree . this value seems to be stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; marked the opposite number of the parameter .
zoom : this value scal@@ ates the image size and leads through a correction of the first gra@@ dation by . negative values increase while positive the picture .
s@@ ligh@@ ten : adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview allows you to use the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values .
the ton@@ ne or cus@@ hion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all conc@@ ision or size changes . in case you perform this correction as all the first . if you cut a picture again and then a ton @-@ shaped correction would be the effect to be apparent .
to help you find the best correction , this tool represents a vertical and horizontal auxili@@ ary line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the ton / cus@@ hion distor@@ tion with the help of lines .
if you correct a cus@@ hion distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove these using the cutting tool in the menu transformer , remove from image editing or through the zoom control of this dialog .
for most pictures the ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings are the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of a ton @-@ shaped correction used on a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and shown the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can add two parameters of film portrait and film sensitivity . if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color channels can be used to produce inf@@ ra @-@ red film , especially the green channel does not make any sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ red fil@@ tr@@ ine used on a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the image of the film has been set on ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a sort of au@@ ra in the sp@@ urs .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filters film production is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer has large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ si@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to get rid of a tim@@ eless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to release this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of gran@@ ul@@ arity . the default value is , although higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filters several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ based effect on a black / white painting . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil mixture . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing the glass , or from the other side , the sni@@ per .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original pattern is marked with the ( 1 ) and it is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 @-@ pixel wide picture is 1 and ext@@ ant 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to define a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changed for this effect . it is helpful when you would like to sk@@ etch out what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator is choosing the default size and the lower adjust the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adju@@ sting the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filters engraving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ al ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey and mon@@ dar@@ ling landscape .
depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ tion @-@ effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the picture in the cells , and lets it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need long time for calculation and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work artwork using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : get out the picture along glob@@ ular lines starting from a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ening a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by turning the pixels at a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ening of a rotating camera .
distances points : get the image to create a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to re@@ sign in the background .
movement : distor@@ ted the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photography , camera .
soft drawing : distor@@ ted the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos , or add a warm and subtle light .
sha@@ ker &apos;s sharp@@ ness : distor@@ ted the image through random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent inv@@ inci@@ dents : find the colour in the image and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the picture in rectangular cells and then created it through the filling with an average pix@@ el@@ value .
some effects need long time for calculation and create a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the kno@@ b button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . in this way , it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ur@@ in@@ proof algorith@@ ms .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of dri@@ ps to change . since the drop size is not automatically growing with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the drop and density of drops . fish eyes changes the effect of the drops on the picture .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ al ; image editing a range free of shelves . use the range of tools to stay free , for example , a face that should stay free . if you start the filters Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ping , the range will be free of shelves .
this is an example of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ping filters . the original sign ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the painted picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it by mirror or rotating in the proper orientation . the tools you will find in the menu transform@@ ers rotating and transform@@ ers .
it is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
to shr@@ ink a picture is easy . the big question is how can you inv@@ ent a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . choose transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for the size change uses a linear interface method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split pin inter@@ pol@@ ation for the enrich@@ ment of a picture . &amp; digi@@ al ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
keep the aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio is set in the original image aspect ratio .
rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter applies greater structures . the higher this value is placed , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ent effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and loading are used exactly . every single application for photo can be saved as text file and later re@@ loaded again .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see an example for photo over@@ h@@ ens by adding a little color on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also an often under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you need just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and tigh@@ tening of the rect@@ angle , create . you will see this rect@@ angle you see while mouse is moving .
when you start the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . so you can change a good overview like your photo after cutting . you can pull the size of the button by turning on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle you will create with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the section , use the kno@@ b button of image editing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File stores under the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the front area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned .
the tool is used to aspect ratio of aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ eters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
bottom in the dialog , you can set the Max . relationship button to cut the range on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , the settings stored on the aspect ratio ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the help of the support help allow hel@@ pers to create your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level , harmon@@ ic triangles are a way to divide a rect@@ angle in a harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden center : the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als leaves of a sunflower . it emerg@@ es in all possible things which we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your paintings , buildings and even photographs to give your creatures a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting particle is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that is usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you produce an image . these hel@@ pers are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third party , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual river .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles be used to lead the golden spiral . this can be a line of or different objects . this can be easily removed without the eye , it will fulfill his task .
the golden triangles are also derived from the top @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are not an equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to these lines can be appeared .
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame , you will create a effect of professional photographer dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information on the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t reach differently .
the options Horizont@@ al and vertical mir@@ ro@@ mir@@ ers can be used to mirror harmon@@ ious positions .
the button color allows you to set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ ary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you can &apos;t keep the camera ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things have turned around an angle . you can repair it with the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . select transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angles .
rotate your image with the firing angle . the default settings are set in degrees . with the default settings , you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above .
to help your help , the module requires a horizontal and vertical line to position . after you move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture to position the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after turning a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is the function transformation from processing of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut . select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing makes the image a bit after turning . note the above warning .
all per@@ emp@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out in a fixed point where reference point is carried out . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new heights : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle of degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle of degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle of degrees on the left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the picture becomes a little s@@ mu@@ c@@ eful . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve got the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to transfer this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image editing .
the tool tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and post@@ p@@ one another part in the opposite . this is no rotation , the image becomes distor@@ ted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module across transform@@ ers .
note your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you push it horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is built . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool button to adjust your image .
after you have done the proof@@ ing , the picture becomes a little bit wi@@ red . for a single shift , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible but two ch@@ asing is dou@@ bt@@ less so much s@@ wis@@ ely and so you should avoid this .
after the proof@@ ing , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a possibility to eliminate this is the image of transformation from the image editing .
&amp; digi@@ al ; you need to read and write a number of libraries and other par@@ c@@ els for image formats and , in some cases , from the type like this libraries comp@@ iling . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F .
digi@@ al &amp; digi@@ al ; shows only files to those who know . this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension is shown in the list . you can change this list of file extensions and digi@@ tization ; in section configuration , you will find more information about this .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select it even the format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ al ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression technique on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save free @-@ loss when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge read very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ mer Converter of &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
digi@@ al &amp; digi@@ al ; supports the store of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ . all supports cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ al ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often saved in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . however , this formats and is provided for movies . &amp; digi@@ al . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ al ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playback of movies use the program to playback the program .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four alignment with the module .
many tools you need to work in &amp; digi@@ al ; contain their description here .
all image processing tools like sharp@@ ening , soft@@ ness , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ frac@@ tures , un@@ sharp m@@ ating , &amp; etc ; use a uniform di@@ alog@@ ical type that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture applic@@ ator ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it five buttons allow the comparison chart of the pre @-@ acting command . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide ver@@ tically without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filters to the right of the selected pre @-@ looking division .
horizontal share without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower the filter is applied to the range below the selected curtain range .
split ver@@ tically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper section shows the original and the lower than the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when mouse is not in pre @-@ acting area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ and under@@ exposure . the colors used in the general installation page can be adjusted .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can draw this framework to the mouse within the picture and off part of the image from which you want to see a preview of the dialog is being updated instantly .
( 5 ) : in the left corner , here &apos;s a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all directions are provided by the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data , if these are available .
this rider makes an intuitive pl@@ otter tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and indicated . of course you will always find your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pall@@ ets and select colors .
the pall@@ ets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can either be installed for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colours .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets , or browse the folder .
the cur@@ sor will appear in the palm view as line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . colour is described under the palm view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to elect a choice , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , you move the mouse with crushed lin@@ ker mouse button .
if the cur@@ sor of cur@@ sor is inserted under the button color , the color is inserted in the cur@@ sor in the cur@@ sor . the color is selected either , or transmit another ; depending on whether the mode is selected . in this mode , you can adjust the check@@ box below the cur@@ sor over the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cut out and insert .
&amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a line @-@ end characters , if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , can be inserted as a color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the colour selection can be drawn using the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then select it on the left side .
&amp; ch@@ graph@@ er ; it is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alise Graph@@ ene . the programs that involves graph@@ s &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; the &amp; graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graphic viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of an integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :

further required software : &amp; graphic viewer ; it is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program which requires &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool and dot ; used for graph@@ s representation . in detail are needed :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub @-@ window . at first , if you start &amp; inter@@ iors , the main window is empty like in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool bar contains just the icon file and the ( empty ) list delivered files . click on the first icon to preview the dialog File .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; selected files , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the character &apos;s surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview , or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; graph@@ er ; loaded file from another program has been modified , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ loaded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; inter@@ iors ; can change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu option settings ; set up ... use , see also .
if you want to open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; file @-@ instance , &amp; eg ; in file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; instance or to file ad@@ mon@@ ing graph@@ s in a window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but this can be subsequently changed with the setup dialog .
when the program star@@ tup , you can re@@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also define how the graph is supposed to be split up to several sites . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
when you use several sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be set on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several sides distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the site again store gives the opportunity to determine the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ loading or to ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
to open the page , the option is to determine the behaviour of &amp; inter@@ cep@@ tions ; if a graph is opened outside a current session , you can open a default behavior ( the graph@@ s in a new window , or in a window of the current meeting ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site &apos;s seat management gives the possibility to determine the starting behaviour of &amp; inter@@ cep@@ tions ; you can define a default behavior ( open the files at the last session or not ) or determine at any start afterwards .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . entries as shown on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface may merge a number of selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the pictures you cor@@ related to the main window and call the menu on . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file , of course , data collected at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS track data are stored in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . use your camera zone here .
the devi@@ ation for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a upper devi@@ ation for the GPS period and camera eit . the devi@@ ation below is the data collected and the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have trace data from one place for images , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related all images in this range .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that the reality is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have done a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo .
the location can also be found with the displayed map by and to it . choose the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Guide this always through until you have a sufficient accuracy . the card can always be manually changed . the card can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of images using GPS data .

this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for HTML pages . character set will be encoded in UTF @-@ 8 to enable a possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to HTML . you will need to select these albums . the albums are not listed here . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text is displayed in the HTML page .
the rider look defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is extensively self explained . if you click on a picture , a new page will be displayed on each image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your associated images . select a folder made on which you write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
in case you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider views are allowed to give you some of the settings from the album rider for thum@@ b@@ nails , these are small pictures displayed in the gallery .
a progress window will show the user how far the action is . press off ab@@ rup@@ ting the process .
if the module has created the pages it is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program reports to determine if errors are performed during the production . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the preview of the gallery . press and close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or re@@ loc@@ ating . the viewer can be used with short commands and cou@@ ps . it has been designed for fast picture display and quick access to its features .
after the start , an image is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .

this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ i@@ v2 , to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG file module is a tool to convert a set of images into a MPEG video in form of m@@ asch@@ au .
the module MPEG co@@ di@@ ers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a basic screen size . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background colour for the slide . with this module it is possible to use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD to your DVD player . to burn the medicine , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG @-@ T@@ asch@@ au . then you can launch the module with ex@@ tras @-@ m@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected from you are then listed in the portfolio under image files . there you can also change sorting in the list or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . if you are planning a video format from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you must choose the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds displayed a picture . the vel@@ ocity of the image process is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . in doubt , you can set the name and path of the generated file under name of the m@@ peg file . keep the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , so this will be integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all settings of your computer , you can cook with the button below . depending on the speed of your computer , you can go quickly or in all silence to drink a coffee , and enjoy the thi@@ eves when you are back .
if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages above the right settings .
the print assistance is allowed to print several images on a sheet of paper , along with standard phot@@ og@@ ni@@ es . this can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert images stored in one of three formats , JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original look of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and restart the module . the Ra@@ w sculp@@ kon@@ verter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button , you can view the effect of your current settings .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white @-@ off . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue editing the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to allow double details . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
as soon as you are happy with preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results will be adjusted and only the extension is adjusted correspon@@ d@@ ingly . JPEG is used to use a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression power .
if you are often used to edit your images or later you should not use the JPEG format as it allows only a limited number of operations before setting up the image quality . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are well adapted to keep the original data .
in case you choose JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it .
the st@@ acker mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode therefore if you are sure , for example through testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the ability to automatically re@@ write the file automatically . this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt . however , this progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ com@@ press all images in an album . it uses the program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the image size reduction or enlarge . in addition , four types of image change will be provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option to adapt your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
printing preparations : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the pressure resolution and size of the photo set . the target picture , including background size , edge and background colour , is adjusted correspon@@ d@@ ingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of additional images in advance . more pictures can move to the list of expos@@ ing images and place there .
after you started the module , the pictures -@@ window with the displayed displayed by you are displayed . add more pictures to the selected image . for the last selected image , a preview on the right side is displayed .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of navig@@ ating images .
button images will be removed from the selected pictures from the list of the sent images .
after selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations regarding the size of sending e @-@ mails . it is perhaps a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time you use until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the comments of comments in an attached file , comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG file under the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image format , select the original files in JPEG format , then the original extru@@ dates will be added to the content displayed .
if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically to search for errors , see . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically by the end . with the kno@@ b , you can switch this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have presented your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose here between the selected and all the pictures of the album .
Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions in the presentation will use very elegant image monitoring via Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the distor@@ tion will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the file name of images in the left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can manually start at Es@@ c manually .
the option images randomly select that the pictures are shown in random order . so it will not be used the order of images in the album .
del@@ aying the pictures , the tim@@ ely distance between the pictures can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance is on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so , you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tional effects between those you can choose . randomly choose any other effect between the pictures .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool bar at the upper left screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch you .
with this tool@@ bar you can start and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
on the left @-@ hand side of the screen , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .

if you select all the characters , places and other settings , you can view images with thum@@ b@@ nails to view images of your occurr@@ ence .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; however , for every person a private look image , this is of course also true for locations , keywords and other categories that you own themselves . see the picture .
to display images in addition to the names , select the button which is located to the right position on the tool@@ bar . in the default context menu , you can select that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keyword ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images ) .
however , you need to set up the image for each single person . to do this , you need to open the image image window ( in a closer look ) , and select the image for the appropriate person . in the memory window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the picture shows and be cut or cut off .
if you are looking for entry in the main window , you will see a dialog displayed on the image for fixed image properties . this dialog can still be seen on the image again .
if you enter a string into the box lab@@ eling or description , the labelling or descriptions of images are searched for . if you wish , you can also enter a date , so for example , 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images in certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is shown to pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are displayed .
this is the user guide for &amp; photo@@ albums ; . if you do not like reading hand@@ books , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :

&amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; provided you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . integrated and the other as a module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user guide , the text is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; integrated version you can create via the HTML menu .
before HTML pages are created , you need to make some settings . these are split into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is explicitly described .
first , enter the title of the survi@@ ving and a description that is to contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ box ; HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; photo album will be created ; export file is to be seen on the over@@ sight page . nour@@ ishing information on the export files you will find in .
la@@ stly , you can select which information is shown on the HTML pages . so you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all pictures of a party are obvious . for example , all pictures are exported from a party . at the moment all images are exported . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the setup possibilities are unique , which is why this is not special received .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for images . thus , those who have a look at your site and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no more images download , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can be set up your pictures with a low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission rate . if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this installation area , you specify the different folder and URL where your website is stored .
best , select a base file for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location . this folder allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check that these really are all for viewing . if you choose a URL , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files are not yet available in the final destination file , you have to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , right , you must specify the final goal of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folder are located .
the only described options described are all three on base @-@ folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder is applied , whose name will define you in output file .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you can obviously create a HTML page for viewing the images . if you have already booked a lot of time for viewing the images , admission location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; photo@@ albums ; this work will not even be done .
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . these images are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in it whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of all images can be put together and this file can be so independent . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file seeks the images in tw@@ o@@ fold ways . first , the images are not found , so the images of the URL , which you have indicated in creating the HTML files , is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file via HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for Export Import images , which you can export via the File menu .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three options available to you :
in the Manu@@ ally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option , copy &amp; copy the .@@ k@@ im file directly to the .@@ k@@ im file ; images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not able to compressed the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is limited to maximum image size . if you are sending to your friends pictures , the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size , by example , that each image is supposed to be 800 pixel wide and wide .
if you use a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu import ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; the exported database , as described in .
the assistant to imports is made of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folders will be copied to import images .
it can be that you will person@@ alise the category persons of the import file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog , which is to import the categories of imported file and which categories contain these in your database .
in the fourth step , you can use the categories of imported file to the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture below .
it must be easy to browse and watch images : if you see images , you want to see images within different sequence groups &amp; md@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you may want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) fixed information about your images , via ( 2 ) look through and look through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ability .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was begun as a program for managing your images . it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently , this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; records all of the information stored in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top file of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions of the CV@@ S , wherever they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; re@@ members the folder made in which your images are stored and use them automatically . if you want to read a different folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo album -@@ c ~ / company / photos / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry Settings ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo album ; in the following section of the user guide you will see the various setup possibilities .
to the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to call setup possibilities and options for the viewer . for each adjustment there is a detailed help available , which you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option .
in it was described to you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
in view of the dialog , which is used to process existing groups already . for each existing group you can choose a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog , you can set complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in one group instead of all groups of a Medi@@ gli@@ eds as explained .
in view of the setup possibilities , you can choose to set the list of members to set up . in the top box list , you can select the category you would like to configure . in the left window of window , a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ Album ; shares his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and g@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin interface . nour@@ ishing information on this site can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; however , most modules have a help @-@ page that you can call on the modules itself .
since the modules of multiple applications are used together , it can be that modules with &amp; photo@@ albums ; only very little tested on your own pictures , before you call them on your own pictures using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . don &apos;t say that I would not have been warned !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the largest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that include K@@ IP@@ I , is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; this kind of order is not supported , simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo album ; can be used .
simul@@ ated &amp; photo album simul@@ ates &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , shows all images that show you the picture preview .
in addition to the current album &amp; photo album has to record a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; col@@ photo@@ albums ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be used as the category you have set in the dialog box as a Category for Virtual records . for example , if you use the category characters , you will have &amp; photo album ; so do so if you would have chosen people to view and continue the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove these modules from the modules . start the installation dialog and choose the modules that modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you can start your photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see the top of a menu and one tool bar . currently , it contains no more information about your pictures , as you can &apos;t have any information about your pictures . in the section you will display on this window , but just click on the entry pictures that shows you an overview of all the available pictures .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; is the ability to see each image with notes , where the picture has been taken on the picture , where the picture has been taken separately or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously . if , for example , to all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see this notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by typ@@ ing people , locations and keywords . they are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ albums ; as you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the shift of pictures within the list below : if you have a family party for example , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , by doing so the names used to be moved up and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to receive a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the symbol for sorting on the list below .
if you select notes on each image , you may wish to edit all selected images and have this pictures with notes . click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then you can be more comfortable to mark all these images and select the menu option of multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . in order to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol will be displayed .
in the context menu of the package , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also move an entry to a category of existing or sub@@ category to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see also .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the dialog by adding the bodies which the upper edges of the frame form , click and move . you can also make your own windows by setting it out of the window range .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current setup and the appearance of the window .
you can also send a frame completely . if you wish to receive this window later , use the button options ... and here window a / out . see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have any filters . here , you can see the size of the thum@@ b@@ nails , by simply after getting the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you f@@ use a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have no window opened with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removing button or select the menu Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures stored on your hard disk . of course , you have to store the pictures anywhere , so you can store the pictures anywhere in the database . in the picture you can view the view from &amp; photo album ; if not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded .
pictures where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thum@@ b@@ nails are present , so &amp; photo album ; you can &apos;t see these images with the picture viewer .
as you need to see , you need to copy files from folders and copying files . &amp; photo album ; if you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the question in question . if so , you can &apos;t want to avoid any damage to your pictures , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it .
in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , select the pictures so that you can see for other un@@ accessible . alternatively , you can also see all images that can see your little sister , control and select everything except for current view .
so you have specified what pictures will be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry . if you want to get locked out , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into unlock images . to set this password , simply select password change in the menu .
please consider that this picture protection is not very safe . for one , all the pictures can be found on the hard disk and to the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves that those who are with &amp; photo album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images .
the reason why you want to manage all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; of course you can spend them at some time . of this reason , you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; photo album has a photo _ and video viewer . these can be seen from the preview , as described in .
the viewer you can see in . it is of course the picture , but additional all the information you enter via the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the top part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag them by mouse and if any information is indicated . all these options are displayed following a right click on the viewer . all these options are shown below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this web browser , see right entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
in case you have several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and back up by using the buttons image high and end up . you can jump on the first and final picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also achiev@@ able from the context menu .
if several pictures are uploaded in the viewer , you can run them as a di@@ asch@@ au . as frequently there is a new picture load after a few seconds . as frequently there is a new image , you can press the tr@@ l button and plus or minus . then the distor@@ tion is stopped by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of viewing &amp; photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the picture , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the min@@ us key , you can zoom back out The Plus button in the middle of the picture . shows how a Zoom rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point @-@ button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the th@@ read@@ iness puts the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equal to the image of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos that come in and out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ sta@@ ste .
with the set functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes about the actual picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you see images , you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment you can view the view and enter configuration dialog for the image to view this name . however , you will perhaps take the image only to mark and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and view them as good or bad , while you look one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer indicates the possibility of paint images with features , while you see them . features are the letters A to Z and you can select a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in view , see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features to your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the fore@@ seen view . if you add the categories in DR@@ E preview , then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the characteristic after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you &amp; photo album ; paint on the picture .
the original is not stored in the image , but in the database . on the way you can reverse your fore@@ old later .
in you can view a picture on the painted picture . in order to complete the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; select the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting you just press the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
in order to work with &amp; caps , you have to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully domin@@ ate but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should necessarily read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then , their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the subject of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be built , so that you can choose the correct position :
with delete either from the menu bar , edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified properties , click on Apply to take these changes . if you have valid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can report the input checks and res@@ ume the changes to ab@@ rupt .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in set @-@ up dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL users to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you process a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ economic view .
press a preview of the character tab and a small example of the scene is described with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is described , even if you want to ren@@ dering a texture within a texture @-@ map and not the entire texture @-@ map ) , you cross locally .
the screenshot of the camera shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rot@@ ting as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window .
every object has a wire level as an wire level . you can only specify that value relatively to the level of the higher property or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level , smaller or equal to the tool chosen of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object characteristics are displayed left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window window , or if you need a different arrangement , you can store it any more window direc@@ tives and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the stamp to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the stamp to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red at the right or left side of this view , and extends across the height .
if you want to arrange multiple views , drag the stamp in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views through clicking on the card keys in the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the vertical window , drag the stamp to the Desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the arrow bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade panel . to prevent the closing , click on the little square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can em@@ it them on any location .
the current window view allows you to save ... save . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the window order under a existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program must be correctly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 new . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the symbol ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool bar or select the menu entry view scene .
an R@@ ender mode corresponds the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can combine any number of r@@ ender modes , from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality .
if you click on the icon or select the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar or select the R@@ ender modes menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size , you can apply the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the section section and specify the image section to ren@@ dering the input fields .
in the combination of quality , you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflec@@ tions lighting . an exhaus@@ tive description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different mistakes can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in ben@@ ds and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are in the representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures featuring this property look better .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and bin@@ ds to P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adap@@ tive , and adap@@ tive because each Pix@@ els depend on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam down pixel . if the difference between the color values will exceed the pre @-@ given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a specific additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be added additional R@@ ays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 R@@ ays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , which will be further pursued and further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of rec@@ ur@@ sion can be adjusted with the low value .
another possibility to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of space for beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to prevent regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long way to calculate an scene with this property .
on this map card , you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object taken .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console edition . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file , select the menu entry ... and select a file in the dialogue window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers support ; yet not the full command of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window is showing a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ v@@ modeling ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code in the editor &apos;s text file . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag him into the object tree .
copying and insert in &amp; caps in &amp; caps , and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called upon when &amp; cr@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; a scene is ren@@ dering . usually this is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
if you click on the help in the original file , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; die &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place here the path to your document re@@ ten@@ tion and version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ ine data ) in the pa@@ ws to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also apply the path to these files here . if a file is present in different patches of the library , the first file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type distingu@@ ishing marks .
you can set the object by@@ catch of points on the button &quot; button on the wire model &quot; button . you can adjust the grid separate for shifts , sc@@ aling , and speeds .
larger values add a more accurate wire model , thus creating a better look for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects , such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed press for two directions .
if you cross high detailed information for extended projections , all the wire model views are further removed if the camera uses an extended projection . the projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box with two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered . the ground will be displayed in a box with two adjustable colors .
if you are able to activate edge lenses , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . accurate information about parameters in the section called R@@ ender @-@ modes .
this page allows you to create existing window frames or create new window frames . in section window direc@@ tives , it is declared as you can create window direc@@ tives .
the combination field standard window order : shows all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of prec@@ urs@@ or window direc@@ tives shows all existing window frames . a new arrangement can add you to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below illustrates all views on the chosen window order . new views can add you with the button adding and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ locks , you get the window under the existing window , with card card , you can &apos;t list a map view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate way to create simple scene under beginners : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully notice the following war@@ nings , before you get compl@@ aining that you will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , please note these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , you can &apos;t use any rules for ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; the following default window order form :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an adequate performance of what you can expect from this program .
you will often need to use these menus and icons now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , as well as their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and select the menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) , this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows the result of the ren@@ dering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the object characteristics , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find more details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but notice that the camera is in view of control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on the left button and drag him to the desired place .
if you press the button or press the button , the wire model views and object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could set a cube ( insert end@@ able body qu@@ ader ) and size at x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ulative method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; indeed , offers a simple way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name , and then press the button , or the command aste . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the plane , though at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics .
in this scene , you should move to the floor into exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
first , choose the soil to set his material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something cat@@ ches in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box that you can select as the object should be inserted . you can change the name in the object tree . you can change the name in the inher@@ ent view ( name = Ground Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course the pig@@ ments depic@@ ts only a mat black material because you can still use settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way .
if you don &apos;t see in preview no color on the cube and the ball , click on the button and then click on the button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you run your picture with a click on the symbol , you should obtain the following result :
of course , you are not able to enter the colors . here you need to set two new attributes . in the object tree you need to do the entry color list . then , select this entry twice ( you can also do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ord colour list may only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree every time , select the colors in the object of the object characteristics :
this step , you should already be able to run , as you model the basic work mode of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; you should already have understood that the ball is just as easy as to create the ground :
in the object characteristics of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : at 1 ( do not forget the input , or push the button to press ) so that the ball would float above the ground , as you post@@ pon@@ ed the ground about a unit down@@ wards .
of course , the ren@@ dering yields a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface like a mat black material appears . place in the following step a suitable material .
when you choose the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as in the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
choose First sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , then select In@@ color and set the values as follows :
but you can reach most interesting effects if you take the time , some finish features include :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already yiel@@ ded good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; offer . hopefully you have learned much , you can easily create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ ra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical radi@@ ance from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects may appear in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the nebul@@ a . thus , the scene is set to pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , without a camera you can see nothing , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be en@@ acted , some light sources and at least one camera .
the usual file dialog can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that model@@ ed you with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; created
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have stored the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
rest@@ oring the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
you can only select this menu entry , if you are not yet stored in the scene yet .
repeat the last reset . this menu entry allows you to only select if you have used editing .
records the current window order and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ elop@@ es . , here you can change the look , the keys and the default behavior .
opens a dialogue to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can model default correctly with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sk@@ er ; -@@ instructions change or add new .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . you can model and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ kin models ; add commands and remove them .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is an option to produce rough surfaces , without any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file either for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture @-@ map .
basic sets are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies . these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look .
a texture @-@ map is an option to give the surface of an object colour on pixel base , using an image file as a colour card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and web browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in a specific window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files , which you can display with click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key Return .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in a specific window , or whether all images are always using the same window .
if you &apos;re looking for a specific file , simply tap the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then appears a small input field in the right corner . if a password file is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing the return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue setting - &amp; ball show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , general and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the mode of &amp; ball show ; in the two other , short @-@ commands for the display window and short order for the browser , the key formula can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to display the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour that you can continue below . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loading &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow .
this option saves &amp; ball show ; when you opened the name of the last opened folder . in the next star@@ tup , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show opens ; these folders in the browser window .
click on the coloured beams to select a background colour . it is used to fill the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected colour .
you can make &amp; ball show ; make sure that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option will be extended to display the display window on the full screen . this option is turned on as default .
specify if the sli@@ deshow starts with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the picture changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if set is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated so long until they change the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the key figures for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card pack short commands for the display window and short order for your browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part list of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short delivery .
shows small icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short delivery .
shows thum@@ b@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short delivery .
resi@@ dual the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the picture increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
the image is shown in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the digi@@ plug ; project .

the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of &amp; show photo ; to set up on these settings , you have to change in menu settings list ; you can switch between these settings by pressing the symbols on the left side .
in the exposure of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed if the lower or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you are to view . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposed a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to selected images . you can also find this page bar where you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more power than images and en@@ rich .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple use of scan images that do not make more as pictures to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for any picture a dialog for saving or save the pictures instantly in a specified file with automatically generated names and format . users can also save the images from the store .
you can check the status of your scanner in the s@@ ane project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog can choose a selection of the scanner .
the user can select the use of the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . break down &amp; remove sc@@ roll@@ ers .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
to can@@ st a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ ju@@ can and then scan an scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started through the preview button .
to select the picture better , the user can also zoom in the picture and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the picture has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you want to view a preview in the settings , the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when storing is pressed , then the image is stored and there &apos;s a break @-@ down and you get back into the main window .
the button settings will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can choose the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before storing a preview . if this preview of user is not desired , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures store up . dialog for each image opens the dialog before each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite opens the dialog before each one @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite opens up automatically with a generated names in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you must select store without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images should be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after any scan , this folder will be used as a standard for the save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for the image automatically added to the image and is additionally the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the image automatically stored a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time is recorded if a picture is saved . the character string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value while storing . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button provides the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end up &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; be used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; am@@ ble ; uses one list of these pump@@ kin kind . below you can set up a list of these pump@@ kin and its function . you can set up a list of these pump@@ kin and set the global button closure , set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... Select .
you may need to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as a &amp; am@@ ble ; -@@ dum@@ b@@ ulation work . in this way , you make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ ble ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list and scripts ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script may not be implemented due to a lack of depend@@ ance . please check in your script , whether all the modules are available and use the dialog , so the user interface , why a script does not run .
Beg@@ in &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; hold Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or use it simply to expand the necessary functions . you will quickly find out that the script of scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ COP can exchange your scripts data with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each K@@ DE installation should be attached .
most scrip@@ ting languages allows to execute external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be easily accessed . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ ble ; messages noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts to monitor the default entry of script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react appropri@@ ately to events . of course , a script should ignore the events if there is no use of it .
configure We@@ ert the script to indicate the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work folder on the folder , where all data should be saved .
tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is played . the script is now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions ask for more information on the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) .
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : contains a user @-@ defined menu entry . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Title are also given , so that the script can identify its own entry . to remove the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p Am@@ arok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove a post again , one can use d@@ co@@ p Am@@ arok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok branches off ; or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ ble ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M will be done to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optionally available with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be seen clearly as Amar@@ il@@ o.@@ k@@ ins@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 with the user .
&amp; am@@ ble ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ an script . for this reason , you should get your script packages correctly .
the main character must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can go up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang on the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; am@@ arok . for your entry on K@@ DE apps you should use the Brow@@ se category ; scripts should use .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio @-@ player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; am@@ eda ; has many useful and powerful functions and yet is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ ble ; you can easily go through the play@@ list instead of going through endless menus . perhaps you can only look for a very specific titles from thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ ble ; &apos; s Collec@@ tors Browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never choose which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists web browser is just right for you . and if you choose the decision , the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists select the right music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ I@@ i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ use your music !
usually , you need to enter the following results in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ eda ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ akers were used to comp@@ ile any problems . if you encounter any problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ ble ; as most applications , has some options to activate or dis@@ able the configure script using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activated de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you wish to help in the development of &amp; am@@ anos , you should be full .
&amp; am@@ arok ; can be set up without trouble via set @-@ setting dialog . the set @-@ up dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok .
player window viewing the player window in addition to the play@@ list , respectively . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window is specified .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ ble ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar was compiled . this option switches to the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
easy to design : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ ble ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . this means that the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer is modified .
m@@ oods files for the music files : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ ble ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder by &amp; am@@ Bella ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / / am@@ ble / m@@ ood@@ bar ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; am@@ pling ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other Brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list .
play@@ list when storing , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; am@@ arok . please enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose your current play@@ list when you want to lose .
relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , you &apos;ll use &amp; am@@ ble ; relative paths to the music files starting from the play@@ site of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up current pieces of play , make sure that the play@@ lists windows are up / roll@@ out to keep the running piece always in the visible window frame .
in contrast to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next one is played .
in the section of the appearance you can custom@@ ize &amp; am@@ ble ; the section is included in three parts .
in the font section , you can choose the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ ble ; otherwise , you can select scripts for the following range : play@@ lists window , player windows , and context @-@ browser . press on selecting ... , so you can select a select font from the selection dialog .
with the set of user @-@ defined color scheme , you own the Qu@@ al of choice and can define a special colour scheme . use the paint sel@@ ectable paint choice for front and background colour .
playback at the start continues , that &amp; am@@ iss ; after the program release , will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at last end .
the panel on @-@ screen display allows you to display an on @-@ screen display . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog box font for O@@ SD . the check@@ box shade causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colors offer you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colours are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used .
the input field display text illustrates the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so , you can choose which screen will be a multi @-@ channel monitor setting the O@@ SD .
the Audio output card allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable you to activate additional settings in this card card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ ble ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , select the check@@ box in addition to its name . this section also includes connectors on how to proceed with the selected folders .
browse the sub@@ folder as well : this causes &amp; am@@ ble ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder will be searched for .
alter@@ ations : enables &amp; am@@ ble ; to monitor the selected file to changes ( e.g. music files added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to be able to make the necessary changes to your collection .
re @-@ play@@ lists : causes it to add that &amp; am@@ ble ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection , then added to the play@@ lists later in the play@@ lists .
the Collec@@ tors database is used for selecting a database for the collection . the combination field driver : can you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , you will need to setup a further setup in the MySQL server .
the MySQL server is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ ble . under calcul@@ ator : the computer database is entered . afterwards , below port : the network port is entered , under which the database is achiev@@ able . name : is the database name , which is established in conjunction with the database .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data you need to be used for the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ ble ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create with need of music @-@ recommendations regarding the current piece .
here , enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send bott@@ ling pieces and update the profile : this setting allows you to transfer it &amp; am@@ ble ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ iss ; a list of similar perform@@ ers to the each played play . note : you can view the list in context @-@ browser . note : you need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ ble ; is an audio @-@ player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise don &apos;t need any other K@@ DE packages . you have to have installed k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained , because &amp; am@@ ble ; you need some of them to be compiled modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to deal k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD set in advance that your window managers allow the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . for example , we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files can make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can review the file by using in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / h@@ ill@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang out the broken file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again .
most of them is that Tag@@ li@@ b read the met@@ a info from this file . please tell these errors to the conference Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ pling ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of us compiled by &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; am@@ ble ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b has been compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate your machine . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .

this is because many programs write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but they do not describe as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

after the start of &amp; am@@ ame ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start window was converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of these icons have changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the evaluation by the user , while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column review . click somewhere in the new application column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also read the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove , and then press cre@@ f on your keyboard . or click on your selection and then select from the list of play@@ list from the drop down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )

the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you must have to give another rop@@ ping ( such as oss@@ sink ) .
that does &amp; am@@ ble ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can go directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings from Arts . open sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ity ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ch@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is adjusted :

either you don &apos;t use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to obtain faster quot@@ as ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
presumably , use the Arts drivers . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less orders react to visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es , crash@@ es , and off . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . do the regi@@ stran@@ t register to record all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module file from G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run them again . now you will start &amp; am@@ ble .

if you want to search for a piece , which contains a particular search term , set a minus sign before the search term : - something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these synthesis variants according to exposure . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .

the administration of waiting long will open all over the queu@@ e management . if you would like to add a piece in the play@@ list , then click + . you can also add the pieces to the mouse or the context menu in the play@@ list . you can then change the order of pieces in the queu@@ e management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( details about the establishment of this follow later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection , and add another random pieces while playing .
insert pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you will need no last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic play@@ list works .
double click on the desired play@@ list , drag them to the play@@ list window , or click on the right button . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list so you should store the old play@@ list so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ configured modes acci@@ dental mix and play@@ lists mix immediately complete your play@@ list and you must add at least one piece themselves from your collection . the recommended pieces will each be added to the next batch , therefore your play@@ list will be filled until the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the latest play@@ list , turn the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will be your existing play@@ list as a starting point . via the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again .
the button new fill the current play@@ list and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialogue to edit the play@@ list and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to click Edit . subsequently , the dialog to edit settings of the play@@ list .
enter any name for play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will be extended continuously , the setting for future plays will be over@@ taken , and they will be able to double in this play@@ list . if the employment is active , the already played pieces will be removed under observation of the play@@ mate .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces being kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . therefore , you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added after each played piece to play@@ list . if you set here more than 1 , then the play@@ list is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side were already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialogue , you can already cross existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ iss will be added , random pieces from each of the requested play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adjust the settings by clicking the script and then click on setting .
you can install new &amp; am@@ ble ; scripts will install on the script file . once you have installed a script dialog , you can install a new entry in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script which will then click on .
if you are looking for information on writing , please refer to the letter writing by scripts .
the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ plug@@ ins dialog is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok . Windows contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check@@ box beside the name .
these quick instructions will show you how to create with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps create an audio CD . in order to complete the steps you have to follow a l@@ ashing installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , remember how high the bit rate is received , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a low @-@ loss format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
these quick instructions will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you will have a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps below , you have to have a l@@ ord@@ able installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have inserted the Qu@@ ell CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
for copying a data CD , please select Extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings are done , please press the button button . you can now see a dialog like this or something like :
in this dialogue window you can track the progress of the copy process . once the original text is done into the image file , you will be asked about an empty CD @-@ medium to run the data .

cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for retri@@ eving digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . these programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio co@@ dation and for handling with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio @-@ layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
lame : a far developed MP3 Decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . lame is used by the MP3 Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder @-@ module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ ni@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files afterwards to a audio CD . de@@ co

V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a full @-@ featured car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ zer : this tool is used to adapt the volume of music files to a standard level . it can be useful for creating smart CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without Nor@@ mali@@ ze you can lead the different entrance examination of the various albums at the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and play automatically all the videos on the recording folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . click on an entry to open the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is requested after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog stores under will be displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
stores all open projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what will happen . you can then choose between stores and changes . furthermore , you can also break the shut@@ down and open the project as usual .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every non @-@ stored project , what should happen to happen , just as would you have called for each project file .
includes all open projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for every non @-@ stored project , what should be done so as if you had called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the files directly from the top view into the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialogue &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . to the burning of the media . the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above what is this ? -@@ help is described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only be used for an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD Project . it is useful when you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you to see the files available on the medium already available files and folders .
this entry will only display at an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files will not remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the imported files again .
opens the CD @-@ copy @-@ dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a image from a CD , which you can then burn sometime later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy @-@ dialog . this enables even without project file copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only use a DVD using a DVD using the copy of a DVD using the copy of a DVD using the copy @-@ dialog , therefore the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW drive . you can delete all the content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
opens the dialogue to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the contents to be deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes and incre@@ ment@@ ary .
the dialog is burning after an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g -@@ files are currently not supported , so you must use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously developed DVD screen . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pushing the burning button .
a previously exclusive DVD video can be converted . this dialog box appears normally according to the output of a DVD in the content view , but can also be used separately . it contains information on the generated video , code settings and even options to change the size and cut off black ra@@ ils .
shows information about the inserted tape . this information is shown in the content view and include properties of media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if one entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar currently is visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small gro@@ ste is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not appropriate , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or off . folder view also contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , the content will also appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , lock and unlock the drive or dis@@ card of the medium .
switches with the content view or off . the content view allows you to select and set pulling files into the project view . the content view is also an interface for displaying audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view .
to@@ ggle the head@@ bar in the projection view or off . the head@@ bar is a narrow area that &apos;s only visible when the projection screens has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens up a dialogue window to modify the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order further below .
this starts k@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assistance systems . thus , correct per@@ missions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator when you start the wi@@ zard ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general settings can be done . nearly all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on an@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is designed to person@@ alise and encourage the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; also , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the scope of functions , therefore rather your taste and the type of task is crucial to give you the attached tools .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following in the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common all &amp; K@@ DE ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and additional functions to create new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id Re@@ f cre@@ at@@ e@@ D@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ v ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ v ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternative to create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b features the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string ) Vo@@ id Pad@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ) ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ren@@ ame It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id set@@ te@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
so it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT sc@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT sc@@ at@@ e@@ according / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the machine installed .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for example read &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and of many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , which are encoded using these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ free compression ) . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) com@@ presses to the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ dings are already available , so it is highly likely to be installed for any Linux distribution . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages are installed , which are needed . if the FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not necessary .
which co@@ di@@ er@@ pillar / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Co@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and com@@ pressing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for retri@@ eving the protection , it is not possible to avoid any copy protection . in any case &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , it is not possible to avoid the copy of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copying protected audio CDs ; s !
while setting it only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration may be found until a suitable configuration may be found . this leads ( hopefully ) to comprehen@@ sion for the sl@@ ender approach to the user interface , which will often be stum@@ bled on the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which the programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; you can get information from free@@ DB from the Internet or can operate completely without the network , everything is manually collected .
this is only a brief list of commands of the main source . on the page step , you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program maps for the program configuration .
the CD@@ DB starts on request of the CD @-@ data according to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet . )
start reading and - if a en@@ coder is configured in the Settings tab for setup software - the coding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the option can be read with another en@@ coder than the standard . it is to be aware that the en@@ coder is configured in setup settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , allowing a file to en@@ code a file instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programme events ( like reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main set @-@ up dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with various credit cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . hi@@ ther you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ coder and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ key &apos; , which may possibly be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats , which lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at low bit rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both the co@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame will still be included with most distri@@ butions of distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit rate ) but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rate .
OGG - if only music is supposed to be heard from one computer or a host @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play equipment is present .
MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and the compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = These setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical ideas acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of teenagers , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ ographic systems . but not good enough for better stereo audio systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set st@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolute highest quality without view of the file size , then choose this attitude .
die &amp; CD ; information , which are manually entered or replaced by the program automatically from the free@@ DB file , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the code program for creating the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switch to these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; Title of the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; added . the result looks as follows : &apos; -@@ d { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button number in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can download the information up / enter the information , so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the machine : &amp; CD ; Title , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the user : this is the author of the author ) . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is also the information without the music business damage . all information can be obtained via a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , can be obtained .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active an address box ( sending an address ) . for use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counterfeit ) address used in the system . in this sort of configuration , it appears that the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from server ( This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; used to use free@@ DB , the geographical work@@ load should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of Spiegel@@ servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually posted monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which elite program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... It was always the best choice for the evaluation of audio CDs ; see also that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed first , if this is not done yet .
to save the exclusive WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the opening , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab@@ by . other Ko@@ en@@ erer can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package needs to be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined Ko@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ en@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er , further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of an command as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . verify the setup of the device number of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to call both programs with a command line in one terminal . that might indicate what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell &amp; CD . this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this may be tips how to proceed .
have you read the whole manual , understood everything , but are somehow still uncertain as to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , do everything setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
it must be installed cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , a suitable package for lame can be found as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , of course you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to copy it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something probably will be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for each exclusive &amp; CD ; it must be repeated .
here we determine the using co@@ di@@ ers for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the free@@ DB file to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any &amp; CD , if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device number is handed over to the evaluation program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General Settings . there is no much to do here . here an additional conversion is defined . in our example , everything will be ignored / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only select with incomplete information , so that you will be informed when data are displayed in keyword ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD file automatically download on the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the activation of the &amp; CD , so that it can be connected to the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD file is found . it is associated with low risk , if you are later un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame and file names can be easily changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , if you want to manually use everything manually , you can download the select boxes and free@@ DB file . however , this is worth $ 620 MB in offline mode , you will need to be selected if this is worthwhile . in order to use free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two selection has to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is free@@ zed for us . these are settings for the data en@@ quiry , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . place everything as shown in the screenshot .
mode : we do not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both have to work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls manipul@@ ate the protocol 88@@ 80 standard@@ ly , there is perhaps more fortun@@ ate with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit an &amp; CD ; data on the free@@ DB server . the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time in just an existing drive ? of parallel reading and en@@ code ? the author knows not to try them .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross it to the &amp; CD ; to dis@@ card the end of the process .
user @-@ defined files for temporary files : if you &apos;re heading up this , then / must the path / folder will be displayed if only space is connected to another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will not be uploaded when you want to do something with the WAV files .
everything will enter as it is on the screenshot . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances it needs to be blind@@ ed to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags , in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the command file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is , we just have the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
this section is described as the process of selecting the &amp; CD ; on the hard drive , we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is installed , as we are convenient and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB can be fet@@ ched . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each exclusive &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screen photos will see a little different from than the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD , instead of sending them out of the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not attempt to find out the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , like in the screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , you will seek questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been collected successfully from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window embedded , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not select the check@@ box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can manually loose this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have any local database , but take the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor -@@ entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of input field &apos; Update Title &apos; , the rest of the data in an input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must not be entered in an input field &apos; up@@ dating title &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments as a single piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful recall of the data from the free@@ DB file the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to test the content of the CD editor , so you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red notes .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album , and titles of a piece and only 28 signs for the comment field . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least for which &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed , take a look at the tab &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags will not be supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help to the Ko@@ en@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the exclusive CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD yet . for more information please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the specified data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . be the title of the piece on any case and other information they wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you downloaded from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece a or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection process reading process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message you will see if you are attempting to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have writing access to the files for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the balance .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , check out and en@@ code in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and en@@ code . in high @-@ performance machines , the calcul@@ ator with an am@@ d@@ 64 appears to have no problem when simultaneously reading and en@@ code ( of course , two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is coded for a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message appears at the top left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to produce compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the co@@ di@@ ers of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; however , it is provided within the K@@ DE ; CV@@ S is part of the k@@ icking multimedia package . however , you can find an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package is a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; if you read this , you probably have done it ...
this section is directed to people compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to suit your needs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . at best , read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , ever @-@ read yet ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked off the program Start as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
who reads it ? who reads this , has probably started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can do not count this manual . it is thought as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; may it be . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has adopted this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange when it has managed to get the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others , he has not yet have some properties that do not have real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound projection drivers , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing colour , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can pull in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; constellation ; window on K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid controls automatically the method used .
seat support . if you stop &amp; K@@ DE ; during the recording of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song .
you can also have a file from a &amp; s@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window fall . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and run the button du@@ ck in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play@@ through from the menu pieces or create the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will start automatically once you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then recorded after@@ ward . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the kno@@ b .
if you find a song too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the speed display and so the billing speed can change . in order to reg@@ ain the original pace , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , does a print on the button pause , or select the menu entry in the menu , so it breaks the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text @-@ event , others use lyrics and another . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically identified , allowing you to set anything manually . if you select anything manually , you will automatically have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these are played in the series after . in this section , how you can use the collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collector manager . in the menu Collection , click here . click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then define the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the right to the collector manager .
in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . don &apos;t worry if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to add a song to the project manager . once you can add a song , you can again select the File dialog , with the help you select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic settings to the collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using File opening or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection , the collection is activated , activated , and it will be activated , then the collection will continue to be opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collector manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing .
you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played . if you select the series from the menu selection sequence of the menus , the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be set .
to play a song , select it to the manager manager , or use the select list on the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the arrow on the right .
in order to jump back a song , select the kno@@ b button , the entry of previous pieces from the menu , or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collector manager , choose to delete the collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be er@@ ased . however , that doesn &apos;t matter , since it is not stored at leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events translated into events that understands syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of the Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in the events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always gives a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all the sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all the necessary adjustments for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may seem as often as desired . for this purpose , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the keyboard &quot; ... End Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A new Key@@ map ... &quot; End Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and end that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order nor line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the sounds on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun type . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( en@@ forcing ) , patch 100 ( the drum at your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which is the sound in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , in which each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means the sound level of the always equal drum ( such as some keyboards own ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify such sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used primarily to make sounds on the Per@@ k@@ screen channel . look at the supplied keyboard maps .
this section can be used to exchange some channels to others . if you want to change some channels for the first and the second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is part of the channel that is depicted on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyboard must be specified in the file name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option may be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ screen patch on the Per@@ k@@ screen channel .
the value for pitch assignment indicates in which relationship pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if so , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event , then it will be re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then will be for@@ warded to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , so that the Map file doesn &apos;t include a dec@@ imal ( Map file ) .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some keyboards to play two sounds up to an oc@@ tave above . in order to try the right value on your keyboard , you need a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI settings . in the menu , you will find the MIDI settings stored in the Settings menu .
the canal view is a window with a whole number of piano ( one for any MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ ws you can see which sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have modified a tool , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view in menu settings under the Point canal view : settings
the temp@@ o @-@ LCD shows the speed , played with a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows on left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
good , I can force not force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have the control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ aries ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid . this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from K@@ mid ; &apos;s Home )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agreed , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
if you necessarily need to add automatic settings to the collection , otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can get the arrow button on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI @-@ folders and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way , I want to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a MIDI file or I would like to play a file , merely go to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; change window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; prefer .
if you would like to listen to a file only once you want to add in to a collection , switch the automatic settings to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . you only want to play the first file only . so , set the automatic settings to collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly these a MIDI file .
then join in B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , animated me to program &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , I try not to take a little time for my hobbies , but I try to collect MIDI files , making music and prove phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or propor@@ tionally @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really don &apos;t want to send me a huge anticip@@ ation , if you send me a postcard from your home or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you would like to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you would like to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and don &apos;t eman@@ ate money for that . I would therefore empha@@ size that I will only start re@@ program , because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

the window window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is shown in it .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections below the Book@@ mark , but these are single entries . if you would like to create a list of entries that use after each other , you should use the Permanent play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you p@@ anc@@ é one entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category , and playback will start with the modified entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list may also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this by editing , but also through the application itself . in addition , the various files in directory , choose from the menu view and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML contents will appear on this part .
after changing XML files , select play@@ list must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when editing mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the author &apos;s convenience of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .

the starting animation does not need to be short , it is automatically finished by opening another source . this would be trou@@ bl@@ esome at the end @-@ animation , but the user can therefore quit the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ works ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / etc ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / ; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are listed in the tests / some examples of S@@ MIL die from &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported .
there is a rider for configur@@ ing m@@ player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path of the M@@ Player and the intermediate storage size can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured to manually edit the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ fully , such as the setting of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field of em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player device must be specified as service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the configuration dialog ( K@@ DE ) .
the quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages on the store of the browser library . if no error occurs , the back@@ end edition within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type is removed ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV channels can be viewed , the scanner should be configured to use device and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data rec@@ orders ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be ports to be selected ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it .
since V@@ DR can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video is also supported ( probably this kind of recording video devices under Linux ) is supported . for this reason the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to be functioning properly . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be functioning in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally they are used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , ex@@ positions , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ ex@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there not@@ ices like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive easier when I play from it ( not from VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the root user to run the device as a user . it is absolutely safe to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last stored value , only the first time will check x@@ ine the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; needed .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional cycl@@ ist application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably use the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled pack@@ ets of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website .
if you have any questions or for the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are expan@@ sions requested , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this simple , immediate and tail@@ or @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; options . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wi@@ zard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to experience the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with the reading of chapter &amp; Kate .
for lat@@ ex ; the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH . it is easy to use and is also a La@@ ie ( English L@@ ay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros may be used . a less sophisticated but more realistic view is that it is from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given here , it is not the ultimate book . to have &amp; lat@@ ex ; right to k@@ icking , there should be good b@@ aker , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
as well as other drawing languages , &amp; lat@@ ex contains ; an introduction to which the common properties such as paper format , side circulation and text gr@@ inder will be specified as well as a kitchen with the command \ \ &apos; start { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the Fast @-@ A@@ scen@@ sion Assistent of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a suitable function for rapid preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the document ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some of the document management . there can also be some of the document related settings .
document classes : this will be classified by the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ c &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
coding : this is set the character en@@ coding . modern systems are increasingly used to use UTF @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . in case , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( to correct processing the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages for lat@@ ex ; for the integration , only in the cross@@ roads .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) and you should always find using German texts .
new users have now not worry about . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is a simple problem to find that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is characterized by the modest appearance of output file . however , it is possible to save you by high@@ lighting time and more .
with automatic placement of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; , { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most open and sub@@ tler element ) :
in view of the document in the structure view , the single elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective transition and to be viewed .
when creating its own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; open @-@ un@@ interrupted file ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ d. File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and other information such as the font , and is also available in addition to PDF the output type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing from DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the file @-@ search , the elements of DVI ; -@@ File has been cli@@ cked on a element in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as soon as part of a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked , the appropriate section in DVI ; -@@ viewer is spec@@ kled .
Master @-@ Document : this function is used to work with multiple files . with a master document , the work is simplified with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project project can be adjusted to project project settings .
quick@@ set : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file recovery : in this mode the DVI ; file on the screen @-@ ready @-@ hold @-@ hold @-@ hold and there is no access to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick @-@ growing .
for viewing of the processor tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be developed . the selection box is designed for rapid inclusion of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the pur@@ g@@ able &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field more is available for items such as keywords , fox , notes , notes and references .
name : using this command , a description is created for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : is used for reference to a fixed term ( choose a selection box is possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries will be displayed . in &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are necessary to edit the file . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and can be k@@ ron@@ g@@ ly into &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the font of the font . it can be set the font for the main text , the notes , notes etc . , the following font components are set for :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two selection options are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and nur@@ turing of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by the bottom of the document .
the bra@@ ckets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the font is fixed . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do is to use the menu B@@ auen or the button quick .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; add the storage automatically .
if the document expi@@ res , the document should be searched after the errors . when using quick installation &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered .
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is different from the remaining document . for example , a report with the font contains 12 and only a few south pin should be a different correspondence with the font , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } encouraged the open to the font within the area .
the changes will only be supervised in the environment ( from \ \ &apos; n { group } up to \ \ &apos; ( environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the possibility of sub@@ missions within one environment .
there are many possibilities for increasing the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cour@@ si@@ veness , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either end with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ &apos; n { emp@@ h } : this command is available as long as long until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { stamp } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } recur@@ sively .
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ A { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex source code , now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions will follow , follows the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
as soon as in the assistant a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . for this , min@@ d. a quote , a few positions in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or C@@ tr@@ l e can be turned back to the editor ( at an internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the windows must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simple test and fun .
DVI ; a single file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ d. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF folder or computer monitor .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating a document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using file printing ( the viewer properly set ) .
the tool@@ bar feature the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into the tool@@ bar is able to start in the tool bar .
you will open the direct leap from the Editor to add @-@ in position within DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . only modern must set up with the K@@ ile settings ...
to order the pre @-@ search process , the mouse is positioned in one line of the source text and cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search for pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; click on a click of the central mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and set to the corresponding line . for this you need &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick design of the &amp; DVI ; viewer can &apos;t open it , you can submit an error . if a bug is pre @-@ indicated , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log@@ ging file is distor@@ ted the error source in the source code . in the editor , the entries can be used in the error . the protocols may be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faulty line .
once click on the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose a selection of documents for the document . the pre@@ set includes :
for a selection of empty document , a document can be used either of a new document or the assistant to the rapid preparation of a new document . further information on this section are included in the section .
basic users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded , to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you must either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file open or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by using a existing document and selecting file template .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings can be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables may be set in Settings ... Settings ... Settings set .
when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings can be replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by typ@@ ing in document class . typically , it will be used as the following : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ P@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that with the command in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document then the own template instead of the standard single document can be min@@ ed .
a template can be created from all &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in a simple way to create a template , should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps below described above .
&amp; k@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be done out .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to learn his personal possibilities the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can start with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called for the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an Ex@@ pen@@ sive description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with crossed C@@ tr@@ l key to display the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , click \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par to .
the text @-@ lined text will automatically be copied automatically when pulling the text .
when using the arrow keys , select parts of the source text in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse various types of source tex@@ tures and these empha@@ sizes . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , differ from normal text and also the mathematical formations are highlighted by another colour .
many assist@@ ants have to reach the jumping brand . this is a unique type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu entry is highlighted the leap to the n@@ most or last spr@@ int brand . thus , this spr@@ int brand is empha@@ sized that it will automatically become the first input of a character .
the processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate ; already outstanding possibilities for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . in processing , the following commands are included in the text code :
if a complete passage consists of ( group of rows , which contain on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not a text with through the source text , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive situation in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the image is separated by two empty lines .
the word in@@ lays down the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option has also an extended meaning , as this command is also lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a ratio ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to view a part of the document can be removed and removed by pressing the key . &amp; Kate ; offers the key solution for a faster connection . under editing are the following commands to contain the text :
removes a complete passage . the definition for a ship@@ ments in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of machining distribution .
it has been noted that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile provides ; for more commands under editing area for a sin@@ cer@@ ely simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly before the command to open the environment .
this command is inj@@ ected towards the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the order to close the doors .
if the cur@@ sor before or within the command \ \ &apos; begin { surroundings } is used to jump ( or vice versa ) .
when typ@@ ing of many extravag@@ ant environmental commands soon the public view can be lost quickly . this order closed the last modified environment , so that the spar@@ ed environmental structure will not be distor@@ ted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . in edit Te@@ X group , some important commands are to correspond to those made of processing environment .
this command is used at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded cl@@ amp .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the clas@@ p .
if the cur@@ sor before or behind the cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is , the other end of the group is inj@@ ected ( or vice versa ) .
when typ@@ ing of many scra@@ ped groups bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly to the desired group , this order closed the most recent group so that the spar@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be divided .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple operations are used as genes . for the purpose , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple operation signs . for example , the sign will be used for two simple purposes .
this automatic entry of the double starting point can be set under the K@@ ile settings ... La@@ Te@@ X and turn off .
there are also different settings ( e.g. n@@ ical or French ) or used for German or French purposes . there are also many other languages available .
when switching off Shift ; inputs and k@@ ile ; a smart t@@ asti@@ er breaks . if the current position is located within a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a tick @-@ break but also the command \ \ item .
close to a tables -@@ close t &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ associated with a close @-@ end line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be stored under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users may arrange the columns into tables and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to encourage and k@@ ile ; according to the next tab@@ ulator in the top line . although this tab@@ ulator is not added , add &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ space for the columns of the current tab@@ ul@@ ators .
although &amp; Kate ; already has a good source code completion , this in &amp; k@@ ile has been added ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , these modes are set for automatic change . all these modes are possible for different work conditions under the K@@ ile settings .
when beginning a new environment using the &apos; \ \ &apos; { Area } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the &apos; \ \ &apos; section after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when running the R@@ Ã ¼ inch button , the last letter of input will be removed and you are using the complete list on the other hand . on the other hand , the list can be dimin@@ ished by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you will be mixed with a selection of a command . alternatively , you can submit a jump to these positions via edit spr@@ int brand of spr@@ int brand , and the only parameters will be collected .
under Settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists are made . there are many different ways of choice for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as traces of the common language used .
the command mode is not suitable for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ &apos; time to be entered and the call of the completion mode is used for a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , environments are often used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments for processing .
when calling the case of understanding , the menu Edit menu or the button &quot; Alt + swit@@ ch@@ craft space bar will be automatically covered by the environment and it appears \ \ &apos; . afterwards , the environment will be continued on a simple way and through the installation of the typ@@ ing button .
after this is completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be mixed with .
under Settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists are made . this mode uses the list of the complete set of objects for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ line user @-@ defined lists of removable strings , which are immediately set up by the k@@ ile character strings . as an example of a c@@ ashing list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is included in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L has been entered and the word generated mode for the menu processor or the key type C@@ tr@@ l + alt idle button is replaced , the letter L is replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
certainly not helpful , the automatic change will not be helpful . however , it has been found that many of them can be written in a document more than once . this means &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion of all is already written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be able to set up K@@ ile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings ... K@@ ile gener@@ als . here , the swelling can also be set for the display of completion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the dialog graphics convin@@ ces the design of graphics as simple as possible . at the point of view of the basics , the sections should be considered and be considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for additional changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF edition is made , the pages can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script language tools and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to en@@ counter@@ act the result of the work , you have to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menu of creating comp@@ ile , creating change and creating view .
for the compilation of the source code for viewing as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be viewed by Alt ; 2 using Alt ; 4 using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and using Alt ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command fast , a viewer is usually called upon comp@@ ile . should not be used in a built @-@ in viewer , every time a new window will be open .
a new project will start the project New Project .... The following information is needed for the project :
when carrying the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ MA@@ cript parameters . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical case .
the API scripts are still not end@@ able yet , in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile , are still living .
first , it has to be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinct system that extends the basic functions in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of added packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . in it contains a documentation for the contained par@@ c@@ els and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a fully @-@ packed Ref@@ ec@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its â un@@ de@@ â s . it is not only about a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as is delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible aid offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and hier@@ archy , contains a graphical design area .
all documents are divided into categories and the great advantage is the search for package names , or perc@@ ussions , only the results are displayed .

everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; has been working on my opinion and how outstanding it is . do we take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! not more on a terminal ? simply click the icon for the XML @-@ processor and ready !
this application is expected to be a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is attached to the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folder and enter the folder in other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time when I &apos;m rest@@ art@@ ed .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentary already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphic interface .
if the only opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then it simply release the current working folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder , where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available .
if it comes to a output of the screen , their file is f@@ law@@ ed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file is already indicated in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then you can simply delete the current file . if not , delete it with current file the h@@ ooks and select the file using other file format .
if they only want to know if the well @-@ contained file is well @-@ formed , it will select a Well @-@ specific review selection .
for use of an &amp; DT@@ D ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML file ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG test is the indication of definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us should be selected , then you will simply select the current file . if not , remove the selection up @-@ to @-@ date file and select the file selection using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , such as the result should have named , the file is normally stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ in , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can also benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone can use the plug @-@ in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this plug @-@ in can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . you can find more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or an item , we start with the plug @-@ in menu . thus , the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog enables you to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in this :
here you can enter the search engine . adding plug @-@ ins in without a storage site &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often at a project several people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supported by team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to be a unique identification .
one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who he is . this happens by selecting the team member out of the list and the button S@@ etze is expresses . the currently selected member ( your identification ) will be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ name and the attitude of your identity are important in terms of news and notes . see further information about comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by creating the members of the team : it can be created an event for information on the team leaders when something specific happens . see further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific within the project is happening , such an example would be the listing of opening and closing of the project , so that a message would be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties Di@@ alog@@ es can be prepared , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the selected address selected in the recipient &apos;s list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see in , we@@ i will be set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes to notes is simple . it can be selected either the editor entry from the text context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary range followed by clicking text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( roll ) , with the nick@@ name of the premi@@ er sub @-@ project leader , is led by the enrich@@ ment and sub @-@ project leaders in the following examples , as outlined in the examples below .
nick@@ name and roles @-@ names are independent of big or small @-@ ap@@ hr@@ ink , but spaces for the bra@@ ckets and the note : make the note of invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ minimum table is and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set using j@@ ant@@ a settings . the device extends beyond some pages that will be treated differently .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car complet@@ eness can be changed . entries are :
large / Low tags of tags : large / Sm@@ aller ID par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase tags . normal large / small write means that tags are inserted as inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / small attri@@ bution of these attributes . normal big / small box means that the attributes will be inserted as they are described in the daily XML files .
optional tags automatically : if indicated , is optional for tags that is optionally available for the final day , immediately after the &amp; gt ; added .
no optional tags automatically include : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
upgra@@ ding and termination day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding closing day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic translation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs to the corresponding co@@ dation during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . by default , standard pre @-@ cores can be restored .
standard string coding : en@@ coding of newly created or in other ways than with open files ( where the code can be negotiated ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the Select DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is dischar@@ ged by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
generating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regular backup packages that can be restored with a blackout or crash when next start of the program can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . also not stored documents will be a backup regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in editing or own view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ y ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview , and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back in the next star@@ tup is useful if the user interface is through transi@@ tions of the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on opinions . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command @-@ line parameters .
the warning message area serves to control the possibility of switch war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ ken by no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the figure of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in details .
in the mou@@ sec@@ lick area on the structure tree , the following action is possible , by clicking on the structural construction with the mouse button@@ holes to change .
in the structural adjustment settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be opened automatically , and as deep in a change of structural changes will be opened automatically . blank no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found in which the current document was not found .
the scope of the abbrevi@@ ations of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ fold in the edit mode . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for multiple &amp; DT@@ EP ; s valid , it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause needs something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are the third page , which can be re @-@ used by each node @-@ capable application , on the best @-@ known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be given the following :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it is not on a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in during the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : verify that the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using to load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts refuse to load the store when this option is not elected .
check the Plu@@ gin : if this plug is activated , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; since version 3.3 , the trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting was completely re@@ developed . de@@ bug@@ gers support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug@@ in concept was implemented , allowing various implem@@ ent@@ ations on plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . along with the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a project is activated for a de@@ bu@@ gger , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view that is shown in the contents of supervised variables . usually appears in the left Do@@ ck .
a view where all holding points are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
in this promotion , the connection is required for de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on de@@ parts requirements . this action is activated by default when a project is opened , that must not be respected in the normal case .
the counter to de@@ bu@@ ck &apos;s session starts the meeting . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the lu@@ st@@ ling to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to enter a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script and the current line continuously . if this happens while the script is done , the execution will continue . if this happens , the script will start with the request .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without inform@@ ing information about control variables and the current line number . if this is done while a script is done , the execution will proceed as soon as a request is provided .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger will execute the next instruction in the script , without going into functions or includes .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible , if possible in functions and includes properties .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go over to the next , as if the current does not exist .
open a dialog box where a variable or expression may be entered . the monitoring value appears in the variable display .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl , is a work by Keith Is@@ dale like this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl , is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front end and a part of x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g that they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net to many more works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provide support for mar@@ up@@ - and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script language and the tool@@ bars . day folder include two file types , the tag folders ( above the edit window ) , which add text and instructions faster into a document , as a user may ever .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be uploaded or automatically created ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see details relating to transformation .
this document describes how tag@@ XML files are creating , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bar . in short , an &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the self @-@ ures@@ ome , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick setup of tags in a document without a risk of writing .
tag folders are nothing but file . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the writing language and version , so there . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and de@@ fied whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limits will be made in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only be found once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a single element type about itself nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the class type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has a common attribute , and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describe the attribute of a tags . this element can be found only once for each attribute . additionally , it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally , there is more tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
are the source code used for the attributes in the tag editing dialog and the attribute tree to the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting machine and a method@@ ology . the arguments that will be delivered to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can be used for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in the dialog . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags . this element is an only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element guy .
all day XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; -@@ Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ lled and closed .
spaces do not influence anything but respect &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not be replaced , but some pieces of the work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to launch and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A window . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . at present , check only in the shop of the Tag@@ XML @-@ files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Schem@@ atic &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schem@@ atic . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ atic tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; holiday name = &quot; over@@ load type = &quot; Vo@@ id &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is as quite simple and there is an editor that can be arranged via DT@@ D @-@ edit DT@@ D settings ; for one out of a list of sel@@ ectable &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = uses 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
one action can set up actions with settings ... created . click on New Promotion through the same dialogue :
this action has been assigned button@@ 1 button . click the user button to be assigned a button . with K@@ one you can remove the current key formula .
the easiest actions . it can be entered into the detailed settings and in version of the promotion , this text is inserted at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to modify the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
while qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way tries to find &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H It gives other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the document &apos;s URL . in the case of a local document , file : / out of the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used for the control of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
parameters of this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the described methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be made at the default setting . in the box input , the default input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . options include :
selected text : the document &apos;s selected area will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
according to the input can also be implemented the output of the executed application . there are two types of issue : normal edition written on the default issue ; error messages can be specified , which is to be done on the default copy , by default the set @-@ down output is set :
if there are many Tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to set the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create any group of their own tool@@ bar . in given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings instructions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes and you use their use , activate the dialog &quot; Day &quot; when available , so that a input when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action with this symbol ? are we replacing it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the promotion is better represents , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ ost@@ als ; select from the menu menu ; , graphic further programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ ography ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose editing size others .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to realize what the promotion does , but also all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually interpreted as los , star@@ red , further interpreted ) , or should at least set a message to the user , start@@ ling ; -@@ day to add in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press him .
select the folder , in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
push the button and continue along with other tags , so there are still which are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some normal &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool bar supplement or it should set this for a better overview by some Tren@@ ker into several groups . open the tool bar to set up dialog on tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ker ( on top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to tool bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the tool bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool bar .
please note , as the separate group@@ ing support . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by che@@ ating all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
back in the correct folder . after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it is stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar should be stored in the right file . please adjust their tool bar ( s ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal users the option to add documentation to the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language , which you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , check out in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ os@@ itory , if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to search an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , we leave you to handle the second part here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentary section 1 = _ 1.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , you can see in the &amp; PHP file ; documentation :
# K@@ DE config file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top element = php , documentation Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Dis@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ synchron@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the ch@@ ute depth ( except through reason ) md@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the Bau@@ man@@ View &amp; md@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but respect &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed in context of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two kinds of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of related context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your do@@ cr@@ c file simply save up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / share / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have specified this in your do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation is used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked at the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the hidden resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an email option , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool@@ bar menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where any other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and used for publication . to make use of a useful contribution , we recommend the resources of resources to be provided for our team as well as for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) or in the event that you will need multiple keys , you can continue an input . in the dialog New Resource , you &apos;ll need to continue an input ( URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to upload the upload .
upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload , tool@@ bar , most tool@@ bar , and appear in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , nor before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the authentic@@ ity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and the signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the indication of the author &apos;s author .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ language , which is currently not produced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it can be tim@@ ed because hundreds of day files might be needed in the day . there is easier way to convert DT@@ D to an DT@@ EP package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and convert from DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description that is to be used . afterwards the following dialog appears :
the goal name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string that appears in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d is to be released
fine adjustment from DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , bring &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; according to converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly introduced &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand and make full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little bit of use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projection . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; available , available in the joint folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of ad@@ ministr@@ ators of different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most limited size . all elements are set aside in the folder &apos;s folder , what are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction manager , the cart@@ ons with info and the tool bar . please suggest in , and for more information about these areas .
you can click into the right button to obtain a context menu with the right mouse button , such as close to the current , other or all un@@ loading , new loading , er@@ ase or upload of document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click on the Edi@@ tor@@ tion section to create a further context menu in terms of the document content , such as basic editing steps ( copy / paste / paste in ) , editing the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor , the tool bar is located in the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and therefore linked to user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then you can insert the symbol that is the day represents , then you can insert the data for this just one day . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the construction manager ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate and cross it in the information &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate to files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction manager .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out with the then shown context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole web site &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; industrial templates are always available , local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects . more to templates is available .
here you can find information about the script language . the concept of setting in global , local and project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to restart , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . through the left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor will be placed on the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and the refresh@@ er of the tree is opened .
this tree appears among other construc@@ tions . with it , man@@ oeu@@ v@@ attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can be changed . this allows to change the attributes of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded , edited and viewed from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; document website can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes in the bottom end of the window , can be reached via the usable information : the news window and the problem .
this flash@@ point shows information on each in Qu@@ ant@@ a running script . such as the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this flash@@ y displays all error in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bar is extensive and easy to understand . showing them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the tool bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ sar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other ass@@ ure and un@@ load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; auto@@ conf file a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check whether your path is the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H before her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide variety of functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; coding ; the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with a obvious , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer in pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; K@@ DE ; designed , in good use of free software , the idea of why else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old it is not only everything possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can be increased productivity almost every task . through the program Kom@@ m you can realize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; extend without any scrip@@ ting lingu@@ istic @-@ tax loss . ( find out more about them in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ lower Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , where the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . check in the section via templates . should you try to save the selected file / Text outside the local / project template . only a mistake is reported .
conver@@ ts to inser@@ tion from the cli@@ p@@ board there is special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ en@@ coding , so it is correct and not properly displayed by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instructions .
convert the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase , which the correct path to insert of special signs and spaces in &amp; URL ; it &apos;s primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor @-@ tag .
switches the block selection or off . this allows you to pick text blocks with the help of the &amp; shift ; key to choose .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are issued !
searches a string or regular expression in selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions in order to help you .
displays the message window . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and en@@ roll@@ ment of the problem repor@@ ters at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main driver . the problem reporter is activated once the structure changes .
indicates the symbols turn left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when reading Book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear together with entries to date or next , depending on the cur@@ sors position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphic files in your project file or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
download the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are the details expl@@ aining details .
loads a project tool bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
to add a dialog to add a new tool bar . this is created only the name . actions must be saved by default actions . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars as tool@@ bars or you are asked at the end if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removed a tool bar from the screen . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do this .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows to upload tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
upload one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has done and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
un@@ load / re@@ peti@@ tive entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense to renew the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder will not be present , the store fails .
this menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tools . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is available , there is a sub @-@ menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows you to access the current day installation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; specific sub@@ menus .
activated / activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently it works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar , if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins listed below the above listed item is enabled . click into the plug@@ ging plug@@ ins activated .
elec@@ ts the value mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application Ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch @-@ over may sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode that is also the default mode , or the default mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu for each open window , includes an entry . with selecting an agreement the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
displays the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main windows .
the changes in this dialog can use any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part including the &amp; constellation ; web brow@@ sers .
address the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ rent editor . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate ; you find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add names and sequences .
this should produce an help according to the mouse @-@ carrier environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always help use . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form will find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , as for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties .
here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be completed automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can see the server address of the machine to access one , except for local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ Exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log is used . depending on the remote computer settings , an adaptation may be necessary .
this is the folder , in which the templates for the project is stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder , where the tool@@ bars can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change . in ser@@ vers@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed otherwise .
def@@ endant , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is started an@@ ew , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of vou@@ ches .
this shows a list of files in main folder . you can select the desired files through an@@ ha@@ ken or by removing the hair@@ pin , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu @-@ frame Profile , or with the button closure Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are newly ignored during project @-@ related operations such as project folder .
supplem@@ entary option on top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is re@@ loaded during opening the project , can be read more about project views .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin is currently supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the option options . the de@@ bug is described in .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as viewing a tree @-@ view for the contents of the server for each profile , indicating your own structure of your profile .
in the sub@@ window of Team configuration , project members can be added , edited , or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub @-@ window configuration , one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions , if a certain event occurs when a certain event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior .
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the project opens and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you charge a new project .
the project view provides free access to the files in the project . the files can be managed in the current project .
file behave as well , however , the entries are open and opening together with ... in the right @-@ to @-@ point mouse menu :
various profiles can be searched here . the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files . see .
enables the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be b@@ lown to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in core memory and must be forgotten for programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un @-@ secure password on the record store is not possible .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue when you change your opinion from the upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ capacity profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . in the editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not have service to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them after your discre@@ tion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be used in a project many views , i.e. by simple de@@ parts of the view , diverse files and tool@@ bars can be loaded , and replace the latest opened files and tool bar .
views can be stored in the project , or project tool bar , accessible via settings of tool@@ bar @-@ tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has the most to do . this does not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own work mode .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best via the tool bar . use and add to app@@ r . adding tool bar is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be configured either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) in which can be done with new action , tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialog , which can be specified , which should be displayed on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , additional entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up the tool@@ bars in the menu with settings and set settings .. set .
templates are essentially fac@@ tual , code sni@@ ff , and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses basically as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the existing folder in the storage space . templates in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read that in the beginning of any template specified conditions before use .
Bin@@ ary is everything that &apos;s not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates normally are inserted into documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the store room under global templates .
documents can be created from any text document . based on this templates , new documents can be created . usually , special sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a proper way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the same room for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted into the documents , but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see some examples in the store room below global templates . see more information about the templates .
as the name says we are serving these templates for all websites as templates . you are a collection of different documents , which can be organized in a folder tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
design a document structure according to Beli@@ eving ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As Templ@@ ate Save As Local Templ@@ ate ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage area under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template store as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection is simply drawn with pulling and shut@@ down to the Bau@@ man@@ tle templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file will only copy in a template file . you can use all file management functions for it , such as pulling and disman@@ t@@ ling or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
one can click in the file tree or in the project files Bau@@ man@@ views to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , the project file is secured , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project presentation enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head lines and foot@@ er lines or link dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition , some things can keep on using templates in projects very deep in the eye .
the template structure in the under@@ window templates is based on the files based in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / Templ@@ ates . each of these folders correspond to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder in the text overview , click on the folder and select menu properties , which appears in the context menu :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is b@@ lown away as soon as El@@ ter@@ elles attributes can be burned .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except for regular folders in the previous overview . if a regular folder would be configured unless they would appear explic@@ it . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder .
allowed prior or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ line or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head@@ line / foot@@ er a full presentation already with the matching head@@ line / foot@@ er .
in addition , you have a text menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that is easily accessible via the menu view . the first mode will replace the source editor in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and re@@ activate at need for the source code editor where the changes implemented in the V@@ PL ; editor is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP . it is not possible to edit them directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change these behavi@@ our@@ al references .
the second mode is just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is enabled , and the cur@@ sor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; mode is already active , does this mode offset the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a . if you choose from Synchron@@ ization for a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be set . in general , the recommendation is to be set : a small chip@@ board for quick calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow .
assuming that one wants to change the title of the website so tools is possible to choose from invisible tags in work with the V@@ PL ; it is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it is used to change the suspension of the hands of the hands . this is how you can change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the change of inhal@@ ing , e.g. key words on the column name and keyword keyword F@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to create browser views in the browser . it can add CSS rules with buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to insert an external CSS styl@@ ing system by pressing the file button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is as in a word Processing , possible by moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor will behave as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted into and be deleted by pressing or distances .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is too short notice that the inser@@ tion tags is not removed before , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , every other re@@ turn@@ table must be removed .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists wi@@ zard are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release must be used the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .

there are many graphical tools to the same . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain shortly , why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had been corrected as many changes , and at the same time , another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with merge .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where maybe the deposit had changed . these changes had a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a row and changes to white signs . later any amount of additional useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare it quickly , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly to a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two persons are independent of each other at a piece of co@@ ke and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps and make changes that are expected at the same time . in this Editor , you can even edit the result even directly . in this Editor , you can even edit the result even directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with the compar@@ isons and mer@@ c@@ ements complete folders . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with file merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the precise differences and user @-@ based capabilities of current color monitors . if you often need to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines only differ in certain number of white signs , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no sleeves , if no one changes the onset . )
if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can facilitate ti@@ p@@ work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
diff@@ use 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 @-@ o target folder , diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ o Ob@@ jective folder
open Dialogue enables the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file again ; if you leave the entry for C blank , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ ing or mer@@ ging of folders will be inserted , but if for A a file is selected , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file name from A in the two other folders .
if M@@ erg@@ ing is checked , the input field is active for target and it is not necessary to determine immediately a output file . you can also do this step later on storing .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but rather than parts of a text . &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; allow you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active comparison window . the comparison starts out immediately . in opening dialogue , you do not need to select any files , you can simply connect the dialog box .
you can also use pulling and merge : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text editor and let it drop over a comparison window .
what sort of thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you would like to find out how similar these features are , they would need to load two corresponding files they are in &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now you can simply copy the relevant sections , add , and then compare .
note : currently , you can pull out anything from &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can only get rid of text in a comparison window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and disman@@ tle of text in another program as cut out and insert text ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box the info @-@ line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) each Info line has a different color . ( if the path is too long , leave the mouse for a while over the line . then a small auxili@@ ary window will display the full name . )
the three source codes are the letters A , B and C are assigned . a color blue , B , the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees the color that distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) good .
on the left next to the text , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , B. are white signs only relevant in strings and commentary , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases relevant . )
the vertical line divi@@ des the summary column from the text , is interrupted at the occasions , where the respective source file has no lines . if the line demo@@ li@@ tion is activated , the line will be displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison models ) also has a Info @-@ line with the inscription edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; modify &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next @-@ dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons can be used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
through one click of the left mouse button in one of the windows selected , the first line of the group is marked in all windows , and the first line of the group is indicated . ( this group will also not be visible in the windows . ) This group becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background colour for current area and each left hand appears a black beams .
sometimes the automatic interaction or by manual do no longer stays in the group ; then there is only one plac@@ eholder for the event that you will change your mind and perhaps again a different source . this text is not published in the final open file , nor in a mark that you may copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge pages ; however , it appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore the numbers , or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this will navigate mostly with the frame rate and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , end , tr@@ l @-@ beginning and tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ f as you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ lap column next to the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking here .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default setting is the input mode . )
one click of the left mouse button to synchron@@ ize the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group ( as described in the section called together and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l picture ) . therefore , all deleted conflicts must be distinguished as a conflict .
to copy the mar@@ ker into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insert ) . if this is enabled , what always you mark , automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board , and manually copy the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ les are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX @-@ variants use a line @-@ in @-@ run \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car backward + \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the source of the source files . therefore , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the last used files are automatically saved and recovered during the next start . ( menu configuration &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a typ@@ ef@@ ace with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog is also available with variable latitude to choose , you should not use this . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen scrip@@ ture cannot support this account , nothing happens .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator window will insert the corresponding number of spaces , otherwise it will be inserted a tab@@ ulator icon .
if you press entry or return , the one line will automatically be used for the next line as well .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which the line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when converting files tries to find k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back@@ drop &apos; \ &apos; on the end of a row , other again save &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ drop , but then you could be visible with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then how a white sign is treated , however , if this option must be disabled . in default , this option must be disabled . in default , this is de@@ activated .
the default setting is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored the differences , but they are treated like white characters .
the default setting is de@@ activated . changes in comm@@ ent@@ aries are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic @-@ forward mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is indicated before going on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically removes all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if the automatic selection of many files are less important . if you don &apos;t use the features W@@ ähle A / B / C for all ung@@ el@@ ly white conflicts of the merge menu . note that the automatic selection may ignore conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge . see for details of documentation on the directory and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is called Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ stock exists , this will be deleted without a further backup .
fits the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must finish and restart , so the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted globally via the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , all entries will be used for the top setting .
in the selection fields for the coding , a short notice which is the local en@@ coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file coding for source files . this influenced how special characters can be treated and interpreted , since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , can be compared to files with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can choose which coding for storing is to be used .
if you define processes , you might have to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the default command can only define with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of output control panels .
switch off the pre @-@ emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is available only if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are shown in a color coded over@@ lap column . however , sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to the normal one another transfer column with the required information .
sometimes you &apos;d like to use the available room on the screen for long lines . simply check out the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window by side or against each other . this can also be useful for viewing rows of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click will then perform the merge menu as well if you use only two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file , it will be delivered first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write this function for example , for example out of out of the parts or to correct the alignment .
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used . the output of the command is only used at the line . you can write your own prec@@ ept . every input line must have an appropriate issue line .
the thought behind is to enable users more flexibility when set up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases used sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this process command to convert the input into case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . * is a erg@@ ent expression of the first text in a row . the \ \ 1 creates the found text in the first cl@@ utch couple . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated strings written ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . * \ \ $ / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command to be suitable for line off . it &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ wel &#91; &apos; &#93; is a hit , and each showing will be replaced by nothing , so basically deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several symptoms at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the requirements from each other . example :
instead of sed sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; However , per@@ l needs some details in per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and maintain . further operations only change the data , which appears the line @-@ down algorithm .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off processor is the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you can &apos;t notice certain differences and will see important data in the worst case .
often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete file recur@@ sively and merge .
... makes for every object a proposal to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate it and shows the simul@@ ated changes , without it really perform ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog File .
if three files are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders does not start the merge . to run the merge , you need to select the corresponding option line or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during the reading folder , you will notify a small news window about the current progress . if you break scanning the folder , only the files are listed until then .
when scanning the folder is done , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows a list window with the results on the left , ...
every file and any folder made during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure will normally be folded . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or click on the item by clicking on the button and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the sub@@ directories with which you can open all folder .
if you double click on a file , file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and the details pane . in such a case , the merge action can &apos;t be automatically elected . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , columns A / B / C are available in red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folder will be considered identical if all of the content is identical . then folder the same color . with folders , the age is irregular for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a sheet again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C not have the same file type ( e.g. A a folder and B one file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ t@@ less objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. A a folder and B one file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ts exist , the cl@@ erg@@ ing cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no exp@@ on@@ ite target folder were activated , and if the option is synchron@@ ize directories . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary support , so that both files are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible data name for the output file only B ; copied directly after comp@@ iling &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folder will be merged and select the new file instead . if the files are different , but the date of files are different , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the merge can &apos;t be started .
during meeting a file is done according to the other . it status column indicates that if the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected is completed , you should make a final review and check if the status is all right .
if set the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts is only displayed if three files are compared or merged . )
you can merge either the selected entry ( file or above ) , or select all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then it will be used in three @-@ file association @-@ merge mode , when the two @-@ file association will lead B as target and syn@@ cing A and / or B as target .
if you select a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped in folder . check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises :
to put all entries together : select directory entry / continue on the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the button closure ) . in order to put up only the current entry , select the actual El@@ ements or press F@@ 6 .
if supported by contradic@@ tory file types , a message appears to exist on the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you run all entries , a dialogue window with the options will run , phr@@ ases and break .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without being done really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then takes certain actions with all entries . if a manual operation is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( notice the screenshot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select restart inter@@ mitt@@ ance / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t stored yet , an appropriate dialogue appears . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry will continue .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a bug it appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to trigger the cause of the problem or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them together again . even if the merge was passed over or not stored , these entries will be handled correctly . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ ic@@ able ... ) has now a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files appearing on the specified patterns are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . the default plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . there can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . there can be more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be specified using a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ signals . )
in some fil@@ esystem files , files have a file attribute . in other file systems , a previous file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ baum or not . this option is switched on .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . when the option is enabled , files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ) will not lead to a final sli@@ ps and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es down . ) This option is shut down in default .
execute a complete analysis of any file through and shows statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower when it is applied to files containing no text . ( specify an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large files across a slow network , it &apos;s likely to compare just the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please use with caution . this option is set on .
similar to confidence of change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal to the same . this option can be useful when copying the change date . please be careful to use this option .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode , when two files are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging is so selected , that afterwards both files are identical . the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched on .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is assumed to be uncertain , because the other file is not changed too . ) This option is displayed in any case . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version is renamed and receives the original version . if an old backup file is already deleted , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal coll@@ ision single files , not just the merge of whole folder . this option is switched on .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view is visible to the mer@@ ging single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch off the window . if you don &apos;t want to switch off main window in the window menu , switch between directory and text window between the two opinions .
you may probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is also a single file directly , without the folder command . as soon as you store the file , the status is set up and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost , however , if you read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path may be relatively und@@ one or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ king . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example has a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol , it follows a brief list of limitations :
or it can not be differenti@@ ated if a link indicates a file or folder . then , a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , FTP : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or change date . therefore , vary the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( note the option confidenti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main reason is currently referred to as a difference @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts to start the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then choose in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part show from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then , de@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch program to restore the missing file .
in the quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part 2 . please note that it doesn &apos;t work if no of the original files exists . also , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is performed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . merge or the compar@@ ing of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compression ) exist . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GP@@ L programs very long and I learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers that go this way or going to be so .
you &apos;ve probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script . in default , configure / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , you will find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines will be treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white characters is different , the line is not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to Each other , this is is but this is often the case .
the editor is obvious to any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . this important information is simply lost , however , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design extra a private file format which could save this information .
the work is so far too large . you can always restore a specific version through selecting a source A / B / C . for larger quantities , another editor should be used .
after removing the text is suddenly mentioned ; no sr@@ c left ; released and the text can &apos;t be extingu@@ ished . what does it mean , and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 functions ; you may need to use &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .

only differences are shown : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to read the folder with the function updates automatically . )
there are only entries to display the differences . if the target file does not already contain these files . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after comp@@ elling . ( the behavior is likely to be amended in a later program version . ) This option is switched off .
note the buttons on selecting the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , lines from the corresponding windows are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
the default setting is disabled . under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; showing a miniature preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite practical to see the ongoing programs on the work@@ space , to finish her size , to finish it or move them . this works both within a desktop and in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces , as well as in current applications . applications can be selected and can even be moved to desktop and others .
the middle mouse button lets you move within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; movement is possible both within a desktop and other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked out : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it is cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , it also appears the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , in mind and end .
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of mind . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check@@ box is marked , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; with the middle mouse button on your desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the virtual work@@ space name is displayed .
cross this field , you can view the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . is it along with name advertis@@ ed , the names are provided with ordin@@ ances , and eg ; 1 . mind .
if this field is crossed , the background of every desktop is also displayed as a background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; if only the empty work space is indicated in order to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; published in a 2x@@ n grid , such as from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows @-@ managers ; horizontal , all virtual work@@ space shows in a vertical range , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols , or with their contents . it also runs outside the control bar .
click on the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent exit of switch switches ... enables the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in dialogue settings , but you can do it manually :
do not open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not apply to your system administrator to your system administrator . in this file , you must apply the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ency mode and apply to that a value . possible values are :
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

if you can start , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged range of screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default settings &amp; k@@ ak@@ y ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile device . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ es@@ like ; with an selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the surrounding area of the mouse poin@@ ter on the screen ( eg ; on the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with arrows and mouse button and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window , and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fying growth and move . this also goes with the arrows keys .
if you are in addition to the &amp; shift ; key or die &amp; M@@ MB ; use the select window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the box is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ t has a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who suffer the re@@ peti@@ tive strain of the jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and which each mouse click pain@@ s pain@@ s . however , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that emerg@@ es when clicking the mouse , and helps to use so many people using the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may suffer from pain that related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet .
to put it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; painful men@@ tions that are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the desire of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic sources , the result may differ for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the motion .
the smart push is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it em@@ ulated the mouse button . move it until the end of the motion before the letting go of the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling with pressing mouse buttons . this intelligent sliding requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly .
let &apos;s go after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click a mouse click .
if intel@@ lect has switched on , the revol@@ ting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after supp@@ ress the mouse button , before it leaves the mouse button , if there is no need for the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving forward and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving picture is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt for the first time , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears to be delayed , you can reduce the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ control centre ; go on sound &amp; multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider line . there is a sliding sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please select the respective documentation to find out how to start the program automatically .
put all settings on the values that were set to the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of users .
at best , use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should first be turned off . if you are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the smart push .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; K@@ DE ; in sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click is without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on digits in the browser window , which does not represent a link , does not carry unnecessary reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually rather simple . the trick is that you do not only cleaning the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you have to take out the mouse ball . as that happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the ball . these are located on the sides of the Loch@@ es where the ball was inserted . the dirt and the plast@@ ering can be scra@@ pped with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system canc@@ els the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if it was just a move @-@ end , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool does not mean that the surgery can no longer stop by letting the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you are able to run yourself a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset , and you may continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter Text , drag &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to make it . however , you can make the mouse on a neutral area of mind , if you do not want to make a missed mouse cli@@ cks . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter is &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you deal with it . it &apos;s very unlikely to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board and move back to any other action , where you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse buttons . however , there will probably be some problems . here are some advice on this :
do not use smart shifting if you just start to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead : perform a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and once again move the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will be played every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly , when in the intelligent shifting the delay time begins . but later you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window must be installed ; this should be the case for most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble cli@@ cks is only available if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker , and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; actu@@ ated the mouse poin@@ ter once the mouse poin@@ ter briefly . this program was developed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and to whom the mouse button@@ ed pain@@ s are processed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured as a certain period of time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way , pulling and shut@@ down can be carried out with the mouse .

with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the phr@@ ases phr@@ ases which are to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which later is used for the speech output of text . further details will be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text password . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type . text passages can of course be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) you define the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ination . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can cancel the word @-@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only sp@@ elled words can be included in the Wor@@ lds game .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly visible and contains essentially an input field for the key@@ ring of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen photo ) and a orbit of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screenshot ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; correct , you can add in the input field the sentences you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the se@@ per@@ ate memory . you can select from these sentences which are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings menu k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the installation dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , speech output and settings , the side Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ as and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in an input field of the speech output , enter the command to call the language . in the box below , you specify the character en@@ coding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; uses two ways to pass the lyrics . select the check@@ box when the text will remain unchanged as standard entry to the language generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text is further given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command would depend on your voice generator . this command will find you in the documentation to your language generator . examples are listed below .
with Pos@@ sible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that &apos;s successful , the other settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language is a standard interface for speech output and which is currently useful in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection of action , after selecting a text passage , you define what action is triggered by the keyboard passage or passage of a passage passage in the Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ das menu , or in the case for text passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is added directly and added in addition to the input area . with selecting from In the input field , the selected text passage is initially only entered into the input field .
with the second selective box , the processing service for text pass@@ agen@@ das can be set , whether the text configuration textbook should be stored automatically when sending the processing service .
when selecting the text password book the book is stored . if you select changes , the text password is not stored . select Save As , and k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text password is to be saved .
the site of Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ an contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the time . in the main window , next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop down box , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this radio box you can choose the currently used dictionary .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export it to a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
choose for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by calling the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add only correct words to the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask the dic@@ tion@@ aries summar@@ ized , and how these weights are to be taken .
with this option , you will create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for processing text passages is double divided . in the upper part , the text passages are presented as tree structure .
in the lower section you can edit an selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the appropriate key@@ code . if you select a textbook book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages , or books add or select text passages and books , you can either delete either the choice in the menu bar , in the tool bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by pulling the mouse to the new spot , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the circul@@ ator .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the circul@@ ator .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the bill .
this menu entry is checked , a shifting tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool bar is arranged directly under the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left @-@ left side and pulling , the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed is a narrow table in the bottom part of the main window with indication of the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a twi@@ sted table for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is ordered by default on the tool@@ bar directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left @-@ left side and pulling , the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
probably you have not entered the order for the speech output not correctly or not fully entered . open settings at@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings , and enter the command for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ( see configuration dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . )
Festival is a language version system of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and French are supported . the license allows to use the Festival free of charge and spread on restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is believed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the command to the language version is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and spread on restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the language version , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ie file . the speech output is then possible with one of the three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ essen , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in ph@@ on@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / Ji@@ fax and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax loves the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be attached . the entire command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / Ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / / mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / d@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the default data must be enabled .
the language output dem@@ on by &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; further language service that provides a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different speech output systems .
since setting up the voice can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use possible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setting the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; it is a application that cannot speak with the people who cannot speak , text by calcul@@ ator . it is stored a list of pro@@ longed sentences which the user can always be re@@ covering again .
notice that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer which does not have to be installed on the machine .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( specify either this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or restart k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a modules existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part @-@ system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; it is ready to feature their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also , the users offers interesting options .
read texts ( or sharing ) in text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications embedded .
the speech output is done via the program Computer @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; uses .
allows the creation of language editions in the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ relief program .
in future : support for speech @-@ market language like Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language version service of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without any visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for the read of the texts from a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ c@@ de@@ .org , Channel # K@@ DE Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , you must install the tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
when the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card @-@ card details will be displayed .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such as different variants for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you should also set several variants for a syn@@ thesizer before you use &amp; kt@@ ats , as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printers in the same printers .
if you click on the card dealer in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , and no speaker is set up .
all the already furnished speaker will appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for speech output if a application has no speaker .
with one mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the nar@@ rator from the list .
in a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the spokes@@ man on the list below . the sequence of spokes@@ persons in the list will also be their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; -@@ System .
here is a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls agree to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker is on the card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can go back to the card of General and verify that the T@@ TS service is run by &amp; K@@ DE ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; see to read text files to create and manage text contracts . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language board system by &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the card keys to open the card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops . this starts to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text entries and read it . see . remove the marking , will be modified K@@ TT@@ SD and the TS @-@ System by &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs &amp; kt@@ ops continue to activate the field output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start text contracts , break , pause and record .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click on application or OK , then all @-@ changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the board map orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to activate K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card keys to activate and cross voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check the text that is to read , and select the text , read text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web site . you can ski@@ p this step even , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tensions and other un@@ seen stamps are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text displayed . first , check the text that is to read , and select the text file format . then , select the text output .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system by &amp; K@@ DE ; to notify you of fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various kinds of messages . for example , you can set up a message when in a IR@@ C @-@ channel a message appears where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
support A &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry notification of the program &apos;s Settings menu . here , the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter to character collection offer a good way to correct and correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which belongs to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / In@@ box , as these can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for regular work with &amp; kt@@ ops , filters are not required .
in filters , text will be edited , before it will be sent to the program fru@@ str@@ at@@ cher . you are useful to improve the pron@@ unci@@ ation to in@@ correctly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to handle certain defects of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the mode of filtering it is important to know how the program &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops . diff@@ ers four kinds of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged on all other orders . if the output of the screen Reader is pre @-@ read , orders will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is for@@ getting hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone can welcome you who just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read also .
the rest are simple text contracts . any order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that use text contracts . text contracts are thought for longer texts that have no particular emphasis .
all four order types are operated in queu@@ e , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just such a pre@@ reading , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction . they are used on normal war@@ nings , messages , and text contracts , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter . at the moment there are three kinds of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future , there can be further kinds of filters .
character pieces replacing parts of a text by text . can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined strings such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ at@@ ering of news from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert images into another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , some X@@ SL@@ T files are contained in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
for example , you can send orders depending on the text of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops . if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages over . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about this .
each of the different filter has an adjustable rules after which he applied for a language version . if the filter states that its rules does not apply , he will continue the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; message is sent , it is handled by all activated filters , which were set up on the page below . processing is done in order in order in the list of top down .
this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogues .
for the creation of character documents , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ative pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged with the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ reference will not be considered when compared .
enter your filter for a name . you can choose your name . you can only choose from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column line and replaces it in accordance with the character string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed order from top to bottom .
to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions from a file that can save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is applied only if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is listed here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type multiple programs separated by comm@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
application ID run programs can be obtained with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers must be we@@ eg@@ ed . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is indicated , you may only enter copying files .
the drawing filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry into the box Di@@ esen filter if agreed . if all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared to words , character filtering filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited on both sides ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no guide to write regular expressions . if you have the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations and # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations and # 160 ; expressions are am@@ big@@ uous in the package am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . but it can only be applied on well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
set the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the optional filter , you can send text to a certain subject , which is set up on the card speaker , or on a speaker with certain features . you can , for example , indicate that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops provide a text to the filters , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the spokes@@ man is selected using the text editor that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; send , and the characteristics of the or@@ ator on the back@@ card speaker can be translated to the selected speaker .
if a value is specified here , the filter is used , if the text contains the specified regular expression . if the text is available on your system the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; if you have a click on the button you can click on the button to get the input on the button .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the characteristics of the desired microphone station here . if the text is the above mentioned filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button to indicate the dialogue selection .
use these buttons to store or delete your custom settings , or delete all settings .
the optional filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry into the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must apply at least one condition .
the language version API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; can help with the programmer to lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the language syn@@ thesizer , so that it can use syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
the following section includes a short description of the K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the language version API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for speech output via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; by the kt@@ ts@@ d program on the object K@@ pe@@ an .
here is text of the text to read and option an language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you can :
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . just launch the kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ formed filter , but when using module for Festival websites , web pages are not pre @-@ read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able does not work . you will also need to do that if you do not need this voice to read the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and to find the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable .
certain characters or character signs seem to cause mistakes to syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole sentences is ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ cat@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option is set to be fixed on the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , this may be solved by a character en@@ forcement filter . see .

the syn@@ thesizer which can be used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license which you will find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE code archives , you can download the package deal with &amp; kt@@ ops ; see from it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; find the source code from k@@ de@@ . under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages you can find at the project page htt@@ p : / / specialty ac@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and I@@ bic@@ bio .
KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , take the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ops , according to information which are not yet contained in this manual .
the program &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ tive module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops for use any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , join the developer team in connection .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory , but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you purchase the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ops , which refer to the source code for k@@ de@@ files or select the tar@@ ball at present , then install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , first check that the tool @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the SPD @-@ script file .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops that uses the program tool disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be developed so that the device must not be used directly and the SPD @-@ conf script does not need any more .
a long text is de@@ composed in single sentences . the user may continue to rec@@ ap , repeat or cancel the output .
if you specify an application text to &amp; kt@@ ops , for example , it can request a female English speaker for example . if you have set up a speaker , the language English and its sex is female , it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops are chosen , you will see a speaker , see in .
when you click on the card speaker , click on to add or edit a speaker to the list or edit , the card @-@ card speaker display is shown . as an example , the module guides will be shown in the following format . for details on the modules , you will find details below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival .
choose the character en@@ coding for text , which is passed to Festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops are known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , western languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slides , you can adjust volume , voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a number of controllers and the grey display , you do not allow you to choose the voice of your settings .
some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n vote will need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you are loaded this check@@ box , these voices are already loaded with K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set will be made faster .
if this junction box cannot be selected , you don &apos;t have set up a speaker ( or remember to click ) . see .
if the check@@ box is marked , it is displayed at the Start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , it is visible after starting only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system segment , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system to preview the program window .
if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t run yet , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . so , you have the possibility to stop or otherwise control them .
here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just working sentence . the speaker @-@ ID represents the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can take a full @-@ in order that is selected on the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other credit cards ) will be sc@@ aled when and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text contracts are listed and ad@@ ministr@@ ated . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the news types of dict@@ ations ; find in .
select the kind of audio output . if one component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops were compiled or dict@@ ated ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , or &amp; kt@@ ops , can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for the audio output , choose the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you choose AL@@ SA , choose the PCM device . see also

click on application to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt select standard .
on this map card , you can set special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ats ; processed four kinds of language versions :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be dra@@ gged on all other orders . once the output of the screen Reader has been read , orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is getting hot . a warning holds the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after the warning of the warning .
News do the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that says messages . if you have &amp; eg ; just a long text on a web site , you can watch with &amp; k@@ mouth ; still feel someone who enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen readers , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e long one .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played in front of the introduc@@ tory news .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text contracts . for messages , war@@ nings , and the issues of screen re@@ els there are no particular actions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; read notice messages , start ct@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click to noti@@ fications . noti@@ fications are al@@ erts .
mark this check@@ box to switch the check of &amp; K@@ DE ; if this setting is not marked , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ops are not read noti@@ fications before .
if this setting marks , noti@@ fications of which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops . not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sends if someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
all events in which there is nothing else specified in the list , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops .
use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops are supposed to do when an event applies . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the details of the desired speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , which is shown in the list on board speakers as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if it is defined for a specific event of a certain application , this will be executed . otherwise , the promotion is implemented for all other events of the specified application . the last possibility comes to carry out the action that was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events may not be deleted from the list ) as follows :
use the button to store the settings stored in a file . use the button to store the stored settings stored in a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all noti@@ fications except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a speech output , the voice speed , the volume , the gender of voice and pitch . also trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , used at the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch is not configured in the festival configuration dialog , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filtering - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional character filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ats , faster with the first set , as only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or cancel the whole text order , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support them directly .
here , you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional protection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , the default setting filter will be automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add another set limits filters , but it is dis@@ cour@@ sed .
easiest to learn to sample the set of speaking selection through sample selection . check out the speech selection contracts , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ats , change some properties and check how the choice of the microphone has changed . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then start to read more quickly , as only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then order text contracts on board map contracts , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional feature filter is automatically set up when you launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . it can not be removed , only removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ ofs and include a tab@@ ul@@ atory sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( de@@ code characters are automatically removed from the filter ) . note that the standard movement control filters are signat@@ ories .
S@@ BD @-@ filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ screen ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen reproduction .
if you have removed the normal movement control filter , you can insert it again by charging the in &amp; kt@@ ops ; included the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the board selection menu , you can ski@@ p the application settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
using the default speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ acting properties set .
use of the pass@@ able speaker , which has all the features of a furnished speaking driver . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ats ; the speaker , which is originally set the originally set properties .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties , by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
mark this check@@ box when the property has priority in front of other features . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the version , this will always be treated as a priority feature . you will probably use this property clearly . if you want to specify the attribute language , it is obvious if you know that a specific application form text in another language as being introduced in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of actors , which is equivalent to the follow@@ er below , click on the box button , and then use on speaker , which equals the following .
in this case , 0 is written for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , entry is 0 required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get tra@@ ce@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is shut down and pun@@ ctu@@ ally ; probably , you must still record G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may not have a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another use of music . if I order a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops , one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : leave to open PCM .
on your system , the problem exists that conflicts with AL@@ SA are appearing to prevent the same opening of multiple PCM devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice from the Internet . I have installed it and can use them in Festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
to add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fru@@ ct@@ int / vocals add to the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; to which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the map audio , there is a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; read either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML re@@ shaping filter , and put the speaking speed up .
I do not create that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ats , reads the web pages with a male voice ago .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so festival no mistakes produced , the x@@ sl file raises the x@@ sl file to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same is also true for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own character set filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no longer a wh@@ aling business or go back . on the cart@@ on , orders will be displayed only from a proposition . what am I doing wrong ?
inter@@ actions ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ one ) are not allowed to filter out . use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )

some users are living in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music simultaneously and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ops , even if you want a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand @-@ up in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you order a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set is still pending .
the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general attitude of the speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included .
you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar absor@@ bing archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time @-@ free movement of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free after direc@@ tives of Deb@@ ian distribution ) , the configure parameter indicates the configure parameter , which causes excessive consideration .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ops are installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS , you need to specify as a --@@ pre@@ fix = target .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions that you get syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations during dis@@ closure .
this voice sets Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software into a festival / li@@ b / vocals / russian . if you enter the Russian votes , you need to set up a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) code , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; lin@@ ux distribution format . therefore , you are looking for a first message to the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the en@@ coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the en@@ coding must be set on an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ syn@@ thesizer , then Festival le@@ x@@ icals analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated from it the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; program and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from

this manual describes the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ control centre ; that enables the administration of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ control centre ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single integrated , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control centre ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Centre ; displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their driver must have already functioning properly and configured , thus &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and the custom@@ ization of the network properties are enabled .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for the network hardware and other devices to install and installed . network appliances later added , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
module network settings will be loaded when selecting the network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ Centre ; -@@ index is selected . when starting the module , this module tries to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the number is offered . it is the platform used to select the distribution of distribution and Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting non @-@ once @-@ demand , the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pre@@ set automatically .
modify the network settings are only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can proceed to the right bottom of the module . it &apos;s the input of password required .
the module &apos;s full functionality is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three riders :
the tab network interface provides management of the network &apos;s network tools . all available network devices are displayed . the following functions can be carried out by the tab network interface :
set up network interface settings can set up by selecting the required device in the list and click the button on the button . set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button on the button Advanced settings displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the choice of automation , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be carried out for the system . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP Server will be required . in the selection list may be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection manual , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address you have to specify the desired TCP / IP address .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface in the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on if required . switching on each network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch on a activated network device is performed by selecting from the list and click interface .
the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net defines the physical connection to remote networks and will be used as standard for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if computers are more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS is dis@@ solves this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8,@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator to the name resolution part of the riding solution enables a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and incre@@ ment@@ or for gra@@ dation in the list with kno@@ cking up or her@@ under in the priority .
by clicking on the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog for the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
first , enter the DNS server address and then click on the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It will be the dialog Edit .
the list of in@@ corporate hosts describes the computer @-@ to @-@ IP address mode for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in the bo@@ oting when there is no DNS servers available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNA servers .
normally the list is well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported . this is still the same version of IP should replace 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Edit .... The dialog will add the new alias is displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host computer , and click the button to add . if the well @-@ known hosts has several alias names , adding button to add several times and enter the alias name .
select one entry of a well @-@ known host computer from the list and choose Edit .... The dialog is printed on the computer .
it can be done with the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings specified in module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , it must be set in a &amp; console ( the following command ) .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; it &apos;s htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s simply download the rpm package and will install in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm , as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool can be used .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE is sufficient ; not , but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended to comp@@ ile users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; it should make the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology are given , in the second all files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files .
this area can &apos;t alter further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 4 has never found great spread . IPv6 is expected in the near future . therefore , this description is concent@@ rating on the spread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is as@@ certain@@ ed . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to view or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when you use a own ( home ) network , IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below will not be for@@ warded to the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course access to internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gate .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used for smaller networks . the area is large enough for networks , up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all the machine participants are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route that is second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the standard route is needed for the IP re@@ direc@@ ting .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally the address is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files you are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes altered at DSL connections , so it is not surprising when in the case of active DSL connections , another content is defined to be found there .
for &amp; SuSE ; is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . otherwise , another stand is expected .

it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ Press@@ ure dialog . if you choose to check out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printing dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have expanded per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the sched@@ ules of the user .
a PO@@ SI@@ X con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX for example , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ uses for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to a quick , selective explo@@ ding . the second target was the answer of a question that my wife said : how much longer it takes you to secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and reads the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the check@@ box on the tape does not , you &apos;ll be asked whether the tape is to be form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; dat ; the check@@ box , searches after the appropriate index on your plate . cannot be found , you will be asked whether the band index should be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol of tape drives , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched for the band by folding the entry .
prior to the throw of the banana , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; seen by a change in the symbol for the band that the integration is solved for the band , and will be displayed in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be kicked off without any danger .
before a band from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a band@@ aging have to form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not match the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; it needs to be form@@ at@@ ted before you can form@@ at@@ ted from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; however , it is intended to form@@ at@@ ted a form@@ att@@ ing of the tape ahead , DA@@ T drives .
after entering the tape name , and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the band . all data on the tape are lost , the tape becomes automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup , you need to select the careful files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . only this file or the folder will be saved .
mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
mark files in local file tree with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select the backing menu ...
once the backup has been introduced , the dialog can open to backup . in this dialog , you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog can be backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select one file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click here with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the test menu .
once the test procedure was started , the dialog setting for checking . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears to verify the progress of testing , as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can enter the rest@@ oring , the files that are to be restored , must be selected . this can be done on two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bun@@ ch . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog automatically appears to restore . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , the dialogue will be re@@ produced . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ xes by using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can add the index to two types of tape :
a f@@ use profile with the straight @-@ selected files and the default settings will be created . you can make the following settings for an ensuring profile :
the current work folder , in which the backup should take place . the list of over@@ seen files will automatically be updated automatically .
for all folder , which are listed under backup files , the files that are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . file , which are stored on other file systems , can be viewed separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental Backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used . only the files that have changed ever since .
the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since last year &apos;s cre@@ denti@@ als .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is used .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the Settings menu via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... set up in the Settings menu . the following settings can be set :
the full path to the device node for tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must as@@ sign on the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape .
if this setting is active , transfers &amp; dat ; before the tape is bound to load the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
the option has been switched on , tries to lock and lock ; perhaps this attitude will not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option at Flo@@ ppy @-@ streaming .
if the option is switched on , tries to change &amp; dat ; the hard@@ war@@ ding block size can change for tape drive . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , writes a file at the beginning of the band . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , where the host name is the complete name of the system , on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that was form@@ at@@ ted since the era in which the band was form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU / tar . even other tar versions should work unless there is no incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup . this icon is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where you can get information about your system or where the system is running the various protocol files . moreover , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log is enabled ; experienced users have quick access to information on problems related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your calcul@@ ator is doing in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system is depos@@ ited on the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log spl@@ its ; experienced users have quick access to information on problems related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore try to deliver some extended functions to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with their help to filter the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol @-@ file easily and sort out . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the system tries to open the system log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system log . will not appear to you with a small news window , so you have &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very probably not with system @-@ foot@@ ed . the protocol files are normally found in the folder / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter for a chosen crit@@ eri@@ on or in the default settings . in the default settings the drop @-@ line will be displayed next to the selected filter . then , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contained the string of the filter search criteria .
you can also select another entry at this point of course . the string of the filter search term will then select the column process only with entries in the chosen column . select the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines sent from this process or have been created .
this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a significant color as protocol lines of the level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off options .
if you want only to display certain process ( e.g. in the System@@ protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification process ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a certain command as such as the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to view all new addition to the new protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows for displaying more protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website based on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the source sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also find in the following folders of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for controlling the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is why it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to enter into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone may try to implement a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and new format . that &apos;s why you must be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differ from the BSD content that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at the peak of the system or when switching to another Run@@ time . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not enough use for it . you can also try a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for the program in@@ it and starts the first he will find .
the standard run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can repair / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab of hand and change the 3 . if you have done something through , then you will repair it by restart the system and run :
but how does it start with all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written that there is a argument like starting and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts under the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script will be called to the argument . if it includes an S , the script will start using the argument .
some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; can also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other hand @-@ set is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Run@@ es to start at this level ( or stop ) .
you can shift scripts out between Run@@ ners or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the availability of the available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you select this in a new range . in order to copy it only to a new Run@@ level , you need to select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action .
the sorting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting order numbers of the ren@@ dering entries before attempting to add the system service .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the various work@@ places ( Available System services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting code or the name of one entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the tab button to accept the input button , to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . for default , they are produced by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ r@@ c .
I have been experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ ners , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter on the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution of distribution .
the way , such as system services can be launched in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distri@@ butions , but alas no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution box : please verify that all configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) just stop without message when their configuration files are not present or in@@ correct .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send us information about Run@@ es , so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the Chapter Adju@@ st@@ ment of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have done any changes , you have to save them . either you use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window is made of two card cards , the user group and user group list . to edit the user or the desired group with double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only displayed if you have done advanced system settings . only if you can make customized system settings . for example , if you can make customized settings ( Qu@@ ota ) , you will make custom settings . other card cards appear , if shadow passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed as in BSD portable devices .
the card password will appear if shadow passwords , or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d installed as in BSD -@@ uni@@ forms .
this card card only appears if for at least a embedded file system space limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( can be seen here for any user parameters , but the number of limitations in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field of space constra@@ ints
the Card group provides information on the group of selected users . the standard group , which belongs to the user , will be found in the Pri@@ m@@ eric Group box . furthermore , the user can become member in other groups by marking these in the big field .
the group &apos;s dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select addition to the user or group or click on the matching button in the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the li@@ lo Boot@@ manager , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to the default operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change and more .
