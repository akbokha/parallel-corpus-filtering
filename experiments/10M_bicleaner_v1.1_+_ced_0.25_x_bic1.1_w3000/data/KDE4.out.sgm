<seg id="14">The particularity of & FSView; consists in it, embelled folder with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object should be smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a file or folder is reflected in the size of the size of the entries. in this way, large files can be detected, even if it can be easily detected in the folder hierarchy. according to that & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have a reasonable color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on color mode, can be either depth for the easy detection of the pollution-depth or the image of another file association like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can define whether it is at all indicated, only then, if enough space available to display, or whether the area of subordinate right-angles should be used (whereby it is possible to define the relative position of lettering in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">When algorithms for Treemaps should generally be observed, that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be available. note that less space is lost for frames if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a split of the area of the area is provided for the subordinate entries, the implementation will be left. here it is beneficial to the labeling and avoidance of space losses due to parameters that are possible to be square. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns, or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum shown surface for an entry on the menu entry view. instead, an Rautensample is drawn into the area of the above-level entry to indicate that this surface is actually covered by a subordinated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; as a small testing application and introduction into the use of the TreeMap Widget intended for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digial; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital kamerase.gPhoto2 is a free, non-distributable software collection for digital cameras, which was developed by a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras. it allows the transfer of digital cameras to host and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general are big files and transmission over the serial port is slow, this connection is now dated. & digial; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with gPhoto2. you will find a complete list of supported cameras on this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto 2 needs to have been created with libexif support. the EXIF support is required of some libgphoto2 camera models. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might have imagined it, or the creation could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday images can be found fast over your location. if you do have enough photos on the same place. if you make enough photos, you'll be able to use subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant intake of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% are working and you will then not want to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. split new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata options in the installation page of metadata in & digial; this ensures that exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what changes? in addition, a metadata Editor is available for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should select any photo keywords, moons and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keyword, key words, as you are often called in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged pictures from another source with embedded keywords, then it is added; automatically the tree for you add the pictures to the right spot. the conversion of the Hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by removing a sub-building on one another. the changed keywords are being updated by & digial.</seg>
<seg id="160">The chart shows how different metadata designs itself. this is a very rough representation, since each block consists of metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data refer to all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments, the third important tool to detect your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to see most of your photos simply look, they want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are safe to see how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you'll see some details to see people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this is the landing area of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after the landing. Wow! one starts to dream to have associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may possibly even hear the silence. the lettering has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others that consider your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to create a story. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is the importance to view to Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's fine if a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digial; you can specify a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet. KDE even export a spell checker for you. if you export your pictures into web galleries and then you will have to tell the story of the Web-gallery. so you have to tell the story for opening a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already using light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by geolocation are already incalculable. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeater your journeys by pictures with geographic data. you can also see the pictures at reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; copyleft is a word game with copyright and refers to the practice of use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also to the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information comes in the setup page of & digial; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for writer and authors): this field ought to add your name, or the names of the photographers, for example to protect the photographers name, then the name of a company or organization is not to be changed. this field supports neither commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for Constitutional Line): linked to the author. examples include the author of the photographer. examples of this field can be titles like: employee photographer, free photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is a memo of car field, it must be filled as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for distributors): use the Anbieterfield to identify who is offering that. if the photographer works for a News Agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is an image photo, then the group / agency is given the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer, can only delete the solution for this problem, digital watermarks. for individuals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important against it.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digial; it will provide a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turnout errors, power cut, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterflection, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have lost on the streets or a fire. this kind of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negative. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the world's largest database development company, has some interesting statistics which has a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated for longer than a few years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archival quality, which are longer more difficult to get more difficult, and more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece for a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your messaging room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices. the best DVD recording device are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you're getting much reliable. therefore, it's about the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to mistakes, even if you were just written. therefore, they use a control unit mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control hum. despite this massive protection it alates through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a favourable program called Isobuster. it works on Windows and Linux; but it is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications which damage damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the format's format of HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that's been said to CDs and DVDs, also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow down with a good recording device to qualitatively high-quality media in a non-propriate format. read the media with a description, date & author marking and then on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves. your production guaranteed includes a new disk, but not the data. Google represents a large fieldbus over the error mechanisms of hard drives at your disposal: floordisc</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: Disks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In a lower temperature control, the most common trouble code, SMART may terminate this error. some of the SMART errors are to terminate the immediate failure. these are particularly readers and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is a total loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also loss data loss due to a blackout before you have backed up the files, but these losses are usually able to recover without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment is not much less, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed sprouts. these can cause serious damage. at your machine, these anomalies can cause damage, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect themselves from the inevitable that will lead to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">Most widespread protection against rapids is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy-heat and the rest is grounded. however, it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember that not any plug-in system also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should consider that it guarantees the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention that it protects against lightening and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should note that even all peripherals are connected to your system. some manufacturers are also able to make a overvoltage for your modem. some manufacturers offer connectivity to your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable fashion and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore you are very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of unbreakable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in a disruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overload, these devices can automatically expose your data automatically. some models allow you to keep up your data until the stream is running again. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they are getting the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. moreover, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Don't worry about the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare up to euro; 20 cost, A 500W USV can get you for less than & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be protected for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you are protecting your computer with it. at the end, you are always thinking about drinking all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as the backup goal for your software. Google Shared storage is a further popular offering with any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives too. however, very expensive - 40 GB cost per dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. moreover, you need to send data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but there is no general backup solution. this is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com make online storage services available to photos. your free memory is available at 1 GB and you will not have any more photos available, in the case by Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, web solutions are very safe. data transfer errors are automatically adjusted instantly with the TCP protocol and the large firms use a backup and a parcel storage. therefore, they are desasterably.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are due to transmission errors. the file system is required at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says that if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain untroubled until you have no protection in your hardware. no one seems to have any protection for it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable mains parts are another source for transfers, as they generate interfaces within the data stream. these errors remain unnoticed in normal filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmissions problems, you should look into the future. already 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with turntables on lower level and can be highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its bypass file system. this is still in the alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms for use and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% for job systems. in Notebooks, the proportion of theft can be 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss because of viruses is less common than most. it leads to a lower damage, than for instance, theft or new installations. and it is currently based on Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been no longer sighted anymore.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS was minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to give the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examining process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem was lost, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human defects are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras are 1-2 aperture setting of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that during the technology, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and sound characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far removed from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are heading towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if these resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is optimised for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; thus, you are not able to hit any other for data loss. thus, you make sure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make some dangerous just like the new installation of your operating system, replacing plates or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accident: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole space or entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desiring is always a not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs into the neighbouring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as above, it is a common cause for a data loss in spite of backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files changed since the last complete system. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the full-full backup and the latest differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of files changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time back on which one such backup has been made. this backup comes with a versioning system the next with the exception which is only fasted and not continuously.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that can easily be set up on your machine. unlike script controlled FTP sessions, or other types of file transfer encryption, rsync only copied the difference of files that really changed. this happens and if you would like to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back important images directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or a different optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moment for at least one month and a moment for each month. every additional dilution should be done manually according to which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinventing pictures and metadata, copy the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Thus valuable images will survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of its nature, all of you have to look with caution while time flies. unfortunately, there is no other possibility to be compatible with caution. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself as the current system backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered according to the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. if you have an old system that's important for reading your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and fuse technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the ability to change a system in its size. it actually means to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with set up and put the range that you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and go to a new plate:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, whether your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDC # Source is / dev / SDC / SDC # Source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MB2,3; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS; change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day doesn't exist any software there is, then you can create it yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard for GIF. but it can be lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use gamma- and chromatiality data for improved color instruction, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression. this format we would recommend to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a low-loss compressionism (Defend). however, there is a problem that this format has been adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licensed-free and open resource image that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the requirements of metadata. a handful camera manufacturer provides DNG already now and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is probably one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mix of XML and RDF. it is a file information containing the extension & quot; .xmpquot; is stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in the rough format. XMP fits in addition to the link between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the shell-format is drawn up separately. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of purposes and business models. for the activities of DCMI, work on architecture and modelling, discussions and communal work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as pictures on the camera order, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohlofiles to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine processing, you can use external programs. once you come back with & digial pictures, then you should add the metadata once again. these have been cut apart from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it in Webgaleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact covers, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digial. in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description, as you can already add on your hard disk. but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your albendental bank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; connect this with the machine, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it down. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect it to your camera. if the connection is made, a pre-indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras don't present file names and a symbol for the file association for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to download camera information about any entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that with some digital cameras don't all know any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata, such as EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as in the metadata page bar from the main window of & digial; or the picture format. note that these metadata is not available at some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then the photos from their camera into a single album in & digial; with downloading the photos are not deleted, and we recommend you check the pictures safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos you want to select the default optional methods of & KDE; select the button you want to download and then download the selected button. the button is grayed as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is available for download. these pictures have been downloaded here yet not by & digial; in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in front window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons all download or chosen files, a dialog box can be found in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder, displayed in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digial; download the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete these from the camera. you can delete all at once, by removing the button extinguishing all. if you only want to delete a few, you need to select them first and then remove delete ID.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore images from the camera. you should not verify that if the photos were successfully deleted in a & digial; they should be carefully deleted if you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera's camera, you should read this about the camera's memory, as this is much quicker.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful, after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can be done to double file names if you have photos of different superviseries in the same album. so it can be useful, the date and time when the image was made to integrate the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirrors of the image and date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, it will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options while the transmission opens up three more options, which are conducted before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want to use a different date format as the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% S. if you need to add the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the option to change the file name in lowercase. or, in case letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; used for a photo, is indicated below the name indicating the camera in the preview mode. your settings are stored and automatically used, if you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">Digiplug; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to perform an automatic rotation at the time frame. not all cameras put this information ready. in the section page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera into the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver these information, you can adjust the picture in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the button extension and select the automatic rotation in the bottom range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera is made information about the date on which the photo was made available, you can create & digiplug. all images with the same date are provided in the same sub-album. all images with the same date will be provided in the same sub-album. not all cameras points this information available. in the section page bar meta data you can read which information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case stores & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to expand this option. use the button extension and select the option of date-based subalbums at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from their machine to their camera is the button to download. select the file extensions dialog & KDE; you can also select the files you are uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is done, ask & digiplug; you, where the images should be uploaded into. select a folder dialog for the camera. select OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. this is a position of what can be displayed in longitude and latitude. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers could link it interesting to link an image with a precise distribution site. not everyone uses a plane to cartographic the area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural office and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten the photo, where exactly the photo has been made, you can click with one click to open the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digial user, or want to locate the location the location of the photo is to contribute to the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how are the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has a lot of GPS data, such as the direction, traction and map reference. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via reworking the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual), and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a couple who work with GPS recipients together. either as a map module or by transferring the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel only. however, you need to save these data in GPX format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from pictures and GPS. on the following page you can extract the same under & linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that uses the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the predictated coordinates using the example of maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">Digiplug; try to give you so much control over its work procedures as possible. there are many settings that have to access to the behaviour of the digiplug. in order to set up these settings, you have to switch to the Settings menu. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Selecting action can display embedded preview or image editing can be set. you specify the default behavior of & digial; firm, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option is selected to download from the camera's interface. this data is also written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. these can be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this gives a more detailed description of the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this must not be the author here if this is listed for a news agency as such as Reuters or Associated Press. if the picture is a photo photo, then the group or agency will be available here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC-rim. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digial. these metadata is also available other programs and can be imported in & digial; imported without losing.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image uses as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG image: this synchronizes the comments you will add to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. this way, your labels will also be read by other images, they are overwritten by the digitization.</seg>
<seg id="290">The settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer in the main window over a file, depending on selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digial; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to fix, which file types & digial, you can add the file extensions to this list and remove. Albumordner, who has none of these extensions, has been ignored by & digial; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by press the button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The flag of the luminance of digiplug; can be set on this page on the default values. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. option & quot; In the whole image file ladenquot; if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing is used in a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select this tool here. you can turn the tool bar when you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Overexposed and underexposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image editing, this visible mode can be adjusted with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the pictures will be encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG files, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG use a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value on a high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files, you can switch defend -compressionletm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it doesn't have an impact on image quality, since the defect is due to loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can select lossless. even if you select the loss of loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. as this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digial; the image processing is only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it is developing a very fast tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default setting is that all green pixels are equal to ultra-violet light. if you use this option, this difference is somewhat soft, eliminates this problem with a minimal rate of details. this option shows the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 grate pattern with VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the bald will use the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the bald is not set. standard is a solid colour balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors it has the effect that exposed images in four steps have more details in the shlichens. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the nickname, so the parts of your images are burned, as passing through the inability of your camera to view the top-out white in the settings. use some unusual results since it shows the shlichter in various rosis. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the spurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible as blue pixels in general not so quickly filling like green and red. & digial; and dcrav therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still saturated blue pixels. of course this is a matter of how many color or white they want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set him a bit higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image files that have many cameras and that is also known as a Matrix-colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or colour structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digial; and Dcraw have three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it was produced as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity) was the first algorithm used by Dcrav. however, it produces color artefacts to the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color copy of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correctants here. this is certainly the best method for color-soft correction, as you will be carried out during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as this should be given. there are also LCMS and digiplug; information such as the color information from an color space in the others are to be translated with the colors as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">If a picture in image editing is open / color management module with shell files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile stewards Find here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC in which you can store all your profiles. & digial; examines this folder during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; standard squot; can be reset to your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the shell file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colouring not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profile should match the camera manufacturers and model you don't fit. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain dytonmapping or gammacortur. currently, dcraw Gamma not have to do for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the color mapping themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-proof-profile, which you can emulate how your picture would print a smaller colour range as your printer can have a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated with you, instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obvious to suit the colour profile for them. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, there is a table of cameras and profiles to fit together. this answer is obviously unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion makes the style recognize: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitund S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & KDE; features and digitization: many modules have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. choose the modules that you want to use and these are then loaded by & digiplug. these modules appear as new entries in menu of the main window and additionally you will find some in the context menu of the preview menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-commands for tasks that can be done by modules, can be set in the menu below the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be accessed via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugin.org or the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other attackers switch off the metadata, or off, which are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right, there is a button automatic detection, which is being connected to the computer. if you want to use it, make sure the camera is connected. currently, there are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage camera. this field is only active when you have a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera type. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / them, on which you hang your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer, display them in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digiplug; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any particular note for your camera. this is displayed in the main menu's menu cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>

<seg id="337">Digiplug; contains a rapid image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view and correction and improvement. the image processing can be started using a click with the left mouse button to preview / Edit menu and selection of the updated ads / processor.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. so, some of them are available as modules in & digial. so, you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including tool bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using file stores or button stores from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo as soon as you have stored the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should install a copy of your image before you change it. this can you do with file stores.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't stored the photo, you can restore the original label by repeating or edit the button The button restoration of image editing in the tool bar. you then lose every change that you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action you can reverse, by selecting editing and select Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should select the key combination, Ctrl; -z to reverse and reproduce Ctrl; -resp-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; you can press a moment longer, and select a console menu in the tool, receive a console menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made any changes on current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can go in and out in the photo, in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the command menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the tool: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you will also enter the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can change it from the digiplug dialog. you can view this in the digiplug dialog. see the section on setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, select the image and select the standard & KDE; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. all image files can be printed out of your selection. you only need to select pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album exporting print assistance. if you follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiplug; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, the important information and actions for selected images available. the same sidebar is available, without the navigation splitter, also available in image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is on display:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same riders make the sidebar appear and disappear again in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the inscription view, you can insert inscription with unlimited size or insert. note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are allowed in the EXIF- and IPTCs fields so that you can use some other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are enmoulded. if you want to use the IPTC in other applications, please note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the button to apply or simply switch to the next image, the labels are stored.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from selected file or database. however, you can also read the metadata settings. this will always be selected if you have written a metadata settings.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section assessment shows an evaluation scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouseclick on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keycliff trl + 0... 5. the rating from the sidebar is always applied only to one image, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written into the IPTC field. encoding follows the pattern in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword below shows a search box to filter words, the keyword tree and a selection box with previously in this & digial; session announced.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adjusted dynamically. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many passwords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is another relief when typing the keyword on a series. if you have entered various keywords, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set up by marking the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. all keywords are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several pictures have been selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the section called Keyword filters.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword is used to change the selection of the displayed images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar will be used with their album, - data, keyword and search results. if additionally, one or more keyword filter is used from the right-hand side, only the cut of these two will be displayed. all mentioned keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and dismantle them. if the keyword is already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it onto the selection. as a result, a dialog box that asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example shows the main window the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is indicated on no markings, which amount to three images. they were drawn with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and placed there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">These search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off by default settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or should, you can easily change this with double click on the text and the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, looking for the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name, or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can select an extension of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping to use. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr were not listed? the free memory space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you set a colourfully-administered workflow that will actually have a predictable deviation from the actual shot or scanned colors. with a colorfully redesigned workflow, you can achieve that the colors will print on your screen from your camera or scanners to print them or in the web to those coming from your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme goes on color management, everybody wants to know what buttons it does need for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense does make you make proper background information about color management. in addition, links with lower information enable you to make your own informed decisions to make you desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your photo workflow meets all six criteria below, you must not take care of color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are working on a monitor that calibrated on the sRGB color space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other education expenditures are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and the life for all so easy, why should one then use another color space and how to make thoughts about color towers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huh-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color flowers, so visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site, and then click on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work on the sRGB color space or not, you need to install your monitor. if you have to work on sRGB on sRGB, you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available, which can improve the image in most cases. therefore, use a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, balance, automatic and contrast extend from the menu corrected automatic correction automatically from your colors to make the best. you will be experimenting with these effects, to see what is best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scalates leukemia over the whole picture, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing his color shaded. this function is often a magician correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">In the same way, this method is adjusted to the illuminants of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible. by this way, the comparing very good results achieved in the improvement of the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation incurred in a picture or were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes colour range in red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels in the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of a picture by the postpone of the lowest and highest levels in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The bald comparison of & digial; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white comparison of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly limited because of an colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can walk far from the original image, in case you can perform the white right in the body mode, which will work in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction shall be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-balm-balm of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start with the menu entry of colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left-hand side the original image as well as the preview of the goal is adapted. if you want to watch the original protein settings, then it is enough to click on the lower window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the luminance of the Pixels under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">On the right above, a histogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful as, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. the sum will be called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow layouts of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat can be used with the above checks, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press on this button and then anywhere on the pictures to use the colour temperature of the white-size. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the bald immediately with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator rises the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. every adjustment of the white-comparison you can now store in a text file and reload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings will return all filter values again to its standard values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will be made another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding yeast per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit coding is better for high quality images. however, this coding requires even more disk space, calculating time and stands only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be carried out by the underwindow for the helmets. a detailed manual for the use of color profiles can draw the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu in color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated route to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always need the same mistakes and therefore you will always need the same correction. in the manual for pitch correction, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool colour defects provides you four colour defects, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filters.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of the chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that developed partly developed pressure of a brief flashlight and followed the development of the image. this result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approximately 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase is finally generated a negative image that is not to be produced on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation, that it makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, he embellert many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a daylight optimised colour movie produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contrasts. Velvet offers strongly saturated colour but also some photographer, especially those who have hardly any landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">Neoners simulates Neonlight at the contrast edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neonlight. for large images, the filter is able to load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it's not unusual that you want to correct the contrast contrast and luminosity of your photos with the tools in the menu. once you are satisfied with the results you can use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo with bad light conditions. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice for saturation instead of increasing it. all changes that you can perform in preview can you confirm the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex set of gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma, the tool is very complicated to improve the exposure of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you need for the field of sliding purposes only. specifically, the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window includes a graph of the intensity values, an histogram, active canals or the selected area. under the graphs, three sliders are clicked into the picture and which can be moved to change the intensity of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to postpone the control and make sure how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand you can view the original and preview of the image. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this select box can be set if the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic organization is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium sounds, often called Gammaili.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush paces can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shade, middle and bright tones automatically. furthermore, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers used to change the output values, e.g. for example, to create a slight picture as a background, while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this knob, image values are automatically set in depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: these buttons can be stored in the file system and subsequently loaded again. the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pids, the input will automatically be adjusted automatically for all shade, means and sun sets. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposed points controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and indicate the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in preview, and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input data applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the correct picture (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the originals and the target pattern is displayed. the preview will be updated automatically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this selection box allows the channel to be modified from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. most of the linear mode, linear mode, linear mode, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a trip to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones should be considered with dark procurement and that are darker and darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">At the preview of the original photos is a red markings to see. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, the right line is displayed on the curve. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every bend you have created can be saved and subsequently loaded in filesystem. the file format is the Gimp package format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colorpids buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sunburn. activate the color pipette which you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposed indiator controls all colour channels to indicate overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. here, you get the effect only in preview, and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo which has been corrected in the Luminance channel. shadow and Sonnentöne was applied using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original pattern (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The canal-blender of the digiplug; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or modify the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colour tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by clicking the relative allocation and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview of your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable Luminance, it is particularly practical if you want to reduce the color components. this is especially convenient if you want to reduce the color tool to create great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color is coming to a visible sound that comes from farbrauschen and does not look at the same point in color channel and their space pattern is different in any channel different. if that's the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion thereby in which you can reduce the colour-color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any pender setting can thus be saved and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposed points controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and indicate the combined outcome of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect just in preview, and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the image shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as pictures can be easily converted to the machine. also with a set of film rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Stop 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good for all sceneries and fits especially well to portraits in the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfiltered: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photographs. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) orange film.</seg>
<seg id="454">Roter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate beam distance from the time of the day. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) RotFilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones in the shakes. this is very similar to the process of curd of a print and redevelopment in a sepia. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">You can apply decorative textures on a picture with the & digiplug; tool texture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu input picture texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the depth or three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Texture.com has been applied on the picture below. the original picture is (1) and modified (2). relief parameters has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">The digiplug; tool frame is adding a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of an observation in the boundaries of a photo is not a easy task. an opportunity to keep its attention is to put a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to watch the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you have the desired frame type for your image. penetrating the image with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and white images), it comes with a nice three-dimensional frame that makes it ideal for a bone effect and decoratively adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: gives the width of the frame in percent. the range for the width is between 1% and 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert easy to formatted text in an image at any location. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and use it with the mouse. use text excerpt, orientation, colour from the color space and character set with its properties. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set should be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any adjustment you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press on the button "OK," after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">You can apply a template on a picture with the & digiplug; tool template.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Templates apply in the image processing can be used to put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compressing (9) to comparison the template of file size; please send an email to the & digitization; Mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your template with the button basic file in the dialog. select the folder in which you select the template. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder made for the stencils, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil template. the selection of a folder gives the template of the template.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. if you want to use the mouse button. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you need to scatter the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your picture. the image will be adjusted automatically the preference size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digial. has three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to look a sharper. actually, it is not a bit of psychological. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapours and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken out of Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refording is probably the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its use and has different parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the end of the digitizing process to be put together with a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras will usually need more retrograde than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image a camera is often applied to internal sharpening. images in the rough format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply for sharpness already during reading the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get usable results by setting up a photo with the sharpening value. you can adjust with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should deal with caution when the results do not seem very naturally: sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the useful technique is used to adjust the tool refusal. you will find further information and comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. use the tool to correct soft drawing with the menu entry. use the tool to soften and experiment with settings. the default window on the right side of the dialoges show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter imsharp is a very good tool to remove grinding of your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help edit the picture. the default window shows the output of the filters with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. default values are often good results and should be tried first. an increase of radius or viewer can intensify the effect. if you generate the insharpness of the mask, noise and impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges are to be created.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels appear on each side of an edge through the filters. high resolution images allow larger radio. you should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final solution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image, which is added to the original. therefore, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. it can therefore define a minimum difference for an edge of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones is excluded and therefore flaw in faces, heavens and water surface.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filters. the original picture is the (1) and the painted picture (2). insharp mascate was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refrain refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyright protected filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to use a picture to & quot; re-focused approach than just trying to defuse the photo. it is used to use a technique named FIR Viennese Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a nonslip mask. you can start from the menu by simply retrieving colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular manner does not work much better than the Gauss's folding. the Gauß 's folding a very long tail, which leads far from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is influenced in most cases even very strong from remote pixels, which causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular clarity: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameters for use of this module. for most pictures, the default value is 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture should be very sharp then on halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation is to help minimise artifacts. the correlation is reduced from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, and eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase of the smoking filter may help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 is only rarely useful. if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is added to the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness is' sch '. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to raise the correlation and / or the smoking filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines good results for the size of transformation matrix. however, an increase of the matrix size can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. every Refracecing parameter has been set to be stored for later and then can be charged.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave later unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading images and press compressing, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, insharp masquerade produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by insharp mating a bigger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it has to produce insharp mating always artefacts. for the Viennese filter you can show that it is the optimal lens filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least just as good as the insharpest mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small-focused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image has to be corrected. this picture was taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The decomers defies the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour-tinte allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool, to remove non-desired artifacts with unpielloser speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the riders and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed information p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a smaller value leads to a smooth glass of smooth regions of smooth and detail. a value of 0.9 should receive details that no sharpening should be necessary. note that the details preservation should always be ordered.</seg>
<seg id="520">Seal dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions; if you have a value near 1 only in one direction only. if you have a filming or CCD, a high value of wave-like pattern will produce a high value of similar patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be best eliminated at a value of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor via allot. p then defines the relative glasses. therefore, put this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter applies greater structures. the higher this value is placed, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulent effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will run through. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Anisotropic [5, 90]: anisotropic integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be selected as well. make sure that small angle produce a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glancing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubles but the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast in work. but it can take a long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the demolition button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how pictures to be corrected as small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black flaw in the background that caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is below (1) and shown the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">Die & digial; Smoking production is a very powerful tool to reduce image sequences. it uses an copyright protected algorithm from Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable images filters to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. of dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensing from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about Sensorraughts by digital cameras, you can read this tutorial in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene featuring a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the lower window details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time that the filter is needed per pixel and can pave the picture above the picture and the color in it is smoothed and with smaller flaws.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of sharpness. this value sets the pixel pitch to verify the filter changes. if it is increased, smokers should change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and rude or lubricate once more.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong it can't be removed or smoke tips can occur. put it at a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak or JPEG Artefacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings don't influence the smoothing process that controls details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either colour or luminance to improve the image. these settings don't influence the smoothing process that controls details of the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemulation of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas, typically stronger, but also the shadow sections.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius can occur if it is too high can occur. if it is up to its minimum, noise and phasenjitter appear at the edges. it can remove smokes and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for roduction, which you have set, can be stored in the file system and subsequently loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected (2), with the standard input was applied to standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is a crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the image is a bit soft to varnish with the menu entry. use the tool to soften and experiment with the gluten. use the effect on the right side of the dialog page showing the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Die & digial; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photography files.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesired artefacts of your pictures. he is very well adapted for digitalization, scratches, compression artefacts and local bugs in digital, original or retrograde digitalised images. thereby, the smoothing is done along the educational institutions and thereby gets the content of the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture is developed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frannate and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it creates some compression & quot; Artefakatquot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and loading are exactly this. every setting of photo restoring may be stored in a text file and subsequently loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoring is comparatively very fast in work. but it can take a long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can see how a photo with equitous noise can be restored. the module is applied on a black and white photo that with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the correct one (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures was applied on an old colour picture which has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which have been shown by scanning light and photopapier. the original picture is below (1) and shown the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digitization (tool hotpixel) allows hotpixel photos that have been fitted with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels represent especially high quality raw mode, because many cameras have JPEG compression via a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; name is Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; there is currently no manual method to select the poor pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you can connect the dark picture directly to the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and reload this automatically in the next meeting again.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview can help you correct the results within the picture. the file showcase shows the output of the filters with the current settings. bad pixels are emphasized in all foresight areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the faulty pixels at the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durlet: it is an average of the neighbouring pixel size. the resulting color will be assigned to all defective Pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linearly: all pixels represent a distance between 1 pixel block (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). then, these are used to interpolishing the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are moved to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim) or a batch of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels represent a distance of 3 or less, to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below, you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, made of a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original picture was enlarged to 300% (1) and the correct picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The diginetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetc, i.e. exposed corners, to correct a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Distance objects, especially in the middle and large photo format, can often not be able to illuminate the whole sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image, by reducing the light to the sensor there. teleject systems may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. lots of center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with hand. a wide angle lens should also be used, also with center-filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller than otherwise insharpening effects are created by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great exposures of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulating a equivalent transformation at a rough image that is used without this filter. the tool is used for a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">Check the Vignetting correction filter with three shelves, and with three additional exposures to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of lightest absorption at the point of the largest density the filters. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate the density of a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstärke, contrast, and gamma settings: the processing of a picture with the Vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of pixels. you will need to adjust the exposure of the target image using these options. the controllers will only provide positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more sensitive new adjustment of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / Contrast / Gamma near zero and use the gradation of the & digitization; image processing derived from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the correct image. a denal and contrast correction was also carried out with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colourless distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">Coefficient of the second degree covers the overall geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but laughs at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">Coefficient of fourth Grades corrects the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values may be corrected, and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth degree. this value seems to be stronger than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' marked the opposite number of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scalates the image size and leads through a correction of the first gradation by. negative values increase while positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Slighten: adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview allows you to use the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonne or cushion-shaped correction should be carried out before all concision or size changes. in case you perform this correction as all the first. if you cut a picture again and then a ton-shaped correction would be the effect to be apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool represents a vertical and horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important place, such as the ocean side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the ton / cushion distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove these using the cutting tool in the menu transformer, remove from image editing or through the zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonne-shaped correction is enough. the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings are the perspective so correct to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a ton-shaped correction used on a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and shown the correct picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infra-red film of the Gimpguru.org website which is under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can add two parameters of film portrait and film sensitivity. if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator is changing the amount of filming and dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color channels can be used to produce infra-red film, especially the green channel does not make any sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filtrine used on a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the image of the film has been set on ISO 400. higher ISO values create a sort of aura in the spurs.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; filters film production is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturer has large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-sizing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past. if you want to get rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want to release this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grained sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of granularity. the default value is, although higher values are needed, to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filters several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-based effect on a black / white painting. the original picture is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digial; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil mixture. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digial; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large images. smoothing the glass, or from the other side, the sniper.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original pattern is marked with the (1) and it is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640-pixel wide picture is 1 and extant 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digial; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to define a carboneskizze. therefore, images whose gradients are slowly changed for this effect. it is helpful when you would like to sketch out what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator is choosing the default size and the lower adjust the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the recording filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digial; filters engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digial; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works very well with pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey and mondarling landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distortion-effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the picture in the cells, and lets it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelblocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time for calculation and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work artwork using unsharpness effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: get out the picture along globular lines starting from a center. this simulates the sharpening a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial unsharpness: wiped the picture by turning the pixels at a central point. this simulates the sharpening of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances points: get the image to create a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement: distorted the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photography, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft drawing: distorted the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos, or add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaker's sharpness: distorted the image through random shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent invincidents: find the colour in the image and wiped them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the picture in rectangular cells and then created it through the filling with an average pixelvalue.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need long time for calculation and create a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. in this way, it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn urinproof algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows the size of drips to change. since the drop size is not automatically growing with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the drop and density of drops. fish eyes changes the effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digial; image editing a range free of shelves. use the range of tools to stay free, for example, a face that should stay free. if you start the filters Regentropping, the range will be free of shelves.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of regentropping filters. the original sign (1) shows a calm sunset and the painted picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it by mirror or rotating in the proper orientation. the tools you will find in the menu transformers rotating and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">It is definitely one of the most advanced tools in order to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">To shrink a picture is easy. the big question is how can you invent a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you find the missing information here or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size. choose transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for the size change uses a linear interface method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. split pin interpolation for the enrichment of a picture. & digial; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm picture was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep the aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio is set in the original image aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="636">Rule: [0, 100]: this parameter applies greater structures. the higher this value is placed, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulent effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loading are used exactly. every single application for photo can be saved as text file and later reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and a high CPU load after moving. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example for photo overhens by adding a little color on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation, but also an often underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo you need just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and tightening of the rectangle, create. you will see this rectangle you see while mouse is moving.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you start the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. so you can change a good overview like your photo after cutting. you can pull the size of the button by turning on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle you will create with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the section, use the knob button of image editing in the tool bar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File stores under the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the front area, you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool is used to aspect ratio of aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to select the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bottom in the dialog, you can set the Max. relationship button to cut the range on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Following aspect ratio, the settings stored on the aspect ratio (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The help of the support help allow helpers to create your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-level, harmonic triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in a harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden centre is a division based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals leaves of a sunflower. it emerges in all possible things which we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your paintings, buildings and even photographs to give your creatures a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting particle is 1: 1.618 the golden centre. a composition that is usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides liquid relief lines when you produce an image. these helpers are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third party, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetric visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles be used to lead the golden spiral. this can be a line of or different objects. this can be easily removed without the eye, it will fulfill his task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the top-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not an equilateral triangles. diagonal to these lines can be appeared.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles in order to break your frame, you will create a effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try your focus on one of the intersections and other visual information on the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal and vertical mirromirers can be used to mirror harmonious positions.</seg>
<seg id="660">The button color allows you to set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you can't keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things have turned around an angle. you can repair it with the & digial; image processing and tool-free rotation. select transformers free rotation and adjust the target angles.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the firing angle. the default settings are set in degrees. with the default settings, you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the module requires a horizontal and vertical line to position. after you move the mouse pointer in the picture to position the two lines you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is the function transformation from processing of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing makes the image a bit after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All peremptive transformations are carried out in a fixed point where reference point is carried out. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview will then automatically be calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle of degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle of degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle of degrees on the left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes a little smuceful. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've got the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to transfer this is to cut the picture with transformers from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and postpone another part in the opposite. this is no rotation, the image becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module across transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Note your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you push it horizontally and vertically, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of Effective will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line is built. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool button to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the proofing, the picture becomes a little bit wired. for a single shift, this effect is usually negligible but two chasing is doubtless so much swisely and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the proofing, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. a possibility to eliminate this is the image of transformation from the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digial; you need to read and write a number of libraries and other parcels for image formats and, in some cases, from the type like this libraries compiling. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug;</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system, but you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">Digial & digial; shows only files to those who know. this is done using file extension and a comparison of this with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list. if the extension is shown in the list. you can change this list of file extensions and digitization; in section configuration, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select it even the format. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digial; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression technique on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save free-loss when it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge read very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Rohmer Converter of & digitization; you can find further information on the use of modules with & digiplug;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to work in & digial; contain their description here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools like sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refractures, unsharp mating, & etc; use a uniform dialogical type that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below, see & quot; texture applicator; in this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture. on the left of it five buttons allow the comparison chart of the pre-acting command. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization tools are available to localise images geographically in the spherical Coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo, localize the height, longitude and latitude.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GPX format and gpsman you can download and convert your GPS device from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Correlator. this interface may merge a number of selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you correlated to the main window and call the menu on. the above-looking dialog appears. to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file, of course, data collected at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed in red. GPS track data are stored in GMT time and therefore the camera must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. use your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The deviation for the maximum time deviation gives a upper deviation for the GPS period and camera eit. the deviation below is the data collected and the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have trace data from one place for images, you can edit the GPX file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will be correlated all images in this range.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that the reality is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have done a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you just need to use the button OK to put the data on the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found with the displayed map by and to it. choose the relevant region and enlarge you sie.Guide this always through until you have a sufficient accuracy. the card can always be manually changed. the card can be switched between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Complete outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang out the GPS data. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of images using GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages, and specify the parameters for HTML pages. character set will be encoded in UTF-8 to enable a possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted to HTML. you will need to select these albums. the albums are not listed here. the three buttons on the right-hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text is displayed in the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider look defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is extensively self explained. if you click on a picture, a new page will be displayed on each image. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default screen, & eg; Kuishow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery can be saved with all your associated images. select a folder made on which you write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">In case you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider views are allowed to give you some of the settings from the album rider for thumbnails, these are small pictures displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window will show the user how far the action is. press off abrupting the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages it is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program reports to determine if errors are performed during the production. the web browser will be automatically started to preview the preview of the gallery. press and close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rotations, zooming or relocating. the viewer can be used with short commands and coups. it has been designed for fast picture display and quick access to its features.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to alter images without impressing your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to store actions below, to save pictures in JPEG format without the usual losses on quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of low-loss storage is that the file size rises, as no compression of the color information is taking place. this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera customer currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-Imaging @ kde.ordet.: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the KDE-Imaging @ kde.org to the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from a single image to another. select the image from the main program and then call the file extensions dialog with which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you have pushed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look at exiv2, to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG file module is a tool to convert a set of images into a MPEG video in form of maschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG codiers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic screen size. you can also add a audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can create a background colour for the slide. with this module it is possible to use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD to your DVD player. to burn the medicine, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG-Taschau. then you can launch the module with extras-maschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected from you are then listed in the portfolio under image files. there you can also change sorting in the list or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. if you are planning a video format from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning the file on a TV, you must choose the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds displayed a picture. the velocity of the image process is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. in doubt, you can set the name and path of the generated file under name of the mpeg file. keep the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, so this will be integrated into the movie. once you have adapted all settings of your computer, you can cook with the button below. depending on the speed of your computer, you can go quickly or in all silence to drink a coffee, and enjoy the thieves when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that Kodiers or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages above the right settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistance is allowed to print several images on a sheet of paper, along with standard photognies. this can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert images stored in one of three formats, JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original look of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that should be converted and restart the module. the Raw sculpkonverter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button, you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the white-off. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue editing the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow double details. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are happy with preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the conversion results will be adjusted and only the extension is adjusted correspondingly. JPEG is used to use a low-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression power.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are often used to edit your images or later you should not use the JPEG format as it allows only a limited number of operations before setting up the image quality. TIFF and PPM are well adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">In case you choose JPEG as memory format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start converting the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker mode allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode therefore if you are sure, for example through testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have the ability to automatically rewrite the file automatically. this is helpful if they have been created in an earlier attempt. however, this progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the image size reduction or enlarge. in addition, four types of image change will be provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option to adapt your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size changes in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed in this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparations: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the pressure resolution and size of the photo set. the target picture, including background size, edge and background colour, is adjusted correspondingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of additional images in advance. more pictures can move to the list of exposing images and place there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the pictures -window with the displayed displayed by you are displayed. add more pictures to the selected image. for the last selected image, a preview on the right side is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to the list of navigating images.</seg>
<seg id="875">Button images will be removed from the selected pictures from the list of the sent images.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selected all pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail clients with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected by you are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations regarding the size of sending e-mails. it is perhaps a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and every time you use until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you need to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you have to install the GmailAgent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the comments of comments in an attached file, comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG file under the menu images file format is not very suitable to use the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image format, select the original files in JPEG format, then the original extrudates will be added to the content displayed.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically to search for errors, see. your e-mail program will be started automatically by the end. with the knob, you can switch this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have presented your diaschau. you can choose here between the selected and all the pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">OpenGL-transitions in the presentation will use very elegant image monitoring via OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the distortion will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the file name of images in the left corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can manually start at Esc manually.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the pictures are shown in random order. so it will not be used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Delaying the pictures, the timely distance between the pictures can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance is on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so, you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between those you can choose. randomly choose any other effect between the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a tool bar at the upper left screen. move the mouse to this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can start and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left-hand side of the screen, you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI Module time & date is still no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-Imaging @ kde.or.or.Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to put an image as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the current selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbums; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, you are now in each group, so in people, places and in group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories where you have entered information as you have typed your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current looking pictures. in the following is described each for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse pointing to the entry, the view of the browser is changing. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed, both of which are to be seen. through this selection method, you can limit the number of images of a few thousand images to a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you select all the characters, places and other settings, you can view images with thumbnails to view images of your occurrence.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before their name. you can save with & kphotoalbums; however, for every person a private look image, this is of course also true for locations, keywords and other categories that you own themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images in addition to the names, select the button which is located to the right position on the toolbar. in the default context menu, you can select that you can view the view for each category. this has the advantage that you can view symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keyword (if you don't have suitable images).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to set up the image for each single person. to do this, you need to open the image image window (in a closer look), and select the image for the appropriate person. in the memory window, you can select the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the picture shows and be cut or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are looking for entry in the main window, you will see a dialog displayed on the image for fixed image properties. this dialog can still be seen on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the box labeling or description, the labelling or descriptions of images are searched for. if you wish, you can also enter a date, so for example, 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images in certain names, as you can see in the picture. here is shown to pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user guide for & photoalbums;. if you do not like reading handbooks, but rather like to try functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbums; and check out the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Launch & kphotoalbums; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & photo album; first time, or select the menu entry on photoalbums; -demo. then, some examples will be loaded and you can try the functionality of & kphotoalbums; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">In case you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbums; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main square of & kphotoalbums; see the timeline. a picture of these bodies look here:. as the name suggests, this Light shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. every single lste then shows another unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the box only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can interactively use the following ways: you can change the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first picture will be displayed in preview-preview) and, in addition, the timeline is always displayed the current date displayed at the moment when you navigate in preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a field of time bar by pressing the mouse button, and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time data is displayed. if you select a range, you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbums; provided you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. integrated and the other as a module available (see). in the following part of the user guide, the text is described in & kphotoalbums; integrated version you can create via the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created, you need to make some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is explicitly described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the surviving and a description that is to contain the HTML file later. on a photobox; HTML-example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & photo album will be created; export file is to be seen on the oversight page. nourishing information on the export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is shown on the HTML pages. so you can avoid that information is displayed by a party. for example, all pictures of a party are obvious. for example, all pictures are exported from a party. at the moment all images are exported. you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain viewer.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the setup possibilities are unique, which is why this is not special received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for images. thus, those who have a look at your site and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no more images download, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can be set up your pictures with a low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission rate. if he wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this installation area, you specify the different folder and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base file for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added to the location. this folder allows you to select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check that these really are all for viewing. if you choose a URL, a web browser, after the pages have been created, should be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files are not yet available in the final destination file, you have to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, right, you must specify the final goal of files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The only described options described are all three on base-folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is applied, whose name will define you in output file.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photo album; you can obviously create a HTML page for viewing the images. if you have already booked a lot of time for viewing the images, admission location, etc., then you need to do with & photoalbums; this work will not even be done.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & photo album; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. these images are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in it whether the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of all images can be put together and this file can be so independent. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file seeks the images in twofold ways. first, the images are not found, so the images of the URL, which you have indicated in creating the HTML files, is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file via HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for Export Import images, which you can export via the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three options available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manually option to copy the .kim file, you have to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option, copy & copy the .kim file directly to the .kim file; images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not able to compressed the files. if you want this anyway, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limited to maximum image size. if you are sending to your friends pictures, the .kim file otherwise would be very large. here you can limit the size, by example, that each image is supposed to be 800 pixel wide and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you use a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu import... select, & kphotoalbums; the exported database, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to imports is made of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folders will be copied to import images.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you will personalise the category persons of the import file (if you are a Dane), while this category is in your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog, which is to import the categories of imported file and which categories contain these in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can use the categories of imported file to the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: if you see images, you want to see images within different sequence groups & mdash; if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you may want to see all the pictures where this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will find the different steps of (1) fixed information about your images, via (2) look through and look through to (3) advanced topics and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was begun as a program for managing your images. it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently, this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbums; records all of the information stored in the index.xml in the top file of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, e.g. Normale backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions of the CVS, wherever they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbums; remembers the folder made in which your images are stored and use them automatically. if you want to read a different folder with images, you can start & kphotoalbums; with the option -c. as an example: kphoto album -c ~ / company / photos / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry Settings; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphoto album; in the following section of the user guide you will see the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, which allows you to call setup possibilities and options for the viewer. for each adjustment there is a detailed help available, which you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In it was described to you how to set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">In view of the dialog, which is used to process existing groups already. for each existing group you can choose a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the dialog, you can set complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in one group instead of all groups of a Mediglieds as explained.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setup possibilities, you can choose to set the list of members to set up. in the top box list, you can select the category you would like to configure. in the left window of window, a list of the current category and in the right is a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoAlbum; shares his modulation system with other graphics applications such as digiKam and gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; image Plugin interface. nourishing information on this site can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual, as they are not part of & photo album; however, most modules have a help-page that you can call on the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications are used together, it can be that modules with & photoalbums; only very little tested on your own pictures, before you call them on your own pictures using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. don't say that I would not have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & photo album; not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The largest difference between & photo album; and other applications that include KIPI, is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbums; this kind of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photo album; can be used.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & photo album simulates & photo album; the current album, which is simply the current view, shows all images that show you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & photo album has to record a list of albums. here's a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & colphotoalbums; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used as the category you have set in the dialog box as a Category for Virtual records. for example, if you use the category characters, you will have & photo album; so do so if you would have chosen people to view and continue the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photo album; not compatible, you can remove these modules from the modules. start the installation dialog and choose the modules that modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you can start your photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see the top of a menu and one tool bar. currently, it contains no more information about your pictures, as you can't have any information about your pictures. in the section you will display on this window, but just click on the entry pictures that shows you an overview of all the available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbums; is the ability to see each image with notes, where the picture has been taken on the picture, where the picture has been taken separately or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously. if, for example, to all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see this notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by typing people, locations and keywords. they are a very important part of & photoalbums; as you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shift of pictures within the list below: if you have a family party for example, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are shown, you can, by doing so the names used to be moved up and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive a alphabetically sorted list, click the symbol for sorting on the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you select notes on each image, you may wish to edit all selected images and have this pictures with notes. click on the front and back buttons that are located below the preview of the picture above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then you can be more comfortable to mark all these images and select the menu option of multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture, you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. in order to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the package, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new type or subcategory. additionally, you can also move an entry to a category of existing or subcategory to make this entry into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically. see also.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the dialog by adding the bodies which the upper edges of the frame form, click and move. you can also make your own windows by setting it out of the window range.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to store the current setup and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also send a frame completely. if you wish to receive this window later, use the button options... and here window a / out. see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have any filters. here, you can see the size of the thumbnails, by simply after getting the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you fuse a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture viewer. if you have no window opened with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to delete and press either the removing button or select the menu Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbums; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures stored on your hard disk. of course, you have to store the pictures anywhere, so you can store the pictures anywhere in the database. in the picture you can view the view from & photo album; if not all needed pictures from the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so & photo album; you can't see these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you need to see, you need to copy files from folders and copying files. & photo album; if you want to avoid the insertion of the question in question. if so, you can't want to avoid any damage to your pictures, please purchase a larger hard drive to save all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, select the pictures so that you can see for other unaccessible. alternatively, you can also see all images that can see your little sister, control and select everything except for current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have specified what pictures will be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry. if you want to get locked out, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered into unlock images. to set this password, simply select password change in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please consider that this picture protection is not very safe. for one, all the pictures can be found on the hard disk and to the other one can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves that those who are with & photo album; not very familiar to repel the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to manage all your pictures with & photo album; of course you can spend them at some time. of this reason, you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & photo album has a photo _ and video viewer. these can be seen from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. it is of course the picture, but additional all the information you enter via the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox is on the top part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily drag them by mouse and if any information is indicated. all these options are displayed following a right click on the viewer. all these options are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on this web browser, see right entries to this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">In case you have several pictures in the viewer you can switch between them and back up by using the buttons image high and end up. you can jump on the first and final picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also achievable from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are uploaded in the viewer, you can run them as a diaschau. as frequently there is a new picture load after a few seconds. as frequently there is a new image, you can press the trl button and plus or minus. then the distortion is stopped by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful capability of viewing & photo album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the picture, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom back out The Plus button in the middle of the picture. shows how a Zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the threadiness puts the zooms, so that each pixel is equal to the image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos that come in and out zooming with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the set functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes about the actual picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you see images, you can see a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image. at the moment you can view the view and enter configuration dialog for the image to view this name. however, you will perhaps take the image only to mark and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and view them as good or bad, while you look one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer indicates the possibility of paint images with features, while you see them. features are the letters A to Z and you can select a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in view, see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features to your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so if you have all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use one module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the foreseen view. if you add the categories in DRE preview, then you can press features to the pictures by pressing the letters for the characteristic after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. this case allows you & photo album; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The original is not stored in the image, but in the database. on the way you can reverse your foreold later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In you can view a picture on the painted picture. in order to complete the painting of & kphotoalbums; select the picture from the context menu. to finish the painting you just press the cross in the toolbar top at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to work with & caps, you have to have the application of the program & Povray; not fully dominate but the documentation on & Povray; you should necessarily read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then, their properties are shown in the object properties and the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subject of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>

<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marked the center for scaling and rotting as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Every object has a wire level as an wire level. you can only specify that value relatively to the level of the higher property or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level, smaller or equal to the tool chosen of the scene.</seg>

<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the symbol rendering the symbol rendering in the tool bar or select the menu entry view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render mode corresponds the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to rendering a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can combine any number of render modes, from a fast preview of up to full images in highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon or select the toolbar in the toolbar or select the Render modes menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size, you can apply the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering a small area of the picture, select the section section and specify the image section to rendering the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality, you can select the properties, the & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections lighting. an exhaustive description of the Render features can be found in the User manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different mistakes can be created. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are in the representation smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures featuring this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculates and binds to Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is adaptive, and adaptive because each Pixels depend on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam down pixel. if the difference between the color values will exceed the pre-given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by the persecution of a specific additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) will be added additional Rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 Rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixel, which will be further pursued and further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the low value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of space for beam process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to prevent regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long way to calculate an scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent if the associated beams have no object taken.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object bycatch of points on the button "button on the wire model" button. you can adjust the grid separate for shifts, scaling, and speeds.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values add a more accurate wire model, thus creating a better look for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects, such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed press for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed information for extended projections, all the wire model views are further removed if the camera uses an extended projection. the projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a box with two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, a floor below the objects is rendered. the ground will be displayed in a box with two adjustable colors.</seg>

<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window order: shows all existing window frames. & kpovmodelers; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of precursor window directives shows all existing window frames. a new arrangement can add you to the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below illustrates all views on the chosen window order. new views can add you with the button adding and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, you will create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unlocks, you get the window under the existing window, with card card, you can't list a map view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovsker; installed and now you want to start with more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate way to create simple scene under beginners: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully notice the following warnings, before you get complaining that you will only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, please note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, you can't use any rules for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything faultless, see the first start of & kpovsker; the following default window order form:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an adequate performance of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often need to use these menus and icons now, so you should remember the menus and symbols, as well as their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodelers; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and select the menu entry. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below), this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the object characteristics, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation, & Povray; please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but notice that the camera is in view of control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on the left button and drag him to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button or press the button, the wire model views and object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could set a cube (insert endable body quader) and size at x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumulative method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeling; indeed, offers a simple way. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name, and then press the button, or the command aste. in the object tree, the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the plane, though at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will notice that you can click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move to the floor into exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, choose the soil to set his material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something catches in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box that you can select as the object should be inserted. you can change the name in the object tree. you can change the name in the inherent view (name = Ground Pigment), with a click on the button. see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course the pigments depicts only a mat black material because you can still use settings for the pigment. therefore, remember to check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see in preview no color on the cube and the ball, click on the button and then click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you run your picture with a click on the symbol, you should obtain the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not able to enter the colors. here you need to set two new attributes. in the object tree you need to do the entry color list. then, select this entry twice (you can also do this even more frequently, but the chord colour list may only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree every time, select the colors in the object of the object characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step, you should already be able to run, as you model the basic work mode of & kpovsker; you should already have understood that the ball is just as easy as to create the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the object characteristics of the object characteristics you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: at 1 (do not forget the input, or push the button to press) so that the ball would float above the ground, as you postponed the ground about a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering yields a strange result: as already before, the ball-surface like a mat black material appears. place in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you choose the ball, you can now assign a material now. as in the bottom, enter the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose First sub-object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the pigment, then select Incolor and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach most interesting effects if you take the time, some finish features include:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on users or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already yielded good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which possibilities you & kpovsker; offer. hopefully you have learned much, you can easily create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Rayraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer hypothetical radiance from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects may appear in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the nebula. thus, the scene is set to pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, without a camera you can see nothing, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you can see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously every scene needs to be enacted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">The usual file dialog can select your file. POVRAY files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that modeled you with & kpovsker; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have stored the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restoring the scene in the last stored version. all changes since the last storage will be rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry, if you are not yet stored in the scene yet.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reset. this menu entry allows you to only select if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Records the current window order and opens a dialog, in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovelopes., here you can change the look, the keys and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialogue to change the keyboard shortcut. you can model default correctly with this option for & kpovsker; -instructions change or add new.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbars. you can model and remove tool symbols for & kpovkin models; add commands and remove them.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is an option to produce rough surfaces, without any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file either for a bump-map as well as for a texture-map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic sets are simple geometrical forms which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these fundamental bodies. these models will then continue to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture-map is an option to give the surface of an object colour on pixel base, using an image file as a colour card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and web browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a specific window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very easy. the file browser lists files, which you can display with click on & LMBn; or the key Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image should be displayed in a specific window, or whether all images are always using the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you're looking for a specific file, simply tap the first signs of the filename in the browser window. then appears a small input field in the right corner. if a password file is found, the file will be highlighted by pressing the return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In dialogue setting - & ball show; there are five card cards. in three of them, general and editing and slideshow, you can adjust the mode of & ball show; in the two other, short-commands for the display window and short order for the browser, the key formula can be set for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to display the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour that you can continue below. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loading & ball show; already the next image in the folder, while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is particularly suitable for slideshow.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script may not be implemented due to a lack of dependance. please check in your script, whether all the modules are available and use the dialog, so the user interface, why a script does not run.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / Templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or use it simply to expand the necessary functions. you will quickly find out that the script of scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP can exchange your scripts data with Amarok and Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; that each KDE installation should be attached.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allows to execute external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be easily accessed. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amble; messages notifications to all current scripts. for this reason, scripts to monitor the default entry of script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react appropriately to events. of course, a script should ignore the events if there is no use of it.</seg>

<seg id="1194">Custommenuclicked: submenu itemTitle: contains a user-defined menu entry. submenu and itemTitle are also given, so that the script can identify its own entry. to remove the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove a post again, one can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok branches off; or if the user stops a script, sends & amble; the signal SIGTERM will be done to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar), which can be optionally available with bzip2 (.bz2), which can also be seen clearly as Amarilo.kins.tar.bz2 with the user.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the kdelibs package and otherwise don't need any other KDE packages. you have to have installed kdelibs (including the programs contained, because & amble; you need some of them to be compiled modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to deal kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD set in advance that your window managers allow the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. for example, we try to support amaroK on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files can make a mistake in the TagLib library for days. you can review the file by using in ~ / .kde / share / apps / hill.kde.org and hang out the broken file that has caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and recreate the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of them is that Taglib read the meta info from this file. please tell these errors to the conference Lib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & ampling; is a bit more mature.</seg>

<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small groste is displayed at the bottom edge of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not appropriate, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switches the folder view or off. folder view also contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is activated, the content will also appear in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, lock and unlock the drive or discard of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switches with the content view or off. the content view allows you to select and set pulling files into the project view. the content view is also an interface for displaying audio or video CDs, if a drive was selected using a corresponding CD / DVD in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Toggle the headbar in the projection view or off. the headbar is a narrow area that's only visible when the projection screens has no real function, it looks only pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens up a dialogue window to modify the key arrangements for & k3b; after one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key order further below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts k3b; alignment assistance systems. thus, correct permissions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator rights are required, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator when you start the wizard (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general settings can be done. nearly all functions of & k3b; you should work on anhieb. this dialog is designed to personalise and encourage the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; also, like many other & KDE; -applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line program dcop, or something more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the scope of functions, therefore rather your taste and the type of task is crucial to give you the attached tools.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. in order to use the & DCOP; functions must make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & KDE; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface by & k3b; features features such as copyCD, formatDVD and additional functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () Void Ref createDataDVDProject () Void Ref createDataDVDProject () Void Ref createDvd () Void burnCdrv () Void burnCdrv () Void burnCdImage (KURL url) Void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result such a createXXXProject method, one can create a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternative to create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b features the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring) Void Padurl (KURL) (Qstring path) Void rename Item (Qstring path) Void rename Item (Qstring path, Qstring newname) Void setteeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">So it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3b interface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT scateFolder foo dcop $PROJECT scateaccording / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; can be read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder of the machine installed.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for example read & CD; -data in WAV files on the hard disk) and of many Kodierers, which are encoded using these WAV files (lossfree compression). other Kodiers can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossfree and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compresses to the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD, it is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other codings are already available, so it is highly likely to be installed for any Linux distribution. however, only the Kodierer packages are installed, which are needed. if the FLAC is not used, its installation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which codierpillar / file format should be used? the chapter Welter Codiers gives a small introduction about Kodiers, audio quality and compressing factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying of protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, used & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia for retrieving the protection, it is not possible to avoid any copy protection. in any case & kaudioCreator, it is not possible to avoid the copy of copying protection. simply avoid the purchase of copying protected audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting it only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration may be found until a suitable configuration may be found. this leads (hopefully) to comprehension for the slender approach to the user interface, which will often be stumbled on the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert many formats - depending on which the programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; you can get information from freeDB from the Internet or can operate completely without the network, everything is manually collected.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a brief list of commands of the main source. on the page step, you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program maps for the program configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB starts on request of the CD-data according to the CDDB tab. (this can be locally or online, in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the Settings tab for setup software - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the option can be read with another encoder than the standard. it is to be aware that the encoder is configured in setup settings in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, allowing a file to encode a file instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (as protocols, piepsen) for programme events (like reading & CD; terminate).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main set-up dialog by & kaudioCreator; with various credit cards (such as encoder, for setting the Encoders). hither you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'Monkey', which may possibly be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are low compression rates and hardly any commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, which lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at low bit rate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both the codiers generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be included with most distributions of distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bit rate) but compared with OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bitrate.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is supposed to be heard from one computer or a host-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also owned on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - early 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and the compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= These setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most musical ideas acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of teenagers, portable devices and auto-stereographic systems. but not good enough for better stereo audio systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset stane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolute highest quality without view of the file size, then choose this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="1526">Die & CD; information, which are manually entered or replaced by the program automatically from the freeDB file, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be delivered / used with & kaudioCreator; and the code program for creating the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with codierprograms, there are often a combination of program settings for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers explain the switch to these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; Title of the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; added. the result looks as follows: '-d {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button number in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can download the information up / enter the information, so that all other information can be downloaded from yourself in the machine: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal but I (note of the user: this is the author of the author). however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is also the information without the music business damage. all information can be obtained via a bumblebee by a & CD; business, physical or virtual, can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is active an address box (sending an address). for use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this sort of configuration, it appears that the email address is not used when retrieving data from server (This can only know the programmer that has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; used to use freeDB, the geographical workload should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and resembles the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of Spiegelservers for the online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually posted monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which elite program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... It was always the best choice for the evaluation of audio CDs; see also that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed first, if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the exclusive WAV files, the Kodierer and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tabby. other Koenerer can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package needs to be installed by the relevant Linux distribution, before the Kodiers can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined Kodiers. more information about Kodiers are located in the chapter Welter Koenerer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierer, further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of an command as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. verify the setup of the device number of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reader of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;) are installed. try to call both programs with a command line in one terminal. that might indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell & CD. this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this may be tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the whole manual, understood everything, but are somehow still uncertain as to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, do everything setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be installed cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. anyway, a suitable package for lame can be found as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, of course you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission to copy it (eg; by trying to copy something into the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & kaudioCreator;, something probably will be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD, which must be repeated for each exclusive & CD; it must be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the using codiers for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freeDB file to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it with any & CD, if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number is handed over to the evaluation program to read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device number of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a view into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. there is no much to do here. here an additional conversion is defined. in our example, everything will be ignored / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select with incomplete information, so that you will be informed when data are displayed in keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD file automatically download on the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during the activation of the & CD, so that it can be connected to the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD file is found. it is associated with low risk, if you are later unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename and file names can be easily changed with the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, if you want to manually use everything manually, you can download the select boxes and freeDB file. however, this is worth $620 MB in offline mode, you will need to be selected if this is worthwhile. in order to use freeDB in the offline mode, the two selection has to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freezed for us. these are settings for the data enquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server on the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. place everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we do not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the site freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both have to work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls manipulate the protocol 8880 standardly, there is perhaps more fortunate with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit an & CD; data on the freeDB server. the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the file / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time in just an existing drive? of parallel reading and encode? the author knows not to try them.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross it to the & CD; to discard the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined files for temporary files: if you're heading up this, then / must the path / folder will be displayed if only space is connected to another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will not be uploaded when you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything will enter as it is on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances it needs to be blinded to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags, in the case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the command file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we just have the basic set of & kaudioCreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each evaluation of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section is described as the process of selecting the & CD; on the hard drive, we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is installed, as we are convenient and the & CD; data from the freeDB can be fetched. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each exclusive & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freeDB, the screen photos will see a little different from than the data for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD, instead of sending them out of the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not attempt to find out the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD has to be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, like in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, you will seek questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been collected successfully from the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives a window embedded, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best suited to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the checkbox for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can manually loose this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have any local database, but take the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor -entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of input field 'Update Title', the rest of the data in an input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in an input field 'updating title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments as a single piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from the freeDB file the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to test the content of the CD editor, so you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired notes.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album, and titles of a piece and only 28 signs for the comment field. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least for which & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed, take a look at the tab 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with him you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be supported by all codiers or file formats. see the help to the Koenerer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obvious to the style of the exclusive CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD yet. for more information please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the specified data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece. be the title of the piece on any case and other information they wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you downloaded from the freeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece a or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or select the button All pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection process reading process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch on the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message you will see if you are attempting to work with a Kodierer you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have writing access to the files for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the balance.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, check out and encode in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and encode. in high-performance machines, the calculator with an amd64 appears to have no problem when simultaneously reading and encode (of course, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is coded for a third order in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message appears at the top left of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator; you need & KDE; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to produce compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the codiers of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudioCreator; however, it is provided within the KDE; CVS is part of the kicking multimedia package. however, you can find an anonymous copy here. most distributions are already a pre-compiled package, da & kaudioCreator; part of an important & KDE; package is a part of an important & KDE; if you read this, you probably have done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people compiled by source files, and not intended for users to use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be adjusted to suit your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs, has many variations on settings. at best, read the step by step example to know the options and settings. it displays screen photos of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, ever-read yet? even if only the help menu was clicked off the program Start as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">Who reads it? who reads this, has probably started the program. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author can do not count this manual. it is thought as the first version for a manual to & kaudioCreator; may it be. at least, after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has adopted this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when it has managed to get the source file from & KDE; SVN, you don't need this information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others, he has not yet have some properties that do not have real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & KDE; support also the & Linux; Ultrasound projection drivers, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is involved as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the song text on the screen with changing colour, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressing keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can pull in & KDE; any MIDI file from a & constellation; window on KMid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or textures). KMid controls automatically the method used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you stop & KDE; during the recording of a song, KMid starts again with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, which allows you to select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also have a file from a & squeror; window in the & kmid; window fall. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and run the button duck in the toolbar, select the entry playthrough from the menu pieces or create the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece will start automatically once you move it to the & kmid; window. (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then recorded afterward.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find a song too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows at the left and right of the speed display and so the billing speed can change. in order to regain the original pace, click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, does a print on the button pause, or select the menu entry in the menu, so it breaks the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text-event, others use lyrics and another. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically identified, allowing you to set anything manually. if you select anything manually, you will automatically have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, choose from the menu settings the entries text events or song events. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files, which you summarize. these are played in the series after. in this section, how you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collector manager. in the menu Collection, click here. click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then define the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs like the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the right to the collector manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. don't worry if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to add a song to the project manager. once you can add a song, you can again select the File dialog, with the help you select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic settings to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece is automatically added to the active collection (using File opening or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection, the collection is activated, activated, and it will be activated, then the collection will continue to be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collector manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removing.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the sequence in which the songs can be played. if you select the series from the menu selection sequence of the menus, the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it to the manager manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the knob button, the entry of previous pieces from the menu, or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collector manager, choose to delete the collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be erased. however, that doesn't matter, since it is not stored at leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translated into events that understands synthesizers.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all the events of the Type Change patch to Bright Piano in the events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always gives a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all the sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all the necessary adjustments for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may seem as often as desired. for this purpose, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the keyboard"... End Define KEYMAP "A new Keymap..." End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and end that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can support in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI can be depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order nor line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All KeysTo M is needed to lay all the sounds on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun type. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (enforcing), patch 100 (the drum at your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which is the sound in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, in which each sound represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means the sound level of the always equal drum (such as some keyboards own).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify such sounds on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As in the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several Keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to make sounds on the Perkscreen channel. look at the supplied keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to exchange some channels to others. if you want to change some channels for the first and the second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is part of the channel that is depicted on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyboard must be specified in the file name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option may be useful for example to always use the Perkscreen patch on the Perkscreen channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for pitch assignment indicates in which relationship pitch Bender events will be multiplied. if so, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event, then it will be redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then will be forwarded to the formula n * (r / 4096), so that the Map file doesn't include a decimal (Map file).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards to play two sounds up to an octave above. in order to try the right value on your keyboard, you need a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI settings. in the menu, you will find the MIDI settings stored in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole number of piano (one for any MIDI channel). on these claws you can see which sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have modified a tool, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view in menu settings under the Point canal view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed, played with a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so that can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force not force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binaries (rpm, deb) from & kmid. this happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from Kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">If you necessarily need to add automatic settings to the collection, otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can get the arrow button on the left from Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & KDE; -Desktop with my MIDI-folders and & kmid; on this way, I want to play a MIDI file or if I want to play a MIDI file or I would like to play a file, merely go to the & Konqueror; change window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you would like to listen to a file only once you want to add in to a collection, switch the automatic settings to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. you only want to play the first file only. so, set the automatic settings to collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly these a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then join in B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you so much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, animated me to program & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, I try not to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, making music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or proportionally @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really don't want to send me a huge anticipation, if you send me a postcard from your home or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. if you would like to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you would like to send me a MIDI file, but you should contact me when I already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and don't emanate money for that. I would therefore emphasize that I will only start reprogram, because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us these wonderful midi- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have any sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it runs as if you would have a sound card except that you can't listen to music of course.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The window window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections below the Bookmark, but these are single entries. if you would like to create a list of entries that use after each other, you should use the Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchies. if you pancé one entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category, and playback will start with the modified entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and continuous playlist may also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this by editing, but also through the application itself. in addition, the various files in directory, choose from the menu view and next edit mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML contents will appear on this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select playlist must be selected from the menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the author's convenience of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starred and Finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable other animation. & kmplayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / / mplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The starting animation does not need to be short, it is automatically finished by opening another source. this would be troublesome at the end-animation, but the user can therefore quit the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodyworks; & lt; & lt; / / / / / / / / etc; & lt; / / / / / /; in the source package of & kmplayer; are listed in the tests / some examples of SMIL die from & kmplayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuring mplayer in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. here, the path of the MPlayer and the intermediate storage size can be set out of the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer;. everything must be configured to manually edit the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayfully, such as the setting of the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field of embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order to play the & kmplayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & kmplayer device must be specified as service provider for the Mime Type application / x-Shockwave-flash in the configuration dialog (KDE).</seg>
<seg id="1725">The queror or & kmplayer; can be used in a consoles application and search for error messages on the store of the browser library. if no error occurs, the backend edition within & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So always a given backend for a particular Mime type is removed (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV channels can be viewed, the scanner should be configured to use device and the TV channels can be edited manually or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorders) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be ports to be selected (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR can only use XVideo, XVideo is also supported (probably this kind of recording video devices under Linux) is supported. for this reason the video forlinux extension has to be functioning properly. for the XFree86 server it must be functioning in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1758">New users have now not worry about. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just as other source code editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile, it is a simple problem to find that any mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is characterized by the modest appearance of output file. however, it is possible to save you by highlighting time and more.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic placement of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ ', {command}) by & kile; automatically a blank line to the end of the command (e.g.\\' {command}). this function can be deactivated in the menu settings; set up... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. latex; encourage the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most open and subtler element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In view of the document in the structure view, the single elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective transition and to be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating its own & latex; files can be very helpful. once a DVI; file [open-uninterrupted file (engl. D e V ice I nd. File)] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and other information such as the font, and is also available in addition to PDF the output type & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for view, conversion and printing from DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the file-search, the elements of DVI; -File has been clicked on a element in the & latex; source code is the exact opposite of it. as soon as soon as part of a section in & latex; source text is clicked, the appropriate section in DVI; -viewer is speckled.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used to work with multiple files. with a master document, the work is simplified with other integrated .tex files. when using a project, a project project can be adjusted to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quickset: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File recovery: in this mode the DVI; file on the screen-ready-hold-hold-hold and there is no access to & eyepiece; after the quick-growing.</seg>
<seg id="1769">For viewing of the processor toolbar, the three large selection fields should be developed. the selection box is designed for rapid inclusion of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... the purgable & latex; -instructions for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field more is available for items such as keywords, fox, notes, notes and references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: using this command, a description is created for a section, a picture or different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a fixed term (choose a selection box is possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries will be displayed. in & BibTex; files are necessary to edit the file. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and can be krongly into & kile; written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for the font of the font. it can be set the font for the main text, the notes, notes etc., the following font components are set for:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two selection options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and nurturing of the settings. 2. the document can be written by the bottom of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the font is fixed. if the font is not fixed at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do is to use the menu Bauen or the button quick.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compile. & kile; add the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document expires, the document should be searched after the errors. when using quick installation & eyepiece; this is not the case, the protocol should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English environment) is a text that is different from the remaining document. for example, a report with the font contains 12 and only a few south pin should be a different correspondence with the font,\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} encouraged the open to the font within the area.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be supervised in the environment (from\\ 'n {group} up to\\' (environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the possibility of submissions within one environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for increasing the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, coursiveness, submissions, etc. these commands are either end with the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ 'n {emph}: this command is available as long as long until it is closed with a\\' {stamp} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ emph {word} recursively.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ A {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing the source text with the & latex source code, now a step-by-step instructions will follow, follows the creation of a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as in the assistant a bit text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be completed. for this, mind. a quote, a few positions in fat and cursive printing and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor-view or Ctrl e can be turned back to the editor (at an internal viewer). in an external viewer, the windows must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simple test and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; a single file format (engl. D e V ice I nd.). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF folder or computer monitor.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating a document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using file printing (the viewer properly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar feature the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into the toolbar is able to start in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">You will open the direct leap from the Editor to add-in position within DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. only modern must set up with the Kile settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">To order the pre-search process, the mouse is positioned in one line of the source text and clicked on pre-search for pre-search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; click on a click of the central mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; open and set to the corresponding line. for this you need & kile; in & eyepiece; as text editor (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick design of the & DVI; viewer can't open it, you can submit an error. if a bug is pre-indicated, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file is distorted the error source in the source code. in the editor, the entries can be used in the error. the protocols may be clicked on the error in the logging, must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once click on the toolbar in the toolbar, a window appears to choose a selection of documents for the document. the preset includes:</seg>
<seg id="1799">For a selection of empty document, a document can be used either of a new document or the assistant to the rapid preparation of a new document. further information on this section are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Basic users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded, to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you must either create an existing & tex; - / latex; file open or create a new file. & kile; can create a new template by using a existing document and selecting file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings can be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables may be set in Settings... Settings... Settings set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating the own template, it is therefore necessary to know which character strings can be replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it will be used as the following:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and that with the command in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then the own template instead of the standard single document can be mined.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from all & latex; files created in a simple way to create a template, should be searched after one on the Internet and the steps below described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for tools directly from & kile; can be done out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and to learn his personal possibilities the manual should be drawn to Kate. users of & kile; you can start with reading the chapter with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called for the menu help LaTeX reference. you can find an Expensive description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with crossed Ctrl key to display the & tex; this means that in this way, click\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par to.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The text-lined text will automatically be copied automatically when pulling the text.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, select parts of the source text in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to browse various types of source textures and these emphasizes. for example, the & latex; for example, differ from normal text and also the mathematical formations are highlighted by another colour.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants have to reach the jumping brand. this is a unique type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu entry is highlighted the leap to the nmost or last sprint brand. thus, this sprint brand is emphasized that it will automatically become the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The processor is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & kile; although & Kate; already outstanding possibilities for writing a & latex; important functions for writing a & latex; important functions for the writing of a & latex; special commands for their selection. in processing, the following commands are included in the text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If a complete passage consists of (group of rows, which contain on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning is not a text with through the source text, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventive situation in & kile; is that the image is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word inlays down the word under the current cursor position. this option has also an extended meaning, as this command is also latex; -commands with a ratio (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To view a part of the document can be removed and removed by pressing the key. & Kate; offers the key solution for a faster connection. under editing are the following commands to contain the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete passage. the definition for a shipments in & kile; is included in the description of machining distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been noted that environments is a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile provides; for more commands under editing area for a sincerely simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is injected to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly before the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is injected towards the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the order to close the doors.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor before or within the command\\ 'begin {surroundings} is used to jump (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When typing of many extravagant environmental commands soon the public view can be lost quickly. this order closed the last modified environment, so that the spared environmental structure will not be distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for latex; groups that are determined by staples {...}. in edit TeX group, some important commands are to correspond to those made of processing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is used at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the welded clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor before or behind the clamp of a & tex; group # is, the other end of the group is injected (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When typing of many scraped groups brackets can be lost quickly to the desired group, this order closed the most recent group so that the spared structure of the & tex; groups cannot be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple operations are used as genes. for the purpose, the character is used in & kile; the sign "is used for two simple operation signs. for example, the sign will be used for two simple purposes.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double starting point can be set under the Kile settings... LaTeX and turn off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also different settings (e.g. nical or French) or used for German or French purposes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When switching off Shift; inputs and kile; a smart tastier breaks. if the current position is located within a lists -environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), it is not only a tick-break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close to a tables -close t & kile; the current line with\\\\ associated with a close-end line breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be stored under settings; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users may arrange the columns into tables and all the Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & kile; seeks to encourage and kile; according to the next tabulator in the top line. although this tabulator is not added, add & kile; some interspace for the columns of the current tabulators.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already has a good source code completion, this in & kile has been added; in order to have special commands (mostly for & latex;), these modes are set for automatic change. all these modes are possible for different work conditions under the Kile settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When beginning a new environment using the '\\' {Area} is & kile; automatically added to the '\\' section after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When running the RÃ ¼ inch button, the last letter of input will be removed and you are using the complete list on the other hand. on the other hand, the list can be diminished by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, you will be mixed with a selection of a command. alternatively, you can submit a jump to these positions via edit sprint brand of sprint brand, and the only parameters will be collected.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings; set up... kile; complete settings for these lists are made. there are many different ways of choice for & tex; - and latex; -commands as well as traces of the common language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not suitable for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ 'time to be entered and the call of the completion mode is used for a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, environments are often used that & kile; a special mode for completion of environments for processing.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the case of understanding, the menu Edit menu or the button "Alt + switchcraft space bar will be automatically covered by the environment and it appears\\ '. afterwards, the environment will be continued on a simple way and through the installation of the typing button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. as soon as & kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be mixed with.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings; set up... kile; complete settings for these lists are made. this mode uses the list of the complete set of objects for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; underline user-defined lists of removable strings, which are immediately set up by the kile character strings. as an example of a cashing list, the file example.cwl is included in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L has been entered and the word generated mode for the menu processor or the key type Ctrl + alt idle button is replaced, the letter L is replaced by the character\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Certainly not helpful, the automatic change will not be helpful. however, it has been found that many of them can be written in a document more than once. this means & kile; the completion of all is already written.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for additional changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF edition is made, the pages can be arranged with a few & PostScript language tools and then be converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To encounteract the result of the work, you have to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the menu of creating compile, creating change and creating view.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to be a unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have multiple roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose out of the list of teammates who he is. this happens by selecting the team member out of the list and the button Setze is expresses. the currently selected member (your identification) will be bold after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the Select DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is discharged by the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Generating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup packages that can be restored with a blackout or crash when next start of the program can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file. also not stored documents will be a backup regularly, according to the set time.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Check the Plugin: if this plug is activated, then tested & quantaplus; if the plug-in is not available at the moment if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; since version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. debuggers support for the non-built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger-plugin concept was implemented, allowing various implementations on plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a matching Debugger plug-ins in the project settings. along with the Debugger Plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appear in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that is shown in the output (as in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">In this promotion, the connection is required for debugger, if necessary, or she shares the plug-in with, on departs requirements. this action is activated by default when a project is opened, that must not be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter to debuck's session starts the meeting. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the lustling to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to enter a Debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is shown in the debugger issue.</seg>

<seg id="1985">Shows the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without informing information about control variables and the current line number. if this is done while a script is done, the execution will proceed as soon as a request is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, without going into functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible, if possible in functions and includes properties.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger to go over and go over to the next, as if the current does not exist.</seg>

<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the self-uresome, the & quantaplus; for the day shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick setup of tags in a document without a risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but file. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder bear the name of the writing language and version, so there. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the day XML and defied whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limits will be made in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only be found once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a single element type about itself nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the class type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. returns the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute, and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describe the attribute of a tags. this element can be found only once for each attribute. additionally, it contains the name and type of attribute. additionally, there is more tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Are the source code used for the attributes in the tag editing dialog and the attribute tree to the attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting machine and a methodology. the arguments that will be delivered to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that grouped together the elements of a list. it can be used for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue. this day can only occur in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; -day). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Returns the position and size of a field in the dialog. this day should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the defining tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element guy.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All day XML files must begin with an & XML; -Declaration begin: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be tilled and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not influence anything but respect & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; Tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will not be replaced, but some pieces of the work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the TagXML files, the tools can start in the & quantaplus; window to launch and check the TagXMLA window. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. at present, check only in the shop of the TagXML-files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; Schematic &gt; ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; Schematic. the file name for this TagXML file is supposed to be schematic tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; -file is as quite simple and there is an editor that can be arranged via DTD-edit DTD settings; for one out of a list of selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = uses 1 for & quantaplus; Version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">One action can set up actions with settings... created. click on New Promotion through the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action has been assigned button1 button. click the user button to be assigned a button. with Kone you can remove the current key formula.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The easiest actions. it can be entered into the detailed settings and in version of the promotion, this text is inserted at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to modify the document or as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">While qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use% scriptdir / myScript.sh. in this way tries to find & quantaplus; the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH It gives other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the document's URL. in the case of a local document, file: / out of the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used for the control of & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters of this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the described methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be made at the default setting. in the box input, the default input can be determined, which is to send to the default input. options include:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the document's selected area will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be implemented the output of the executed application. there are two types of issue: normal edition written on the default issue; error messages can be specified, which is to be done on the default copy, by default the set-down output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many Tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to set the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create any group of their own toolbar. in given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select settings instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes and you use their use, activate the dialog "Day" when available, so that a input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it a ugly symbol. who should remember the action with this symbol? are we replacing it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the promotion is better represents, we will use & kiconostals; select from the menu menu;, graphic further programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconography; uses standard 32x32 pixel, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to realize what the promotion does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green it is usually interpreted as los, starred, further interpreted), or should at least set a message to the user, startling; -day to add in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press him.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Push the button and continue along with other tags, so there are still which are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some normal & quantaplus; functions for tool bar supplement or it should set this for a better overview by some Trenker into several groups. open the tool bar to set up dialog on toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenker (on top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element, which is to be added to tool bar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separate grouping support. someone who doesn't know my tool bar could believe that the & Konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by cheating all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the correct folder. after neweXML does not exist, it is stored in the correct folder, but your tool bar should be stored in the right file. please adjust their tool bar (s) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal users the option to add documentation to the script language or the formatting language, which you like to like. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, check out in & quantaplus; Repository, if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file. first, we leave you to handle the second part here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in main index top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentary section 1 = _ 1.html-2 = tag 2.html-2 = tag2.html-2 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree. for example, you can see in the & PHP file; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Elements Top element = php, documentation Started = Introduction,... Introduction = Distion.html... Language Reference = basic syntax = language.basic-synchron.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the chute depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the contents are referenced directly to a file (and consequently the upper end of the BaumanView & mdash; folder will appear!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing but respect & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is to be displayed in context of context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two kinds of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of related context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file simply save up to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / share / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have specified this in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation is used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked at the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the hidden resources (DTEP packages, tool bar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an email option, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where any other & quantaplus; -users are reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and used for publication. to make use of a useful contribution, we recommend the resources of resources to be provided for our team as well as for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not stored) or in the event that you will need multiple keys, you can continue an input. in the dialog New Resource, you'll need to continue an input (URL preview can be empty) and click OK to upload the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, toolbar, most toolbar, and appear in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before installation, examines & quantaplus; the authenticity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correct, a message appears with the indication of the author's author.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-language, which is currently not produced by & quantaplus; however, it can be timed because hundreds of day files might be needed in the day. there is easier way to convert DTD to an DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and convert from DTD. select the .dtd file with DTD description that is to be used. afterwards the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">The goal name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string that appears in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd is to be released</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment from DTEP after conversion: if enabled, bring & quantaplus; according to converting the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly introduced & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand and make full benefits from & quantaplus; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little bit of use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projection. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; available, available in the joint folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators of different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most limited size. all elements are set aside in the folder's folder, what are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction manager, the cartons with info and the tool bar. please suggest in, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click into the right button to obtain a context menu with the right mouse button, such as close to the current, other or all unloading, new loading, erase or upload of document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click on the Editortion section to create a further context menu in terms of the document content, such as basic editing steps (copy / paste / paste in), editing the word under the mouse pointer or open the file, if the string is named under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor, the tool bar is located in the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and therefore linked to user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; then you can insert the symbol that is the day represents, then you can insert the data for this just one day. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction manager (QIT;) allow to navigate and cross it in the information & quantaplus; navigate to files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction manager.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows the administration of files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out with the then shown context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole web site & etc; There are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; industrial templates are always available, local templates only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the script language. the concept of setting in global, local and project also works here. by clicking on the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to restart, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. through the left-click of an element, the cursor will be placed on the position of the element. through the right-click of an element, a list of commands in terms of navigation and the refresher of the tree is opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other constructions. with it, manoeuvattributes and namespace can be changed. this allows to change the attributes of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. it can be downloaded, edited and viewed from the quantaplus; 'document website can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes in the bottom end of the window, can be reached via the usable information: the news window and the problem.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This flashpoint shows information on each in Quanta running script. such as the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This flashy displays all error in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bar is extensive and easy to understand. showing them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the tool bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tsar-Archive via & kmail; if you receive a tool bar in an email, they can assure them in & quantaplus; like any other assure and unload!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the & quantaplus; autoconf file a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantaplus; you should check whether your path is the & KDE; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH before her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a wide variety of functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & coding; the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious, extendable Markup languages? well, this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer in pure & HTML; restricted, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then it should be & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & KDE; designed, in good use of free software, the idea of why else has developed? thanks to the & KDE; -scaffold it is not only everything possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web development to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can be increased productivity almost every task. through the program Komm you can realize & quantaplus; extend without any scripting linguistic-tax loss. (find out more about them in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& quanta; currently developed and cared for by Eric Lafflower Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, where the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use. check in the section via templates. should you try to save the selected file / Text outside the local / project template. only a mistake is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts to insertion from the clipboard there is special characters for & HTML; -encoding, so it is correct and not properly displayed by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from clipboard in & URL; -aphrase, which the correct path to insert of special signs and spaces in & URL; it's primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor-tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or off. this allows you to pick text blocks with the help of the & shift; key to choose.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are issued!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in selected directory. a kind of grep or used with GUI and predefined expressions in order to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and enrollment of the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main driver. the problem reporter is activated once the structure changes.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Indicates the symbols turn left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When reading Bookmarks in the current file, they will appear together with entries to date or next, depending on the cursors position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy graphic files in your project file or subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Download the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; -projects are the details explaining details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project tool bar. these are kept in project you / toolbars and are only available in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">To add a dialog to add a new tool bar. this is created only the name. actions must be saved by default actions. toolbars are stored on toolbars as toolbars or you are asked at the end if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a tool bar from the screen. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload toolbars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Upload one & DTD; you or anyone else has done and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Unload / repetitive entities from the & DTD; it makes sense to renew the entities from the & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder will not be present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tools. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is available, there is a sub-menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows you to access the current day installation dialog, if there is one. this entry is always available in menu tags, followed by & DTD; specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated / activates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently it works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; insertion by toolbar, if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins listed below the above listed item is enabled. click into the plugging plugins activated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Elects the value mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identification. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by using the external application Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch-over may sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card mode that is also the default mode, or the default mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu for each open window, includes an entry. with selecting an agreement the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quantaplus; main windows.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog can use any application that use the KHTML-Part including the & constellation; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Address the behavior of the Editorrent editor. in the Documentation of & Kate; you find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add names and sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce an help according to the mouse-carrier environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always help use. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form will find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project, as for example, after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here's the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be completed automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can see the server address of the machine to access one, except for local data. either a name (hostname.Exam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log is used. depending on the remote computer settings, an adaptation may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder, in which the templates for the project is stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder, where the toolbars can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change the static web content you want to download and change. in serversing scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defendant, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated. if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of vouches.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in main folder. you can select the desired files through anhaken or by removing the hairpin, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu-frame Profile, or with the button closure Shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which are newly ignored during project-related operations such as project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option on top, including files listed in .cvsignals are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is reloaded during opening the project, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The Debugger Plugin is currently supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the option options. the debug is described in.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as viewing a tree-view for the contents of the server for each profile, indicating your own structure of your profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow of Team configuration, project members can be added, edited, or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window configuration, one can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete these actions, if a certain event occurs when a certain event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select Project... from the menu project or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the project opens and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you charge a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project view provides free access to the files in the project. the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">File behave as well, however, the entries are open and opening together with... in the right-to-point mouse menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Various profiles can be searched here. the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Enables the removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blown to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in core memory and must be forgotten for programming. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather un-secure password on the record store is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialogue when you change your opinion from the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-capacity profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. in the editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Port for transfer. usually this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not have service to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can not be read easily, but everyone with programming language can easily be seen in the plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be used in a project many views, i.e. by simple departs of the view, diverse files and toolbars can be loaded, and replace the latest opened files and tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the project, or project tool bar, accessible via settings of toolbar-toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has the most to do. this does not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own work mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best via the tool bar. use and add to appr. adding tool bar is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be configured either by context menu (right click on the toolbar) in which can be done with new action, toolbar, toolbar or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialog, which can be specified, which should be displayed on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a tool bar, additional entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up the toolbars in the menu with settings and set settings.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially factual, code sniff, and files to link. & quantaplus; uses basically as a standard file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any of the existing folder in the storage space. templates in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read that in the beginning of any template specified conditions before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is everything that's not pure text. it can be added any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates normally are inserted into documents using links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the store room under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. based on this templates, new documents can be created. usually, special scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in a proper way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the same room for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted into the documents, but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see some examples in the store room below global templates. see more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says we are serving these templates for all websites as templates. you are a collection of different documents, which can be organized in a folder tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to Believing (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the storage area under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template store as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection is simply drawn with pulling and shutdown to the Baumantle templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file will only copy in a template file. you can use all file management functions for it, such as pulling and dismantling or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click in the file tree or in the project files Baumanviews to a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, the project file is secured, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project presentation enable a very target-oriented approach. you can insert head lines and footer lines or link dynamic with & PHP; in addition, some things can keep on using templates in projects very deep in the eye.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the underwindow templates is based on the files based in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / Templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / Templates. each of these folders correspond to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder in the text overview, click on the folder and select menu properties, which appears in the context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blown away as soon as Elterelles attributes can be burned.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except for regular folders in the previous overview. if a regular folder would be configured unless they would appear explicit. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed prior or recreated text for templates in this folder. this could be general headline or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special headline / footer a full presentation already with the matching headline / footer.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a text menu (pointing to the right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source editor that is easily accessible via the menu view. the first mode will replace the source editor in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and reactivate at need for the source code editor where the changes implemented in the VPL; editor is visible in the source code.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to the same. why & kdiff3;? let me explain shortly, why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had been corrected as many changes, and at the same time, another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where maybe the deposit had changed. these changes had a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a row and changes to white signs. later any amount of additional useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare it quickly, copy it to the clipboard and add it to one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; nearly to a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two persons are independent of each other at a piece of coke and make changes. the original file (the base) helps and make changes that are expected at the same time. in this Editor, you can even edit the result even directly. in this Editor, you can even edit the result even directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps with the comparisons and mercements complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; with file merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the precise differences and user-based capabilities of current color monitors. if you often need to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are visible. if lines only differ in certain number of white signs, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no sleeves, if no one changes the onset.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other distinguishes in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can facilitate tipwork by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse 2-diff3 folder 1 folder 2-o target folder, diff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 2 folder 3-o Objective folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open Dialogue enables the manual typing of filenames, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file again; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparing or merging of folders will be inserted, but if for A a file is selected, then use & kdiff3; file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If Merging is checked, the input field is active for target and it is not necessary to determine immediately a output file. you can also do this step later on storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but rather than parts of a text. & cdiff3; allow you to select text parts from the clipboard in the active comparison window. the comparison starts out immediately. in opening dialogue, you do not need to select any files, you can simply connect the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and merge: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text editor and let it drop over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What sort of thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you would like to find out how similar these features are, they would need to load two corresponding files they are in & cdiff3; download and then compare it. now you can simply copy the relevant sections, add, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can pull out anything from & cdiff3; you can only get rid of text in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and dismantle of text in another program as cut out and insert text (instead of copying and insert). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box the info-line contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) each Info line has a different color. (if the path is too long, leave the mouse for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source codes are the letters A, B and C are assigned. a color blue, B, the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees the color that distinguishes itself. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">On the left next to the text, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, B. are white signs only relevant in strings and commentary, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases relevant.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line divides the summary column from the text, is interrupted at the occasions, where the respective source file has no lines. if the line demolition is activated, the line will be displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison models) also has a Info-line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [modify] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the Save is disabled!!! (use the buttons to the next-dissolved / unresolved conflict around the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons can be used, each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Through one click of the left mouse button in one of the windows selected, the first line of the group is marked in all windows, and the first line of the group is indicated. (this group will also not be visible in the windows.) This group becomes the current group. it is highlighted with the color background colour for current area and each left hand appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic interaction or by manual do no longer stays in the group; then there is only one placeholder for the event that you will change your mind and perhaps again a different source. this text is not published in the final open file, nor in a mark that you may copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge pages; however, it appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the results window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore the numbers, or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This will navigate mostly with the frame rate and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the window, you can use the arrow keys left, right, end, trl-beginning and trl-end, sif as you can also use it from other programs. the overlap column next to the vertical image bar can also be used by clicking here.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default setting is the input mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click of the left mouse button to synchronize the view of all windows in the beginning of the respective group (as described in the section called together and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl picture) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl picture) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl picture). therefore, all deleted conflicts must be distinguished as a conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insert). if this is enabled, what always you mark, automatically into the clipboard, and manually copy the manual copying. be careful with this option but you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilles are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. UNIX-variants use a line-in-run\, and Win32-based systems use car backward +\ r\. Kdiff3 retains the source of the source files. therefore, you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the last used files are automatically saved and recovered during the next start. (menu configuration &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a typeface with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog is also available with variable latitude to choose, you should not use this.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen scripture cannot support this account, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the button preferences automatically introduces an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tabulator window will insert the corresponding number of spaces, otherwise it will be inserted a tabulator icon.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entry or return, the one line will automatically be used for the next line as well.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied into the clipboard. manual copy into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which the line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When converting files tries to find kdiff3; first, all fully identical lines will be ignored in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. in this step white signs are not ignored. even when merging white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car backdrop '\' on the end of a row, other again save & kdiff3; the car backdrop, but then you could be visible with different sizes on the side-side comparison, but then how a white sign is treated, however, if this option must be disabled. in default, this option must be disabled. in default, this is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">The default setting is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored the differences, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The default setting is deactivated. changes in commentaries are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic-forward mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is indicated before going on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically removes all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if the automatic selection of many files are less important. if you don't use the features Wähle A / B / C for all ungelly white conflicts of the merge menu. note that the automatic selection may ignore conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge. see for details of documentation on the directory and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version is called Suffix .original. if already such a backup file with the Suffix .stock exists, this will be deleted without a further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must finish and restart, so the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is adjusted globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you use this option, all entries will be used for the top setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the selection fields for the coding, a short notice which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file coding for source files. this influenced how special characters can be treated and interpreted, since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, can be compared to files with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can choose which coding for storing is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define processes, you might have to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only define with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of output control panels.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off the pre-emphasis of changes in white characters in the text or review. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is available only if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are shown in a color coded overlap column. however, sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files. according to selection of A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; C is displayed next to the normal one another transfer column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd like to use the available room on the screen for long lines. simply check out the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window by side or against each other. this can also be useful for viewing rows of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together. a simple click will then perform the merge menu as well if you use only two files. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be delivered first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write this function for example, for example out of out of the parts or to correct the alignment.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. (see above), then the output of the command is used. the output of the command is only used at the line. you can write your own precept. every input line must have an appropriate issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind is to enable users more flexibility when set up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases used sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this process command to convert the input into case letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\. * is a ergent expression of the first text in a row. the\\ 1 creates the found text in the first clutch couple. the\\ U converts the found text in case letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically generated strings written (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). *\\ $/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command to be suitable for line off. it 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Jewel ['] is a hit, and each showing will be replaced by nothing, so basically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several symptoms at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the requirements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed sed, you can also use something different such as perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' However, perl needs some details in perl. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and maintain. further operations only change the data, which appears the line-down algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off processor is the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you can't notice certain differences and will see important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in one folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete file recursively and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for every object a proposal to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate it and shows the simulated changes, without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparisons and merging of individual files. you only need to open folder on the command line or in the dialog File.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three files are merged, folder 1 is used as base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders does not start the merge. to run the merge, you need to select the corresponding option line or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading folder, you will notify a small news window about the current progress. if you break scanning the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is done, & kdiff3 shows a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and any folder made during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure will normally be folded. you can open a folder by clicking on + / - or click on the item by clicking on the button and open all subdirectories with which you can open all the subdirectories with which you can open all folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and the details pane. in such a case, the merge action can't be automatically elected. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, columns A / B / C are available in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folder will be considered identical if all of the content is identical. then folder the same color. with folders, the age is irregular for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a sheet again, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same file type (e.g. A a folder and B one file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. A a folder and B one file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faults exist, the clerging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronize is active when only two folders and no exponite target folder were activated, and if the option is synchronize directories. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary support, so that both files are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible data name for the output file only B; copied directly after compiling & cdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folder will be merged and select the new file instead. if the files are different, but the date of files are different, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merge can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During meeting a file is done according to the other. it status column indicates that if the merge was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected is completed, you should make a final review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If set the file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts is only displayed if three files are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge either the selected entry (file or above), or select all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then it will be used in three-file association-merge mode, when the two-file association will lead B as target and syncing A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you select a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped in folder. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To put all entries together: select directory entry / continue on the directory menu or press F7 (the button closure). in order to put up only the current entry, select the actual Elements or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If supported by contradictory file types, a message appears to exist on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you run all entries, a dialogue window with the options will run, phrases and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without being done really changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then takes certain actions with all entries. if a manual operation is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select restart intermittance / continue or press F7. if you haven't stored yet, an appropriate dialogue appears. then execute & kdiff3; his work with the next entry will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a bug it appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to trigger the cause of the problem or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them together again. even if the merge was passed over or not stored, these entries will be handled correctly. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu from & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDifficable...) has now a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files appearing on the specified patterns are displayed in the elemental tree. the default placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. there can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. there can be more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .O.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be specified using a .cvsignal file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignals.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files have a file attribute. in other file systems, a previous file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Elementbaum or not. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. when the option is enabled, files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folder and recursively. (note that & kdiff3;) will not lead to a final slips and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a complete analysis of any file through and shows statistics columns. (the number of deleted, un- white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and considerably slower when it is applied to files containing no text. (specify an appropriate Anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large files across a slow network, it's likely to compare just the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security. please use with caution. this option is set on.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidence of change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal to the same. this option can be useful when copying the change date. please be careful to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronize mode, when two files are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging is so selected, that afterwards both files are identical. the results from merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action. (this is assumed to be uncertain, because the other file is not changed too.) This option is displayed in any case.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version is renamed and receives the original version. if an old backup file is already deleted, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to normal collision single files, not just the merge of whole folder. this option is switched on.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view is visible to the merging single files; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to switch off the window. if you don't want to switch off main window in the window menu, switch between directory and text window between the two opinions.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You may probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, there is also a single file directly, without the folder command. as soon as you store the file, the status is set up and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, however, if you read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio slaves. Kdiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one FTP-server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively undone or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masking. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.) for example has a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol, it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can not be differentiated if a link indicates a file or folder. then, a file is assumed as a link target. (FTP:, FTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or change date. therefore, vary the permissions or change date from the original. (note the option confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reason is currently referred to as a difference-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts to start the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then choose in Kdiff3Part show from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then, dediff3; the names of the original files must exist. then, & kdiff3; the program patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the queror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part 2. please note that it doesn't work if no of the original files exists. also, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is performed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small tool bar and menu. merge or the comparing of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now it's compression) exist. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge together like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and I learned a lot in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers that go this way or going to be so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You've probably compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script. in default, configure / usr / local, but then KDE does not find resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines will be treated as identical, but if only a non-white characters is different, the line is not identical. iF similar lines are next to Each other, this is is but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is obvious to any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. this important information is simply lost, however, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design extra a private file format which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The work is so far too large. you can always restore a specific version through selecting a source A / B / C. for larger quantities, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text is suddenly mentioned; no src left; released and the text can't be extinguished. what does it mean, and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; uses many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use & Kdiff3 functions; you may need to use & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes will be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the Changelog file in the quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & diff3; to compile and install on a system with & KDE; use the following command in the base file of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-you gives the folder to your system installed in the KDE. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automakers are used, you should have no problems at compile. if difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-Removing) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or orbit) add the text from the clipboard at the present cursor position or replace the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to read the folder with the function updates automatically.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. if the target file does not already contain these files. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing after compelling. (the behavior is likely to be amended in a later program version.) This option is switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on selecting the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, lines from the corresponding windows are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present), they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">The default setting is disabled. underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; showing a miniature preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite practical to see the ongoing programs on the workspace, to finish her size, to finish it or move them. this works both within a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces, as well as in current applications. applications can be selected and can even be moved to desktop and others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">The middle mouse button lets you move within & Kpager; movement is possible both within a desktop and other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked out: when on the empty background of & Kpager; it is clicked on an application within & Kpager; however, it also appears the symbol and the name of the application and the entries minimize, maximize, in mind and end.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of mind. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this checkbox is marked, Windows can be moved within the & Kpager; with the middle mouse button on your desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager; the virtual workspace name is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field, you can view the & Kpager; the numbers of virtual workspaces. is it along with name advertised, the names are provided with ordinances, and eg; 1. mind.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of every desktop is also displayed as a background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; if only the empty work space is indicated in order to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard icon and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; published in a 2xn grid, such as from Pager applications in some other Windows-managers; horizontal, all virtual workspace shows in a vertical range, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols, or with their contents. it also runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click on the right mouse button within & Kpager; and subsequent exit of switch switches... enables the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in dialogue settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Do not open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not apply to your system administrator to your system administrator. in this file, you must apply the key windowTransparency mode and apply to that a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click once the mouse curt has a while on the same spot. it is thought to help people who suffer the repetitive strain of the jury (RSI) syndrome, and which each mouse click pains pains. however, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that emerges when clicking the mouse, and helps to use so many people using the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may suffer from pain that related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To put it once again: even if & kmousetool; painful mentions that are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by the desire of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic sources, the result may differ for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; it is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart push is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it emulated the mouse button. move it until the end of the motion before the letting go of the mouse button. in this way, you can run the pulling with pressing mouse buttons. this intelligent sliding requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">Let's go after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; click a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intellect has switched on, the revolting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after suppress the mouse button, before it leaves the mouse button, if there is no need for the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound appears to be delayed, you can reduce the reaction time. open the & kcontrol centre; go on sound & multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider line. there is a sliding sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & kmousetool; started at every start of & KDE; this feature is currently only available under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window frames, please select the respective documentation to find out how to start the program automatically.</seg>

<seg id="2509">At best, use & kmousetool; initially with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should first be turned off. if you are accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later move the smart push.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the response times by & KDE; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click is without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on digits in the browser window, which does not represent a link, does not carry unnecessary reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually rather simple. the trick is that you do not only cleaning the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you have to take out the mouse ball. as that happens, the mouse is different from mouse to mouse. it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the ball. these are located on the sides of the Loches where the ball was inserted. the dirt and the plastering can be scrapped with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system cancels the execution of & kmousetool; if it was just a move-end, means that & kmousetool does not mean that the surgery can no longer stop by letting the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you are able to run yourself a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; reset, and you may continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: when you enter Text, drag & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to make it. however, you can make the mouse on a neutral area of mind, if you do not want to make a missed mouse clicks. safe zones for the mouse pointer is & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shifting, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you deal with it. it's very unlikely to move it into the clipboard and move back to any other action, where you want to move the mouse with pressing mouse buttons. however, there will probably be some problems. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifting if you just start to use & kmousetool; use text instead: perform a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and once again move the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will be played every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click. so, you know exactly, when in the intelligent shifting the delay time begins. but later you can use the intelligent shift without the audible mouse click. but it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & mousetool; the XTest-extension for & X Window must be installed; this should be the case for most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and are set up correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be dragged on all other orders. if the output of the screen Reader is pre-read, orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important messages like & eg; processor is forgetting hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web site can be read with & kmouth; someone can welcome you who just enter the room. & KDE; notifications are also news. read also.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text contracts. any order you encounter from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that use text contracts. text contracts are thought for longer texts that have no particular emphasis.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are operated in queue, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen-Readers, while & ktats; just such a prereading, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen reproduction. they are used on normal warnings, messages, and text contracts, as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter. at the moment there are three kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are implemented as modules. in the future, there can be further kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character pieces replacing parts of a text by text. can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; will be supplied with predefined strings such as: -) by text or for the formatering of news from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert images into another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktops, some XSLT files are contained in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of the different filter has an adjustable rules after which he applied for a language version. if the filter states that its rules does not apply, he will continue the text to the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Set the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is achievable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the optional filter, you can send text to a certain subject, which is set up on the card speaker, or on a speaker with certain features. you can, for example, indicate that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops provide a text to the filters, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the spokesman is selected using the text editor that sends the text to & ktops; send, and the characteristics of the orator on the backcard speaker can be translated to the selected speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any language synthesizer which can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, take the description of synthesizers to the supported languages. look at the website of ktops, according to information which are not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "tool-dispatcher" uses an adaptive module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktops for use any other synthesizers, join the developer team in connection.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not mandatory, but Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "" "" tool-dispatcher. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you purchase the source codes of & ktops, which refer to the source code for kdefiles or select the tarball at present, then install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktops, first check that the tool-dispatcher works properly with your language synthesizer. in addition, you can use the SPD-script file.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktops that uses the program tool dispatcher. the program kttmsgr is designed to be developed so that the device must not be used directly and the SPD-conf script does not need any more.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed in single sentences. the user may continue to recap, repeat or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If you specify an application text to & ktops, for example, it can request a female English speaker for example. if you have set up a speaker, the language English and its sex is female, it will automatically be the best matching speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktops are chosen, you will see a speaker, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on the card speaker, click on to add or edit a speaker to the list or edit, the card-card speaker display is shown. as an example, the module guides will be shown in the following format. for details on the modules, you will find details below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you just need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Choose the character encoding for text, which is passed to Festival. in voices, the & ktops are known, this setting will be done automatically. generally, western languages like Czech or Slovakian use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slides, you can adjust volume, voice speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select a number of controllers and the grey display, you do not allow you to choose the voice of your settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some votes like MultiSyn vote will need several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you are loaded this checkbox, these voices are already loaded with KTTSD, so (with higher memory consumption) the first set will be made faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this junction box cannot be selected, you don't have set up a speaker (or remember to click). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If the checkbox is marked, it is displayed at the Start of kttsmgr. otherwise, it is visible after starting only the symbol kttsmgr in the system segment, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system to preview the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If the checkbox is marked and kttsmgr doesn't run yet, it appears in the system area, once KTTSD reads a text. so, you have the possibility to stop or otherwise control them.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the just working sentence. the speaker-ID represents the column ID on the card speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this map card, you can set special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktats; processed four kinds of language versions:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will be dragged on all other orders. once the output of the screen Reader has been read, orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have priority priority. this stage is important messages like & eg; processor is getting hot. a warning holds the output of news and normal text. these orders will be resumed after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News do the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that says messages. if you have & eg; just a long text on a web site, you can watch with & kmouth; still feel someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen readers, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue long one.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if the introductory sound is active as well as introductory news, the introductory sound will be played in front of the introductory news.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card only apply to normal text contracts. for messages, warnings, and the issues of screen reels there are no particular actions, if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; read notice messages, start cttsmgr and click to notifications. notifications are alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Mark this checkbox to switch the check of & KDE; if this setting is not marked, the other settings are deactivated and & ktops are not read notifications before.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting marks, notifications of which a sound is played, by & ktops. not read.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a speech output, the voice speed, the volume, the gender of voice and pitch. also trademarks for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktats; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, used at the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch is not configured in the festival configuration dialog, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filtering - normal filters and propositional character filters (SDB filters). this can start & ktats, faster with the first set, as only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text order. so you can also stop or cancel the whole text order, even if the language synthesizer does not support them directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here, you see the propositional protection filter. at the first start of & ktops, the default setting filter will be automatically set up. you can change its settings, or add another set limits filters, but it is discoursed.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Easiest to learn to sample the set of speaking selection through sample selection. check out the speech selection contracts, which speaker & ktats, change some properties and check how the choice of the microphone has changed. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is uneffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then start to read more quickly, as only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then order text contracts on board map contracts, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal propositional feature filter is automatically set up when you launch kttsmgr. it can not be removed, only removed. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional recognition filters compare text with a regular expression of proofs and include a tabulatory sign (Decimal code 8) to the propositional limits (decode characters are automatically removed from the filter). note that the standard movement control filters are signatories.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters will never be applied to & KDE; -News (kscreen), warnings, messages or the output of screen reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal movement control filter, you can insert it again by charging the in & ktops; included the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the board selection menu, you can skip the application settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>

<seg id="2738">Use of the passable speaker, which has all the features of a furnished speaking driver. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker. otherwise, select & ktops; otherwise choose & ktats; the speaker, which is originally set the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker properties, by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this property doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this checkbox when the property has priority in front of other features. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the version, this will always be treated as a priority feature. you will probably use this property clearly. if you want to specify the attribute language, it is obvious if you know that a specific application form text in another language as being introduced in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of actors, which is equivalent to the follower below, click on the box button, and then use on speaker, which equals the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is written for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, entry is 0 required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is shut down and punctually; probably, you must still record GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, you may not have a compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another use of music. if I order a text order, freezes & ktops, one. on the & console; appears a message that says: leave to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem exists that conflicts with ALSA are appearing to prevent the same opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice from the Internet. I have installed it and can use them in Festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map audio, there is a setting speed. so this works, the program SOX has to be installed and above the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed will be ignored if & ktats; & HTML; read either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -according to SSML reshaping filter, and put the speaking speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that web pages are read with a female voice. I have set up a female Festival speaker, but & ktats, reads the web pages with a male voice ago.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so festival no mistakes produced, the xsl file raises the xsl file to converting SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same is also true for VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a own character set filter and now I can go in & ktops; no longer a whaling business or go back. on the carton, orders will be displayed only from a proposition. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Interactions (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolone) are not allowed to filter out. use a filter for propositional recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture) ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure the modules for GStreamer are registered by calling on the use of GStreamer in & ktops. please call the command register. (HTTP: / / gstream.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users are living in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music simultaneously and start a text. & ktops, even if you want a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With stand-up in July 2005, aKode does not support real breaks. if you order a text order in & ktops, the current set is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program SOX is used for the general attitude of the speaking speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can install SOX with the apt-get install SOX. the program is already included in most & Linux; CDs are already included.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual describes the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrol centre; that enables the administration of network interfaces, the routings and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrol centre; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single integrated, integrated surface. the & kcontrol centre; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolCentre; displayed. network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; internet & network network settings in & kmenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their driver must have already functioning properly and configured, thus & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and the customization of the network properties are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed for the network hardware and other devices to install and installed. network appliances later added, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">Module network settings will be loaded when selecting the network settings in & kcontrolCentre; -index is selected. when starting the module, this module tries to automatically detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the number is offered. it is the platform used to select the distribution of distribution and Releasestand. by marking the setting non-once-demand, the definition can be taken permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Modify the network settings are only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can proceed to the right bottom of the module. it's the input of password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The module's full functionality is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface provides management of the network's network tools. all available network devices are displayed. the following functions can be carried out by the tab network interface:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Set up network interface settings can set up by selecting the required device in the list and click the button on the button. set up in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button on the button Advanced settings displays the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the choice of automation, the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address will be carried out for the system. the DHCP- or BOOTP Server will be required. in the selection list may be selected either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, you can set the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address you have to specify the desired TCP / IP address.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface in the booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the console, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on if required. switching on each network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off. switch on a activated network device is performed by selecting from the list and click interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The IP address of the host in the local subnet defines the physical connection to remote networks and will be used as standard for TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnetworks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If computers are more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A machine with DNS support will be replaced by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the calculator http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS is dissolves this name into an IP address like 123,45.678,90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator to the name resolution part of the riding solution enables a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a contract and incrementor for gradation in the list with knocking up or herunder in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button to add... from the group calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the dialog for the New Nameserver.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the DNS server address and then click on the button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select one entry and then click the Edit button.... It will be the dialog Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of incorporate hosts describes the computer-to-IP address mode for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily in the booting when there is no DNS servers available. in small, completed networks, it can replace DNA servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list is well-known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported. this is still the same version of IP should replace 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Edit.... The dialog will add the new alias is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host computer, and click the button to add. if the well-known hosts has several alias names, adding button to add several times and enter the alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select one entry of a well-known host computer from the list and choose Edit.... The dialog is printed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done with the following tasks, then by clicking OK, the list of static hosts is updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings specified in module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, it must be set in a & console (the following command).</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; it's http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's simply download the rpm package and will install in a & Console; with rpm, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient; not, but also the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to compile users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; it should make the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology are given, in the second all files are discussed by & knetworkconf; change configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can't alter further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of PCs into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never found great spread. IPv6 is expected in the near future. therefore, this description is concentrating on the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is ascertained. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the network administrator to view or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When you use a own (home) network, IP address should be selected from a specially reserved area for this purpose to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below will not be forwarded to the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course access to internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gate.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used for smaller networks. the area is large enough for networks, up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all the machine participants are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route that is second the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the standard route is needed for the IP redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine. normally the address is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files you are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes altered at DSL connections, so it is not surprising when in the case of active DSL connections, another content is defined to be found there.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the band back and reads the prestressing of the band. recognize & kdat; the checkbox on the tape does not, you'll be asked whether the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & dat; the checkbox, searches after the appropriate index on your plate. cannot be found, you will be asked whether the band index should be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol of tape drives, to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the content of the band can now be searched for the band by folding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the throw of the banana, first the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; seen by a change in the symbol for the band that the integration is solved for the band, and will be displayed in the status bar a corresponding message. the band can now be kicked off without any danger.</seg>

<seg id="2901">A bandaging have to formatted before you can use to store data. this process does not match the formatting at & kdat; it needs to be formatted before you can formatted from the tape of & kdat; however, it is intended to formatted a formatting of the tape ahead, DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name, and the capacity goes & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the tape are lost, the tape becomes automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup, you need to select the careful files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a folder in the local file tree. only this file or the folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in local file tree with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be secured.</seg>
<seg id="2907">With the right mouse button, click on the local file tree and select the backing menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been introduced, the dialog can open to backup. in this dialog, you can test the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog can be backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select one file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only be the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>

<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a bunch. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">With the right mouse button, click a file or folder in one of the archives and select the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog automatically appears to restore. in this dialogue, you can check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoring, the dialogue will be reproduced. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexes by using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can add the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">A fuse profile with the straight-selected files and the default settings will be created. you can make the following settings for an ensuring profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, in which the backup should take place. the list of overseen files will automatically be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folder, which are listed under backup files, the files that are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. file, which are stored on other file systems, can be viewed separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental Backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files that have changed ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine changes since last year's credentials.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the Settings menu via the KDat menu... set up in the Settings menu. the following settings can be set:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device node for tape drive (usually / dev / Tape). this path must assign on the non-rewinding variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transfers & dat; before the tape is bound to load the drive. with some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The option has been switched on, tries to lock and lock; perhaps this attitude will not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & kdat; automatically the band is ejected automatically. do not use this option at Floppy-streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, tries to change & dat; the hardwarding block size can change for tape drive. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you must notify & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, writes a file at the beginning of the band. this file should only prove a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the name: seconds, where the host name is the complete name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that was formatted since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat / file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU / tar. even other tar versions should work unless there is no incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup. this icon is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your calculator is doing in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can receive information about your system or where the system is deposited on the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog splits; experienced users have quick access to information on problems related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore try to deliver some extended functions to be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screen photo, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with their help to filter the individual protocol-lines of a protocol-file easily and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the system tries to open the system log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system log. will not appear to you with a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system-footed. the protocol files are normally found in the folder / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filter bar in order to filter for a chosen criterion or in the default settings. in the default settings the drop-line will be displayed next to the selected filter. then, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contained the string of the filter search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point of course. the string of the filter search term will then select the column process only with entries in the chosen column. select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent from this process or have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a significant color as protocol lines of the level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off options.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want only to display certain process (e.g. in the Systemprotocol or in the cron protocol), you can see the process identification process (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a certain command as such as the samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to view all new addition to the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows for displaying more protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a window, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website based on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.or.Dort you will find more recent information about the source sources of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folders of the & KDE; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init develops quickly to the standard for controlling the system in the & Linux; world. this is why it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to enter into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone may try to implement a machine on System V Init without a new installation and new format. that's why you must be sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differ from the BSD content that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start at the peak of the system or when switching to another Runtime. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not enough use for it. you can also try a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for the program init and starts the first he will find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can throw a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can repair / etc / inittab of hand and change the 3. if you have done something through, then you will repair it by restart the system and run:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start with all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l enter in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written that there is a argument like starting and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts under the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script will be called to the argument. if it includes an S, the script will start using the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to establish machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server runlevel, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; can also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other hand-set is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six Runes to start at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can shift scripts out between Runners or change the position within a level by removing it elsewhere. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if you pull out an entry from the availability of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you select this in a new range. in order to copy it only to a new Runlevel, you need to select copying from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and even if the same entry already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a entry may sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting order numbers of the rendering entries before attempting to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown in the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the various workplaces (Available System services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting code or the name of one entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tab button to accept the input button, to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. for default, they are produced by & ksysv; otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksyrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have been experimented with standard Runners, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter on the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services can be launched in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distributions, but alas no standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution box: please verify that all configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (as & eg; Apache and httpd) just stop without message when their configuration files are not present or incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send us information about Runes, so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the Chapter Adjustment of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have done any changes, you have to save them. either you use the appropriate symbol of toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window is made of two card cards, the user group and user group list. to edit the user or the desired group with double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have done advanced system settings. only if you can make customized system settings. for example, if you can make customized settings (Quota), you will make custom settings. other card cards appear, if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd installed as in BSD portable devices.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password will appear if shadow passwords, or example / etc / master.passwd installed as in BSD -uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least a embedded file system space limitation (Quota) is enabled and initialized (can be seen here for any user parameters, but the number of limitations in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field of space constraints</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Card group provides information on the group of selected users. the standard group, which belongs to the user, will be found in the Primeric Group box. furthermore, the user can become member in other groups by marking these in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select addition to the user or group or click on the matching button in the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the lilo Bootmanager, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to the default operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, modify operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
