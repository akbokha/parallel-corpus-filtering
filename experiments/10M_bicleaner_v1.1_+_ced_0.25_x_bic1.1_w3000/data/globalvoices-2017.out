although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
how many of my generation I grew up with American films , American authors have been reading and operated with American authors .
in fact , this land had a profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist for the American film .
when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the Grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , the Supreme Court of Justice of a Oil @-@ Magn@@ um , who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was tra@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was it as if this is the absolute Truth , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , only strengthened my admi@@ ration for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming , that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people .
I even had a very shy love letter writing about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as it goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain , as it was so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declared his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ American and Women .
nevertheless people responded to his testimony and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with Republican Presi@@ dential elections , the highest number formed by the party became the nominal candidate ever .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not make Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ torate in line with people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , people from all over the world , a deeply belie@@ ver , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ uman hasn &apos;t agreed with the present editor of the Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the present editor of the Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ag@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to watch the Phoenix S@@ uns &apos; at the game .
Tr@@ umps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced for Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my family of hosts , who actually treated me like her son .
she still fits with the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of the American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much with my career .
those people , who em@@ bodied values , deep@@ ened my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump went up his way to the nominated Republican Presi@@ dential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counter to its limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either divided his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ smus because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ assi@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and suggests an in@@ ability to understand those who take care of a different way .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be considered .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them know , have voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that dis@@ ap@@ points her ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contemp@@ t to those who looks different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties ; &quot; pu@@ n from white to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , what a great Van Jones called it , has just killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background can you always have , America is welcome every welcome .
for this country , as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would be possible nowhere else in the world .
with the choice Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says : to hell with vers@@ atility , religious freedom and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ru@@ d@@ der , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , is my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd collap@@ ses .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone who isn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not that of America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ uman Country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no more space in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children can &apos;t spoil their love for music by tr@@ ash .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city Cat@@ e@@ ura in common ?
the music that is played in both places does not only change the life of children , but also has a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for some years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musical Academy ) has been playing in the community : one out of children and adults of existing Symph@@ onie Orchestra , which with their musical instruments an opportunity for over@@ coming their poverty .
a musical school with 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the church , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs fire .
however , this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , which started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hop@@ ef@@ oot .
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the gu@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero playing the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the highest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital , which is produced from recovered waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itated s@@ lu@@ sts , viol@@ ins , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass , guit@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all manufactured from waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez reminds himself a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura to the starting time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se , and we did not know about the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown somewhat , which he never had seen before : a violin was made out of tr@@ ash .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and that the Recy@@ cled Orchestra is playing .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ scape Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest as the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ Ca@@ Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspi@@ rational drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music before Pope Francis :
this East African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild fishing industry is strug@@ gling .
this post , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published specifically for international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the publication is in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared content .
in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Li@@ berian waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised and much incl@@ ined to welcome a perpet@@ rator of this species to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seychelles have rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to share it a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Premier was surrounded by countries that just refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries agency . he is part of a team that discovered the ship once and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the region &apos;s waters : it did not succeed there to catch fish there .
at the end , however , it was forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar , who had driven the prime minister of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries to work together and work together . they exchange information and stand each other in where there is illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track . the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm the chemical balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled once through bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , with the information between individual countries , the actions occurred nowadays in real time , tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to identify ships , which are fishing in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious rides - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fish licence , where they were on the way and maybe even if they have a fir@@ end@@ ent .
countries that are against illegal fishing permits can then refuse to provide the acceptance of such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there &apos;s significant financial losses for the owners , which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a ber@@ lain company who is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa , and F@@ ISH has also supported .
a closed front
the already known platform was created to win over 20 million USD of lost revenues , who lose eight members of the H@@ ISH 2015 network each year due to the illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry , attrac@@ ting the area of commercial fishing trips around the world . these were also illegal fishermen .
among other practices among other things include campaigns such as the sailing under false flag , fake license documents , speci@@ fying imagination , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make itself the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once , a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You must@@ n &apos;t walk my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and precisely this legal conclusion tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front works .
F@@ ISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships since its inc@@ eption .
it has exposed criminal networks that had distributed licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identification and found it to be persecuted and found floating vessels .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for com@@ b@@ ating crimes , F@@ ISH may share information on illegal fishing across huge distances and received .
some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that will help the F@@ ISH should be susp@@ icious ships more precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evol@@ ving , also helps to accum@@ ulate the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO , who also offers technical support with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automated identification systems , where@@ with they can no longer be ort@@ able of satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to help discrimin@@ ating ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oce@@ ana . a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed on the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accum@@ ulate with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this will simply make sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only find crimin@@ als but they do d@@ eter them as well .
ships which were used to over@@ ride a license before , and hardly expected to count with consequences , now know that they are being monitored .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH has now sold a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors located there on board in tow@@ er@@ nets , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries notice these achievements . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are going to disappear yearly several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing .
in 2015 , six countries joined together with the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force , and now they are fighting the illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; With security , the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia announced its first major triumph : in October , it was in Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was travelling under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and they were already forbidden .
the ship was also prohibited in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with the Take of Meas@@ ure@@ ment Against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed towards illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative work mode of the oceans actually works throughout the world &apos;s oceans . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the Environment , Techni@@ que and Nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , the New York Times and in The Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to rec@@ ap@@ point the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela will only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of opposition to a referendum , the Vene@@ tians responded to the negotiations held on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were assembled on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ ad@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate will also run in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located in the central country Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which is noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the official president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Díaz , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles in the context of the government &apos;s context :
within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a serious and far reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to a new governance .

the call was commented on Twitter including the following :

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The back of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the fair@@ yt@@ ale , which are published in real @-@ time , reveals overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most commonly shared images shows an demonstr@@ ators who calls through the patron depic@@ ts : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she cri@@ es out of the Vene@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter suggest images that relate of disp@@ utes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police oppression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own statement before police and armed advoc@@ ates .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts because you could see anything else , what many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic makes the turn , which forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for an official procedure - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of countless individuals on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your ten@@ si@@ bl@@ es@@ ho@@ oting !

other these protests as a further step in the fight against a government based on a little bit against the disast@@ rous economic crisis and would rather be able to inf@@ ring@@ ing critical voices :
they have taken so much - but also the fear !
the fair@@ yt@@ ale always take more about frequency and intensity .
some Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry for participating in a strike instead of working or to go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in Córdoba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined for crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
starting with the burden , such names as his father bear to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret secret for himself .
in the situation , I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ enta .
as a child at 15 , you don &apos;t notice that it is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I was not able to recognize that my father was a thief , fol@@ kl@@ ist and mur@@ der@@ ers .
he had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ official . during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was a deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the mag@@ nit@@ ude of atro@@ cities that he had seen as young , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child has chosen a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went into the sports hall . I had married myself with a boy , mar@@ tial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and several days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me on to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you are married to one of the ERP .
beware , that they do not lead you one day and I have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labor Party of Argentina .
that is why he prohibited me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father loved me .
on the military base , I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers that heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ So the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father gave me a total of four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood there .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small piece wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver .
on that day , I went to the other hand of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with guard .
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
so the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in , and saw a song , being tortured in man .
it looked like a dirt @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they set the end of a cable . the other end has been attached to the body of the person who was running there .
they fed a people with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the place there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much harm to someone else ?
&quot; I knew that those people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried them .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lopez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilian , who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were down with the face down - everyone was cra@@ mmed at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people stopped working on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father observed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I replied &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that those people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were called Off@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed a man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survi@@ ving the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina was charged to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la memorial , led by the former torture chambers .
the road that you came in here is also the way where you came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ duction .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came , that they should be laid .
this was a lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the sho@@ ots of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Output &apos;
my father brought all kinds of things home with home .
at that time , at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war is a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military sign that you ab@@ using an enemy who has been fighting .

but if you come into a house and the fridge , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... steal , then that &apos;s no war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , chief of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a crimin@@ als , and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who sti@@ pul@@ ate cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded me , and struck me , and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and bring you loose .
we don &apos;t need any other !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a picture of the back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ out pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a complic@@ ity in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay a burden to me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the bodies are the last ab@@ h@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you only have children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
it is developed further and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I went so far to say :
so well , you ex@@ hum@@ ed during the dictatorship of people . but what the bodies disappear ?
why children de@@ duct children ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
you could have been able to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill those people . but to make their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not even families , to whom one could be given their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the bodies are the last ab@@ h@@ ous acts that one can do with a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of the prisoners .
they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my father .
but there anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just to put it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I myself was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 crimin@@ als , including my father .
the thought to show my Father , was created during a talk , when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly , and asked myself , why all the bu@@ oy@@ ancy of Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly def@@ ending , they were doing well .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 , I re@@ funds the first display .
finally , I recognized that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can tell me that I am vo@@ i@@ red . I finally have told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest nor before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 criminal charges : among them severe , un@@ lawful independence in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture and subsequent death sequence in five cases and a fall of ab@@ duction of a under 10 year old child .

the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the judgment of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the Historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process involves crime against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the Tribunal sentenced him to life sentences in 28 cases and sentenced to life sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

all the accused were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police members and civil employees .
in June 1976 , Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidnapped and brought to La Per@@ la with his pregnant woman .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a prime factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court rules is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations having been working on justice for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was built , so that a memorial was built there , which now is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible car drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in K@@ YO@@ TO , in which one can extend his license .
the photo was widespread in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers introduced a newly opened centre where you can extend their driving licence , last month witnesses of a very mis@@ fortun@@ ate translation .
on a sign the Japanese word ( ko@@ eb@@ elt sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means that &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; means , &quot; perhaps - perhaps also with a great rear wheel &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible car drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 @-@ 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original pictures from Joshua Lev@@ ine , divided into social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a Cy@@ ot@@ os Cy@@ ot@@ os . it was also the local newspapers that made the local newspapers .
in Kyoto , the daily newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Holmes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ law@@ ed English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate but also gramm@@ atically not the correct designation &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police pre@@ judi@@ ced in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text , which they had received from trans@@ lators and that the translation was not checked for its correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , that older people felt due to in@@ adequate correc@@ ting ( the translation ) on our side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news agency J @-@ cast News put together somewhat more detailed in the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounces as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , nationwide in accidents are involved in accidents , is quite a reason to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the senior citizens caused 1.@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this raises the share of 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the number of deaths caused by seniors in the same period increased .
the name not so @-@ called repor@@ ters included in the article published by article Comments on the Light that show what pre@@ ju@@ dice some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So is the translation actually not correct , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that a real translation is real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; spreads so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of trans@@ lators are mani@@ fold .
for example , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text , and to transfer active voice knowledge to him in the target language .
the latter requires active rest of the target language - something that is in the parent &apos;s practices . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the starting language - should be native speakers .
thus a French native speaker should translate into English by the French into English - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue , who could produce translations into English . this may be missing understanding for the transfer , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English language lear@@ ners who want to learn Japanese .
some companies that have no foreign employees themselves , have yet made confirmation into fir@@ sth@@ and . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be trans@@ lators , doesn &apos;t matter how good or bad his language skills actually are .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions , which are created by machine translation , show that this technique can not substitute for long no human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages altogether .
some of the strange English cou@@ ps in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints , which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ lec@@ tic reasons - not to be read or not understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless . but of big companies or by the government that have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect careful translations .
the city of Kyoto uses a reliable source of its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and en@@ forcement action on the Internet and Television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users claimed that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online broad@@ caster .
later , other users found that the Internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV have no more access .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out recordings of protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ position@@ ist groups that re@@ jects the Government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament , and the Parliament &apos;s tasks was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos Díaz , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is being attached , and recommended to use the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web sites of Venezu@@ elan providers are again closed .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant since 2014 when reporting on protests . at that time , the Commission threatened them to report with pen@@ alties and closure if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; force to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable television and informative national television channels , I have signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ cer@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ caster . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings .
previous research in the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet provider will sometimes use DNS . it is a technique that , through which the DNA @-@ server requests would answer certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers a bug or denied the request by calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS sperm : @ el@@ ong@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
upon V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera name Elvis Flo@@ res was arrested and carried out in prison in Caracas .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was detained in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV was broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this will keep the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ean access to multimedia coverage on the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will be slaves to slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testim@@ oni@@ als of other cri@@ adi@@ tas , who became the same as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is an abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of the authors .
the article is part of a series with the title &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ ban que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , cas@@ ual schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where they did not have to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before she graduated from university degree , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adic , one called in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to a different , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an apprentic@@ eship and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for it countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within a contract you can &apos;t raise .
this is described as a cri@@ b@@ az@@ go practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization , which fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ f@@ az@@ go - gathered testim@@ onies , re@@ acted and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call the things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude , that is vacc@@ inated with cri@@ adi@@ tas , guarantees silence in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ f@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there , on the other hand , the family , who do their daughter in the belief that they do so their training , improve their position in society and making &quot; something out of itself &quot; can be translated to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who opens the girl with itself and justi@@ fies the exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that wouldn &apos;t have an apprentic@@ eship , and perhaps he would be star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret places in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , got a face . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of sharp stro@@ kes . shortly after that she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adic in the budget of former military @-@ affiliated Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the Department of Department .
Mar@@ ín is living with them in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira was defeated by a stick to Mar@@ ín until they were le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they empha@@ sized that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of cri@@ b@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they signed the Cri@@ f@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much simpler , un@@ punished the rights of children to hurt .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an initial analysis of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who had been sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pointing out - if for the first time in history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to trial .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ tic@@ tas are exploited only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , who worked in her father , had to sign up bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father .
her brothers had to go all work and started selling sweets on the road or on the market cand@@ y in order to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time so that it remained even time to learning .
she ris@@ ked every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , p@@ umping the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she returned home and had time for learning .
the more she was ready with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never had star@@ ving , but he did not get unlimited food . &quot; I took more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge . &quot; she reminds me .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the owner , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to some evenings of the land@@ lord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , beside him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dictator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retained her for intelligent , but he didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believed there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a that belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak at home again their native language Guar@@ an@@ í &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her Lord feared that she would allow her to lose her again , she explains .
her , however , was perfectly clear that she was paid for everything they paid from them , with their hard work paid .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about , mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans to whom cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite anyone at home . I had no circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I had belonged to any group .
isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the Society Ap@@ proves the Cri@@ t@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view job opportunities for cleaning personnel and child labour in Paraguay .
the ad@@ ministr@@ ator of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city secretary in the district As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
for learning .
please go to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; lights &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a fine @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the national inner that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author of the display switched itself once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thanks , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adic , as long as yet ? ) , a collection of testim@@ oni@@ als of former Cri@@ tic@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice of early history ) , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í people , and the native people who had to pay tribute until the Spanish conqu@@ ers in Paraguay was still willing to justify that many girls and boys will be@@ fall into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian @-@ users social media to register for the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changes by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees recently voted &quot; draft regulations regarding the use of social networks in respect to the use of social networks . &quot;
if it is accepted by the Parliament , users and social media must be registered in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would then be arranged to provide civil rights , citizens and citizens to share social media .
within six months with adop@@ ting the law , user @-@ users would have to register with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it hur@@ ts to do this , this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six parks , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video message and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is passed since it is assumed , as the Egyptian authorities are supposed to set up the user &apos;s user experience . it is un@@ clear , as those who make up those who are unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a useful user name and a password to get through the Fire@@ wall that the Facebook is blocked .
this could mean that Egypt plans to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians , to submit information on their identity to access the network .
however , it is not known that such plans stand out .
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( based on German @-@ conducting research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; says Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and understanding any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they for@@ ci@@ bly control physical and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I take them seriously , it means that they must request a strong surveillance system to request citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to monitor citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and also to bring them to a law@@ suit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative mandate and the constitutional committees , before it goes into a plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mem@@ art in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that there is no separate nar@@ ration on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against Cy@@ ber Crime , in which a life @-@ long sentence for those intended to be found guilty on &quot; public order to thre@@ aten &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

up in the top of the Kurdistan region in the nor@@ theastern Iraq region , the veter@@ inary surgeon H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation in Nature decided to protect the European @-@ European le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less lo@@ ot , endangered .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem . &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is available .
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually is low and goes towards zero . as the team is therefore fixed in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera @-@ all , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained Bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of their country , which is not only composed of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field trials for six years and involved in educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is making sure that protection zones for wild animals be established in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , a documentary that was responsible for the nor@@ theastern Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years has been affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theastern , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to van@@ ish , because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished from the map .
again , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , so on that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o show from local point of view which progress has been reached six years after , in order to rebuild the life of local companies .
the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and also survey results of those affected themselves .
residential construction in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by the end of December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( by a note of the left @-@ screen , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
at the same time , I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fukushima is the final light .
still , six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ bor@@ ates ( by the left , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) res@@ ett@@ lement to final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , almost 80,000 people were forced to live in per@@ taining housing .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which have been resi@@ ded after the disaster in comfort shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
according to the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools , who were affected by the disaster , have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures are much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now re@@ active again in Fukushima , only 30 percent of the fish@@ eries were restored to their operations .
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land had caught large scale .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fukushima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destruction of Fukushima , lying in the &quot; Nuclear Power zone &quot; .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but also Fukushima happened far off .
the tourist taxes in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the disaster . Fukushima , however , can only feature 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it has become more difficult to gain their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the indigenous population prepared on the next big earthqu@@ akes ?
in order to determine a full picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and , as did their feel toward the tsun@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the resident population has taken measures to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents think that still hasn &apos;t been done enough in cat@@ astrop@@ hes .
as it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention , also to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated Fukushima .
Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture also had to be a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were more than 23 000 people , back after Fukushima , had been moved to long @-@ lasting houses .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of its home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hes , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which still has to come back in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ xim@@ ately , are older than 50 years old . they must compete in proper building projects , because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima , with massive construction projects . here , it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come from other countries , which speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , it is often noticeable that more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , extend our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look forward to that global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat subjects that get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to anyone about language and country boundaries .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa is thinking about how to return to the music the lack of joint language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time that they worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looking back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photograph .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care station : last Friday a police officer had struck him at a protest rally in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of prot@@ esters took part in a protest rally against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors executed him on Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also recognize the face of police officers , who attacked with a ra@@ vine . the man was identified by Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
following the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás provided that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the incident by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , how he performs in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his whi@@ p on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer will be beaten by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole supp@@ ression would therefore be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz since Lu@@ z , told how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police officers and several sanitary units shortly thereafter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video of the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also immer@@ sed in social networks .
on the bottom of the clip one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to keep part of the cost of medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
towards police force . &quot;
the drawing was split into social networks several times .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political force : here , the activist of Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me was murdered by his father , because he was sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in Sec@@ ond@@ ary , and here we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who had been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who had attacked him with a whi@@ p on his face .
police handles
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which there came to brutal police demonstrations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen put protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rub@@ ber@@ some and tear gas .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to aband@@ on violence against prot@@ esters .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street protests have f@@ eig@@ ned by pushing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a cereb@@ ral glass windows to illustr@@ ate their cover @-@ pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o prefer a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken windows than the protests of thousand people who serve the defense of a specific case .
this must be recognized even if you are stri@@ ving against any form of damage .
even here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; is a wei@@ rd , un@@ disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical actions of the military police are linked by headlines with the demonstr@@ ators &quot; prot@@ esters on the confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
those of Un@@ induced Lost villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the legislation of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso made almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba . ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Community Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a Central - in Spanish Zu@@ ck@@ eri@@ tif - well known , regardless of what there are no notable sugar be@@ ers locally .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar tube factories .
after the suc@@ rose , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants remained , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old made of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some rarely change the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes every day to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ v@@ eter@@ er who opens every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis is rob@@ bed in the sugar tube industry .
he stopped working in the East of the region of sugar tube factories , which are after a long in@@ active time , because they became preserved .
that was something he was not expected .
N@@ ene reminds us exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resistance to pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , I@@ ne@@ ff@@ iciency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news could have been a motive for the country in some decades , but the bad faith are not a curiosity more .
why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and is hardly competitive in the country .
initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ ves that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plant@@ ations and sugar crisis in the global market .
nonetheless , the sugar price increased by about one decade again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural spec@@ tively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar @-@ export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come down with safety in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process of re@@ structure began in the sugar industry .
during the following years , a total of 98 sugar factory factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all of those questioned are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was officially distributed documents , which would only be removed in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any decision .
from then on the responsibility and the letters were always more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money , &quot; he as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years of age , waits for reti@@ ring in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , where building he helped , involved .
with each of them he did , he dis@@ figured one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important work@@ station was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases no alternatives for working and services , which were generated in the municipalities in which they were located , were created .
we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present person saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use , everything went well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar tube factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the People &apos;s parish Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich discovered that many things change , but not always for better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better , when they began to un@@ zip it , they stopped listening to the road leading to asph@@ alted , this dis@@ advant@@ ageous other establishments .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories .
they were made to spare parts .
without future perspectives , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory created , whose production is not even served for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the plant Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .

they have been watching him for ten years .
N@@ ene is about 65 years old in retirement , not because he is lacking in power , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express itself and receive its own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young@@ sters of First Nations communities in all Canada are involved with topics that are important for them . they do well with hip hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , mobile sound studios are available directly at schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were directed by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The North@@ Stars .
the workshop will contribute to the fact that the young participants in our conversations are as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever the sense does .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main character .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the district of the Kit@@ z@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not explained .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the theme of a video player to conv@@ ey how important the acquisition of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by the glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters of the first Nations have not always su@@ preme .
in the following song the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved here received some help of Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the rop@@ he is at disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes , I feel myself , as no one would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on the earth my days
that is the day that you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and forward as well as our youth
so , you can do this , for what purpose is the Creator

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located close to the entrance , near the entrance , sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( hold a note , &quot; Plas@@ tics models of dishes &quot; ) served by every food that is served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there is a variety of these small companies making those plastic dishes produced by the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they do not even notice them anymore . a new trend is transformed , however , in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ g@@ it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in the special sale : new with plastic ri@@ pped cell@@ ed bands , such as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artists were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ate mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ x fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essays will increasingly become w@@ aking up .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell @-@ support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile support .
also , this part is manufactured in Tokyo for the Tokyo Station .

a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of fighting against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking in Mexico , they are appearing regularly in statistics . however , this is not reflected in the mag@@ nit@@ ude of human tragedy that brings the struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ells , th@@ ron@@ ged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks to the mour@@ ners or to the churches which have learned to live with pain .
behind every body , behind each bone fund , behind each bone fund , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds perhaps will never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) is set to give up a voice and stories of people who directed the battle between the law en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organiz@@ ational crimes can not only be feared by our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ icking and so many municipalities have to go many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells of that stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father that seeks every weekend hidden graves after his son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father in only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ews . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pri@@ est : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today on the task that we have asked to go , go to the graves after the people who loved us . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electro@@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should return again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentic@@ eship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is also with me here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she won &apos;t pay them out because they require a death @-@ certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co , &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leaders .
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a director of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter in which form it appears :
I already know illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism for some years now .
I have over every day at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for crimin@@ ology , or acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be equal or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is big . and it is not normal that people talk about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
to me , as if they have fallen those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories to blo@@ t numbers in a statistic will be .
the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; so@@ aked . &quot;
I think they &apos;re trying to agree that they are spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Four Days Ex@@ press@@ ings in the Main Event : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with the threats of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how armed crimin@@ als spo@@ iled for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
she finished her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will de@@ duct or kill you .
I asked myself in these horri@@ ble days if weeping would solve my deep root feelings , but the reply is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a &quot; generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the mar@@ gins of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Bryan is a father@@ less and he tells about how to cook the egg , potatoes , tortillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he rel@@ ates the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy to all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five , she told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he saw just several blocks from his home , the bloody dead body of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence committed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and Government of the United States government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day .
these are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that can leave organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories still live in view of new headlines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ liosis , whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades , in a comprehen@@ sible manner .
when a picture worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; by Flick@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages where he is linked , include pictures where violence is represented .
the factor check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or to exp@@ ose a fake .
but how is the years that has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pass on .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it has been used mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria .
however , it thro@@ ws questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank @-@ car crosses the village San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , Ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the war of Africa , Africa &apos;s second biggest country had been neglec@@ ted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous block@@ ades , having been difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , it fell victim to the filling station .
government officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a cinema in the vicinity , which was full of people who gra@@ ze the soccer world championship .
houses were scattered and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the dis@@ infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows ranks of a stolen body , which are str@@ ing@@ ed on the ground while they have a look at them .
but the story doesn &apos;t end its end .
over the years , the same picture taken over several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but they fal@@ sely attributed to trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the escaped Nig@@ erian villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities , before whom they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down , and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite imag@@ ery the follow @-@ up time could be presented .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ resolved , but the army rule in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nig@@ eri@@ as and the trial of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here , the picture comes from the DRC again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
indeed , this in@@ correct use of the image from the DR Congo is only documented in a number of errors ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge was also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee stro@@ kes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported some of the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared as the following which brought these descriptions out with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news side , which was fal@@ sely claimed by President My@@ An@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an . in addition , mon@@ k and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DRC to investigate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AFP as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein this statement , but had not been related to the picture from the DRC in connection .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false cou@@ plings date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse &quot; picture search , &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ cher has found 344 images of 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DRC .
they come from a pre@@ m@@ ash private parties , platforms social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , so others have tried to exp@@ ose the f@@ ences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have taken examples of the use of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . by doing so , we want to represent the range clearly than the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples included in the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other in some cases ) .
here are some cases , which can now be opened completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
a country example of false cou@@ pl@@ ets of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
orange @-@ related countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available to the examples of for@@ gery or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in Grey are examples , according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information available via the Tin@@ tin , probably also counter@@ f@@ issu@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image of the DRC was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed in Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City will not only tell the mis@@ carriage , but also discussed the mis@@ use of the image from the DRC in connection with Nigeria and further questions concerning the intention of the people and the involved trage@@ dies ( in the DRC and beyond ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nigeria : Nigeria : Nigeria &apos;s in@@ discrimin@@ ti@@ anos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn Christians ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , is identified as the Christian part of the village .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where not known is whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
contrary to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one here , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; they clearly do not have any pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who di@@ spro@@ ve this .

Iran , 2012 .
a Association of the students of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in N@@ asi@@ m &apos;s news agency and used to illustr@@ ate the picture of the DRC .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo was shared as proof of the attacks of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo , with a part of a Twe@@ et , the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ acre and on the other hand , the statement of a blo@@ gger , the claims that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , del@@ ectable , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Government of Myanmar published a judge for what they came as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this decision which was issued exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech and extrem@@ ist groups are used to rule out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often widely distributed by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; fair@@ yt@@ ale with terrace with high @-@ level ly@@ tic acid culture . &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news side claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein being cleared out in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am were published by the now deleted , the Catholic near An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , explicitly stated that the picture was not taken by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it portra@@ ys a &quot; similar d@@ ull attack . &quot;
when the picture later became in circulation by the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there was links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo comes along with this T@@ wit@@ t@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ b@@ anded a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that took place suspected in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as test@@ ament to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times are ad@@ ored ) . but the messages that were associated with this were not included in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre in circulation , discussion forums like this one here on Vietnamese and declared it to the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
from the embassy where the picture was included in the DRC , the Clar@@ et@@ tin missionaries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced .
there are other confirmed examples of in@@ correct use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
for other accounts , ag@@ gregation and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gray ) , Tin@@ tin has also no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan , and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date post@@ mark ) exist on the we@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they possess an image file in relation to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frame ) that pass through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussion on the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is valued at a European or French life .
religion can understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers don &apos;t give this images longer faith .
with social media , there are tiny people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally used to practice water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of error and fal@@ seh@@ ood that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and tasted the real horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that this returns from pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images and viewer des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze and viewer des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as those study , which effect the non@@ violent media on it , to help others ) .
while there are some sort of non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think about this situation in which a picture suggests about what is actually solved from the context or completely mis@@ use species .
however , a false random@@ ness should also be considered as internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons was used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ avoid@@ able ) stri@@ ves to provide language fans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
such words are in each language : they express certain situations or emotions , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example , Spanish ch@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but everyone resist stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in every attempt to an easy translation .
one word or expression is not sufficient , why a complete explanation , and sometimes somewhat context needed to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist von &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find out words from the V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u language , such as :
&apos;@@ v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Get you in recognition of your parents in recognition of your parents , how to stri@@ ve for your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after the cold days in the sun has dar@@ ed .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes , as we want to analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; un@@ err@@ able &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite photos here .

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is presently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon that ends at the end of May are caused by strong rain sei@@ zu@@ res the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country on the banks .
following an opinion from the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are killed because of the floods and sl@@ amm@@ ers .
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 safe stay of stay .
the rainfall caused the rainfall on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas decreased slowly .
health and hygiene per@@ cent@@ ages represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
floods in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water volumes of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ ial crisis , Save the Children after another rainfall are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded because of the water over@@ flowing water of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has made five aircraft for rescue activities and another five are made to transport deliveries to their residents in their flooded villages .
also different organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ IC@@ TI@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if you need any search and rescue teams for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all , to don@@ ate dry food and food @-@ necessary goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ung@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ Command @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the App , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ence Center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me conducted a &quot; flood relief &quot; key , which allowed users allowed to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then rel@@ ayed to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ian Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat @-@ related activities caused by flood and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring inhabitants in need of security and help assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka has therefore imp@@ acted the long way until recovery of the norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .

the use of the t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend .
I trust her four year old daughter , she entrusted her children to me ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we are still calling par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
in the next scale we will add rights to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ ill@@ side slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not affect you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I have been working or people who know me for years , separ@@ ating myself - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; built up in their imagination .
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practic@@ ed our religion differently .
we identify with that Muslim to be a Muslim , but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective performance such as Muslims , which as I do not fit there , are mus@@ cul@@ ated .
Dis@@ crimin@@ ated Will Be Rel@@ ated
I do not get up alone .
that &apos;s even the poet , whose poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to one in the mind if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pastor and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western performance , religion had been deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the re@@ forming images of Muslims , which western books have been colon@@ ized since centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said disman@@ tled the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these photos still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to continue .
I &apos;ve worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , f@@ law@@ less s@@ aut@@ ori@@ ously domin@@ ate our news feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively overs@@ had@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the US couldn &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are ham@@ mer@@ ed to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both of both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exer@@ ts his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women , that lead movements to change .
it sees that the first Muslim Brotherhood had been spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans , that had been s@@ lan@@ ced with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively occupied our collective pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing force deeply and f@@ law@@ lessly , that often Si@@ kh @-@ Men and children are to become anti @-@ oxid@@ ant attacks and panic attacks .
because of these stories , that we tell , and because of the species in which we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just stories , based on facts .
or to altern@@ ate facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , which help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to record the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest degree in the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ isch@@ em@@ ic citizens .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation to come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my parents immig@@ rated to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewelry design in 5th Avenue , and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made of Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan was re@@ thinking about the lines of the world , my parents were untreated Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ fortun@@ ate Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or to carry out my hand hand@@ ker@@ enk@@ or@@ an , all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ p@@ utz &quot;
I am j@@ esting , we don &apos;t carry out all the pick@@ ets with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to combat widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bic arm@@ ory with pur@@ vey@@ ors , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell , and because of the kind in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bes is in more than just a stranger , who plu@@ ck up the head@@ scarf with a woman .

it addresses our identity that is so far reaching , so versatile and complex that it can fit in a drawer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim , but then I was born to my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe their religious life , they interv@@ ene to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ish ritual with my daughter , if I held her in my arms and her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran re@@ lie@@ ve the Koran and called the Qur &apos;@@ an .
each of them repeat three times .
I beg you , that it is protected from evil , the evil one that can see , and the evil one can &apos;t see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim Brotherhood is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , was pos@@ ing with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use are approved .
belonging is the image of my maternal grandmother with her sisters ; as they win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I look at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and one cor@@ on@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost vom@@ it off .
to be Muslim , to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only lord .
for a nation , which - over centuries - was founded by a &quot; Empire &quot; which a company established by the name v@@ ener@@ able British Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound sense to call my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use are approved .
belonging to us means to grow and hear that men do not weep , but at the same time see my added grandfather wept .
for@@ mid@@ ably , while he writes books on modern Islam and about independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan ab@@ vent@@ ured his family in India &apos;s ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as at my grandfather , have been torn apart from col@@ oni@@ alists , who have split the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim , that in the last two centuries Europeans will have &quot; colonial countries &quot; all up to four Muslim nations .
it means that the first air@@ men of the history was kicked off before a century on a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , a Indian , k@@ ins@@ ist subject to the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
even before he had airplanes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion , we go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ equ@@ alled history .
it means remin@@ ding that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction in Iraq , who did not exist .
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried below the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means that the su@@ ici@@ dal rate of veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that when a tragedy is insi@@ sted on the United States and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four @-@ ten years ago , the first prayer @-@ call , Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves .
it is knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad were ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this land .
it means Malcolm X call a American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .

the nar@@ rative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ess , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot;
a mother means to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ atures that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in transi@@ ent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in immigration , who takes five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that surro@@ unds its borders with people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and nebul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars which we lead and the bombs we cast on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and of those who are not told , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , researchers at North@@ western University participants showed a scientific picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 @-@ 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we have to lead
we are too deep into a Muslim , Muslim , or the other &quot; to enth@@ use the Muslim .
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ t@@ less and dangerous expression of expression we are in our news editorial actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to gras@@ p our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim badges ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , raising Muslim authors , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initi@@ atives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of the American life .
coll@@ age of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global time@@ out , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences exceeding the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that dis@@ the@@ or@@ ist the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown by making the &quot; other &quot; created .
a few years previously , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate major areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and history , which I wasn &apos;t aware of , as I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to a dis@@ missing Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread cro@@ oked track in my speech .
things that may wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that make our humanity , likes a story , where anyone is coming to another . &quot;
right now , at the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations took place in the context of the 8th Annual Conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics are talking about our problems with the &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American Milit@@ ar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools , or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here with this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward Said , the man who showed us how wars are led and people through the work of &quot; others &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago even Scienti@@ sts of Stan@@ ford was .
we ourselves have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of what my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we do not have a new future in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already bom@@ bed &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ rative art wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the licence CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an option here and now , despite a language barrier with someone related to someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported by Steven Bird &apos;s other initiative by Steven Bird , the in@@ eff@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS does not relate to the written word , but in the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain the speech vers@@ atility of large cities and worthy .
in fact , it is in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born children .
for the makers of the project , to :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents should not forget who they are to da@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often it is often connected to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear , to feel , to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent their story in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and its representation is to ensure that the audience would have to be established .
they call laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is related to the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou hun@@ ts the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of earth .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ able of h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ an in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he declares the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide grass , he shares his feeling of exclu@@ siv@@ ity :
they have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can get in contact with T@@ LS in order to arrange their own story @-@ counting tunes .
Puerto Rico demands from the USA Neu@@ en@@ forcement of the State Building
with the aim of a new inspection of public debt in Puerto Rico , which amount to $ 72 million in public debt , diverse religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started in the pu@@ er@@ ical Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
she was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizenship for the Neur@@ oration of D@@ ebt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ ish Church Council of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ jection of debt also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians , banks and government authorities , responsible for debts , are responsible for their corruption .
we demand a financial examination and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which is in favor of the economy .
we are squee@@ zing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay for debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not built in the United States of state - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization with a focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
on the out@@ set , measures are imposed without the participation and belief of citizens danger to be rejected by the people .
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the Syrian Palestinian web developer of Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , supporters and family advoc@@ ates the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he provided for an open net .

the book which was published last year and is explicitly available here , includes a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built , and what the real costs are associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers , who have involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on site to watch over the nebul@@ a , which surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feeds and to create something from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ le Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted by the Ad@@ ra prison directory , where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory portion of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and they want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of time @-@ wise over@@ beliefs ?
the web developer of Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra Pr@@ ison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police bases upon the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; of the military court in Ad@@ ra &apos;s cell .
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it had been contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who were self @-@ employed as the Insider of the Assad government and put them knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband .
his place to stay and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer in creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for around the public domain .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently super@@ se@@ ted by the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of P@@ asha &apos;s cultural prototypes were looking ahead as the work he started with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the trail of numerous civilian populations , and merge in Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS was all about doing this architecture that does not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and preser@@ vation has created a time capsule created to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ al@@ u@@ able importance .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life in order to dream of freedom and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med if I call his name .
Bas@@ sel made me English , even when he was already detained .
I have learned to read and write English good .
he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel open me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the Internet .
he also taught other imprisoned men as they explo@@ it computer , at least in theory , without knowing them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband , when he was detained in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book a year .
she ski@@ pped the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them into English from the Arabic .

here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it &apos;s happening with every visit ,
to sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment , in which we embrace us ,
whatever the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , bands and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison wheel of the prison
and I will answer you in every detail of your voice and words ;
which I bear with passion for my passion ,
if your eyes say Le@@ be@@ at
and I leave another piece of my soul ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
in order to recover all the moments ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I testify about myself , that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
one year goes , my soul
while , while
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage .
Bass@@ els History is not unique in Syria .
according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime , were tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we are repe@@ ating our demand today in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ k : due to corruption , the director after the release of corruption was resum@@ ed .
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt accident , with which a government member returned to the workplace at the state machine , where corruption was committed .
in this case , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Rat Cam@@ b@@ aza was between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of a good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ment to the company , which happened on April 19th , then .
in accordance with a position of the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic to refer the application , there was no obst@@ acle to reference to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to re@@ strain his old post , since the company did not do any disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants did not feel good .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and even a step back in regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that even the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the tra@@ ilers .
the company apparently , however , apparently and caused no reasonable legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour as well and considered the case as &quot; contradic@@ ted &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be counsel@@ ors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half consumed half .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has approved to be integrated into the company which he helped to inf@@ lic@@ t damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly be paid for his silence .
un@@ true !
bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director possessed no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State , because he did not believe him , I cannot believe someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already off@@ ended so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to serve and serve the state , * he had already serving a unique opportunity to serve the state , but himself has only served itself in the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was using the state as hand@@ ing to become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man , who was finally charged and eventually sentenced to a long term in prison .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Pr@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only remain as the first independent president in memory , but rather as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - by side by proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he doesn &apos;t turn from its ambi@@ tions .
an ambitious man is the same crime . &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also le@@ aning :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today the company places him with whom he mis@@ chief , again under contract . # Assi@@ m@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ acci@@ dentally . ( @ az@@ ure _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas or age @-@ aging .

according to information by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
even though the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin , or are generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely low con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as an hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ i usually like to be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself doesn &apos;t automatically call them in Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also poker hosts , in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about its use , were cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ous words with different mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ zer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was cleared today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they could , how he could reli@@ ve his back pain by making a wor@@ ding .
the ku ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ eller is the opinion that they will decrease radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic to spread rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the word .
the automation will not understand what you are writing on Fac@@ il@@ ook .
what it should do instead , be carefully analy@@ zing the mail and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age @-@ aged ) .
the good thing is that this dre@@ amy nation@@ alists , which hate speech language , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it &apos;s time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action likes to send a strong signal to all of them that hate speech language , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game , with the user to use social networks to use a new word or an alternative writing of cen@@ sored Word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was saying to me the li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the Post has not answered the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a wide range of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or who are simply trying to show their opinions to hate speech @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with Hass@@ elt :
mail without Hass@@ el@@ speech is removed from Facebook .
in the mail , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine thinks that Facebook has more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community would ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ ign intention of reducing rac@@ ism into Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
these words to c@@ ensor shall only bring more hatred inside the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support , and so words like &quot; stool &quot; or &quot; In@@ her@@ cur@@ ry &quot; prohibited .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ sely solved Po@@ sts .
if only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great revenue , it would be great .
fac@@ ebooks are automatic c@@ ens@@ orship for much reproach to users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now feel funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ elt , to see if their posts will be taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no Hass@@ elt , but still removed :

only to try if Facebook is the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have social networks have used to expand their votes and influence .
among other things , Hass@@ elt should also attack power in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been used for his failure to bring the out @-@ out Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ ial sites under control , critici@@ zed .
but instead of trying to c@@ ensor the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is to be ended with the child
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now illeg@@ ally .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament was unanimously approved a law which is to offer this practice therefore the age @-@ able age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members were held du@@ ci@@ istic and Muslim religious communities on the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group that would not inter@@ fere with representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the country , since that , the old age does not have the maturity . &quot;
this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN Child Labour Convention , the min@@ ors of children under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married 15 had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent , and 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s official statistics confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 .
online peti@@ tioning and social media movements that ende@@ av@@ oured to abol@@ ish laws to children before , followed at the foot , and rejo@@ iced with great support . no doubt they helped to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they ought to be dam@@ ned to care for their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition did not sort of tensions within this really complicated matter , and some point came by doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , so that it would be a simple majority to the law .
now only the president of the country must agree to the law and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle has once again posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft bill of the children &apos;s to@@ e was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices , and not one against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws before they were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ el Francis , who held a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary gri@@ ede , which does the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s right now is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that &apos;s worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely a long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the sacred age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on change of marriage was today , on June 9 , 2017 .
the House of Represent@@ atives has 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all members who were against , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s to@@ e is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ markt .
many thanks to all activists who have cast him out .
con@@ gr@@ ats .
thanks to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible hook is made in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
a few months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to be able to dissolve his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney , Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ co @-@ advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legi@@ tim@@ ely when Mahar@@ aj was against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject .
Patricia Vor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat if , instead of talking about the debate so generally , in a way that we invite to talk about the problem , that the state , our daughters may seem to be persu@@ aded that they may be ab@@ used against big , hard @-@ filled men who are compared to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a criminal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places around the world where the children &apos;s positions are legal or still the norm , even though there is laws that they sub@@ sist .

through the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , as opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA Copyright legislation in the USA , internationally di@@ vis@@ aged .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
since more than one month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day is more clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and fans and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many techni@@ qu@@ ered Internet users are used to use re@@ locking tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently published in a report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been portra@@ yed to find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , several mirrors are available ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
a solution was based on IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and makes complete c@@ ens@@ orship .
the content is posted , however , in spite of the illegal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( beyond the sources of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to disman@@ tle snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents based on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t get the www.@@ wi@@ ktion@@ ary@@ .org website .
IP@@ FS also contributed that this step is ir@@ respective of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid sperm .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ pe@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to ho@@ ve similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is closed on Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported sub @-@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , an Mir@@ ror .
it is access@@ ing a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the Server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ alese game photographer uses his camera to give attention to the need for nature protection
another rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .

use with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ ached moti@@ fs and balanced colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera with yourself and try to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ als , wants to bring to the international stage .
and his home location next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that give attention to Nep@@ als .
he described Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the rim of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what better is better for a passionate game photographers ! !
I just felt at home when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that the shore of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to take pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims a cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know it , because he had already standing tiger face toward face :
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of darkness in the way home when suddenly the king of Bu@@ on@@ ks appeared . he sits immediately , we look forward to and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar provides the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to capture at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of as@@ ps . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger , and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arri@@ vals .

years after the wedding of acqu@@ iring Indian women for the first time to acqu@@ iring the name of their husbands
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community @-@ organization from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , there are women with greatest care , to speak the name of their husbands or even by older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h , women give women to respect husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm to preserve these practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state O@@ get@@ a by an illu@@ sion@@ ed court and viol@@ ated her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives with name .
the tradition of their wives is also not common in their name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer positions to fear , if ever , they should not come in this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , there were nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the hos@@ tility of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
when one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ bath@@ al , operated by the community video volunte@@ ering and sett@@ ling for the disman@@ t@@ ling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the cover of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the end of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and conduc@@ ts this clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women , and at the same time they have made to ambassador inside the wall .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , did not mention their husbands in their name .
it has decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , so that women can easily identify themselves .
to acqu@@ iring the names of their husbands , is a ro@@ b that they all found guilty and have never asked in question .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes it a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered a prisoner , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted we have never thought about that discussion round about that discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never mentioned her husband before , had never felt at home at home , as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end .
practicing , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in our luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion star@@ ring .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
according to the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , lov@@ ingly and so on .
then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our husbands , but they could call us as they want us , means that they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never to speak the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the entire exercise , she only turned out and ch@@ oked . another decided to allow the whole acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression of their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
it was still in ad@@ renal@@ ine exchange to have broken with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they were actually trying to call their husbands at their name .
and they kept their word .
over the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put on the head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law urged them , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of participating in was less understand@@ ably and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ red point on its forehead , indicating the sp@@ est@@ status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped to carry him .
the other women never stopped doing so , but believe that they are now in a better position , even to carry him not to carry him in some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion club .
normally we packed lunch and water and go out to the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about those who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives and talked about things they had never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been insi@@ sted on some things like our identi@@ ties to our husbands , never talked to hon@@ estly .
it feels great to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have carried away only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ute @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt of a tro@@ users , wear it ; they did not get dar@@ nel .
after much argument and discussion on the advantages of its own wardrobe , mor@@ ality associated with Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ y Roh@@ ini their own pair of tur@@ ta ( upper hand ) in a discussion round so that women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since their first dis@@ discussion , Roh@@ ini has been confir@@ ming that things come slowly into the roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women rehear@@ sed them a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , myself included , are still doing it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
women at Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like a hur@@ ting to more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard @-@ navig@@ ating river .
by giving themselves each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club , each of us gives us confidence that will change something .
and I know there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when any woman walks in the club home and other people reported what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ trading , probably for super@@ sti@@ cally purposes , wor@@ ries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called for a number of operations into life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers away from border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the bodies were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there are the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a strong man of man can bear gold , or can give wealth , the police pre@@ ten@@ ers of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ aring men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the aims of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice in the South African country .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .

in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed to Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of the Blo@@ gger arm Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is faced :

despite the essence of phenomena , some had the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ort humor .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably recently made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of prison@@ ed Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver canc@@ ers at the end of June .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; on the basis of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affairs . &quot; he told it as &quot; not required to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless China will continue to release calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poets of Liu X@@ ia , release or to permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , other countries are wholly gone .
Hong Kong Free Press has put out some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
hands R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to permit Liu abroad .
Norway Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ ets have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway took part in the Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Liu , although the Norwegian government ha@@ sted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to return to China , because the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously injured , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Liu a to withdraw his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to withdraw his price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling to China , Liu and his wife immediately withdraw from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as they ha@@ sted in an explanation on 30 June :
we expect that China elev@@ ates all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him to help him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message on 27 June that the message to the Chinese authorities could not only release Liu , but also his wife Ms. X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the sum@@ mons from the US embassy attracted a ra@@ ging answer from China , with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel expenses and access to medical care of his choice , which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as the international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to ou@@ sting Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally released .
I demand China to release the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he knew himself in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government , Steffen Sei@@ bert , said that Liu explains all the medical support which he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , that China had major concerns about whether the vort@@ ex may be overs@@ ha@@ i@@ ded to Liu &apos;s visit in Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on Liu to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told him that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells more :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old his international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , and to exercise the rights of these rights .
France , France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , ir@@ respective where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news channel France has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the land , the Foreign Ministry announced that no further information is published if France would eventually get it up .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the Foreign Affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to meet Liu , and to show a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , revealed in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave him that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Liu :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and responsible for which he had contributed to a harmon@@ ious , stable and weal@@ thy China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt very well and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who stood for Charter 08 , who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or Country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at international level as an independent state .
but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam there should be Singapore as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of the State of New York , the Minister of New York noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
that &apos;s it , with most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Ministry of Justice , &quot; to twist logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , we would say that we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a flight to escape from the responsibilities , a priority .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons performed by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of what , he appeared continuously un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are led permanently from a party .
these cities are democra@@ tically .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old cor@@ pse comes back from the author@@ itative government , who pret@@ ended to be demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
relevant issues tar@@ ried with non @-@ answers rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ amal@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our recru@@ iting K Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point where it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by clicking on the blog , he points out on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire script of the conference , so that you could understand the context of the testimony of Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country .
read the inscription .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore were so uns@@ afe , even if we rejoice free and appropriate choices .
he has reached Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in that sense !
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am talking about what the minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what awaits me - was I understood with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ amal@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore I have doubts and I &apos;m not sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ assem@@ bles the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ amal@@ gam@@ bled a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as he plays an important role within the government of government , the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam are meaning@@ less importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , and do not defend their own city ?
who needs to pay our Prime Minister &apos;s Accounts ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was added to Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have upset many people of Singapur ...
nobody has said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island nation .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not true .
we should talk of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most vulnerable aspect to your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his dialogue partner by asking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , usually the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans can cook in anger when they are kept for Americans , but doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes between Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible to their ruck@@ sack when they are travelling .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
by contrast , Americans ... .
so it was , when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - by the world of Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always borne a small amount of map@@ le sheets to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons amongst us !
gay mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups than the toler@@ ant country .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we are Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it would not make me anything if you would change Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , as &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; to be &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ ear@@ ful - as well as the gut@@ tural , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one own Canadian double dar@@ ker ) .
if Canada really would be a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ers , that would indeed be a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; does not have a personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing where you can encounter .
harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one .
I would even be able to say that the desire to be free and only to be one of the Canadi@@ ans of Canadi@@ ans is .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what the outside world called &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just a cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence along the fence .
the warm hear@@ ted , open friendliness , which I now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video that seized power in 2014 and restore power in 2014 despite its promises to restore the civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about how to make his girlfriend .
although not politically , the music video refers to the continued military power of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for song was a huge success .
within the first three days the video uploaded on Facebook has been shared 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dictator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists trained to see this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as well as the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta dom@@ inion .
have a look at these shots of the video , which relate to some of the political themes involved in Thailand in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the provisional Constitution which is given to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army general decision making major national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; creation of creation &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to over@@ see online content and individuals who accused the monarchy to have s@@ lan@@ ders the monarchy , pro@@ secu@@ te pro@@ secuted persons .
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ward interview against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , Thailand was proclaimed the mar@@ tial law .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is need@@ less and a waste of control .
the video is even shown how persons are thrown onto a black delivery van , before it brings them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly insti@@ gated &quot; confusion &quot; in society and on Internet uses long term pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the Te@@ aser of the songs of the band , who used the Sal@@ ut , &quot; the Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which had already been used by put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 .

today , the largest part of Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called goat cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , after it had barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60 &apos;s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ sky , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s difficult to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why ?
it is nevertheless clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all of the community .
now there is only p@@ lowed road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , around fifty inhabitants live .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tsch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , one sees the balconies , where they will be dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girlfriend something and suddenly it deser@@ ted the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ Cuban arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to come across the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini &quot;
some ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Jung@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina didn &apos;t leave from Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to receive no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she , instead , supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to regularly meet and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everybody &apos;s busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
Nat@@ ascha , &quot; R@@ aun@@ t G@@ alya invo@@ ke her . &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes .
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for a period of time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remind of the village of the village .
despite the relatives who live in Central America , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke off ) they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administration building capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) recently .
we want to build a house there , but this will last something , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha is awarded for every child approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money .
her husband works in the mine .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tened situation , when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , they lost their fears .

&quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day , like the city and the war once were . &quot;
when our conversation is incl@@ ined , a little boy is over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
he plays with the ball , who put down the hill .
group children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they run , some of them cast stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , who will take care of their lives in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; M@@ om Africa &quot; hosts migrants in their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ ck was published on April 19 , 2017 at the site of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears here with friendly permission .
cross the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Bra@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican female , a small woman carrying a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Bra@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars a night sleeping the guests in easy rooms , with grinding , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in one cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the top part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez had already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
they don &apos;t want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and bring them to the hospital , if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that drew out of the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa had a reasonable peak name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yoghurt ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal for a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard of other people accompanied by Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he rel@@ ates that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ kaner often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans speak on What@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells the SIM card to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; mom Africa is our Mother , and we never let it go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds to smile . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that their guests have often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chicken to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very popular here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city a S@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family have taken refuge in their little house .
it is Poli@@ z@@ ist and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold to expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment , there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the ceiling on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled after a raid on his workplace from the United States .
the majority of migrants , traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an omni@@ present , has offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the gears , the trav@@ ellers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , much of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grand@@ ma , she ig@@ nit@@ es her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair care that you have made a client , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , kids and old people .
she laugh@@ ed sad , while she briefly introduces her .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; re@@ iter@@ ates it every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users . keep it out .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minority region in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a cell phone call , in which it shows the district government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had replaced messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the Noti@@ fication of the Police , the App meets the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , by online fraud , Trojan and ph@@ ishing sites to give users attention how much time they spend online and to control the own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can , of course , be used in various ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ acker can be able to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person or from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while announ@@ c@@ ements are about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , afflicted ethnic minority interests such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme temperatures and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ulated Internet .
based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( a try @-@ out ) , the cen@@ sored news published in China showed photographs from a check@@ point where police officers had randomly checked the residents , whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people install the app within 10 days .
if you are using a check@@ point using a unit without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
they have forced the people to use equipment that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by adding resource technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China again .
&quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Separ@@ ating them out . ) and also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which emerg@@ es that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , allowing full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell@@ phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the orders of the city council , to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions from the cy@@ ber security office on the operation of their computer and communication equipment .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external disks , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards . &quot;
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of different reference price , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
one individual cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and make sure you &apos;re all alone in one place in which all is important .
everything has broken down and dis@@ b@@ anded and being revealed to a truth , which is clearly identi@@ fiable , both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that puts down in a list of feelings and expressions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors to allow .
but if you pick up the reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and perform@@ ers - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt solve themselves in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth remains on the axis of the inno@@ cence . you will realise that you are caught between the walls that builds your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , Stein um Stein .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so I mean &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the head of security services form@@ ulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he presented his power over us , by destroying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew .
five young@@ sters were torn in a peaceful protests like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cover the town the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the bor@@ hoods were desi@@ rable , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not have high demands to a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ called security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply of the neighborhood stopped working .
I pier@@ ced the silence by crying several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice rec@@ alled by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we came to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations .
at such a moment , you are aware that you delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s just not interested in the straight line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you ready , we meet at the military safety office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have taken her way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I was now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes @-@ filled eyes were upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dream of what to look to me in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
maybe it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure when I replied , &quot; I would have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never stopped to look to you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment , which could have fatal consequences for me , and yet I have no word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal with it . &quot;
the ank of this cursed movement is located to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; an alleged torture that was abandoned for months .
I scre@@ aming the farm .
at the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
thereafter again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the single cells .
I pre@@ paid all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise , they probably shared a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials abandoned the cell , and I handle an old @-@ tried communication method : with the fist hit the wall .
I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; ex@@ iting prisoner . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me .
apparently in none of the nearby cells there was a respected man @-@ aged man who sees Me and &quot; the doctor called . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there is no markings to recognize , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers are connected with its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would leave him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams will shine , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the color of corruption is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the horror into person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ ch@@ ung to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to hear . &quot;
that was a mystery : to protect the State security in front of us and prevent the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect , and thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational replacement card and ver@@ ri@@ fied the close vision of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is not a country here ; it is a curse which they call Ko@@ exist@@ ance to turn the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I look into the hearing room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least it comes to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions out of him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this ta@@ ver@@ side and protest on demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer , not to answer .
I can really say that , when ins@@ ults and s@@ lows after a friendly communication have become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how did it happen was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to acc@@ use myself or bad , although I had done nothing to make this punishment .
to rebu@@ ke in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker takes you to your scre@@ am .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , why they cast the tube through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked once as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal job equipment .
they had used four cables in each other to present us from their point of view , great invention of a giant Cab@@ al .
within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the series .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which I heard scre@@ aming .
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling , and found no pleasure at all , which is why he pressed the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity pier@@ ced my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ bodied body , stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the pain disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me as minutes .
then call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ ck &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an in@@ exhaus@@ tive youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must make terrible wor@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !

Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sm@@ iles on his screen , sometimes on his computer , and back to his couch again .
what you can leave , is a cigarette between his fingers , or his nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ spotted lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which heard them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ y@@ een ( about : farmer ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who was transferred to the conservative Maj@@ ority and their well @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ists .
with its music , which often concerns itself with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only found in his home town of Amman , but also in cities that from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of San@@ aa .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is regarded as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and it can help people with the people that suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if it doesn &apos;t open it , it swe@@ eps against US foreign policy a special dis@@ likes .

H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , something with its identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee of second generation &quot; - so he signi@@ fies himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is empha@@ sized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a person , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he is a person sol@@ dered nest café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunrise up to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has some weakness for breaking through ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has a little bit of coffee at a sen@@ tim@@ ed jun@@ it@@ ag little with protest against Islam .
generally speaking of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily freedom of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when you throw a look at the neighbouring countries .
thus , it simply avo@@ ids it easy to do fundamental things - as in public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry had cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila , already for the second time .
several members of Parliament that support the Islamic Republic - argued that the Muslim orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front @-@ tra@@ der Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contra@@ di@@ ct the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and is the main reason for the concert table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Islamic coalition of Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been canc@@ eled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , Human Rights and Free Speech in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses an ancient legi@@ timacy author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which still decided to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be the rhet@@ oric of the rhet@@ oric , but actually a clear@@ er @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ ative reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b made traditional gender nor@@ ms to body , formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had the pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently down@@ lighted unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they actually trust .
over the past years , the number of &apos; honour@@ able &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch suggested that , in 2016 , the number of honour@@ able species reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still lacking to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate manner .
according to a law on the frag@@ ile control of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , &quot; and for their release often a long bureaucra@@ tic effort , as well as the guarantee on the family &apos;s guarantee is necessary for nothing to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for it , not to re@@ locate the themes in his country as tab@@ u .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , that he is his music , which is full of explic@@ it att@@ achments to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , does not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was du@@ bbed politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; there is a focus on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , will continue .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
during the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a sort of market in which you can get what you want , &quot; it is faith or faith , het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there were hardly anyone who speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were greatly cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were taken out of the context , twi@@ sted and addressed his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b tou@@ ts the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance on homosexu@@ ality is not spoken against Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ anything , a eighth century poet , who still has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is wonder@@ ing : if Abu Nu@@ anything , who later should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , did not have anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled to do .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Agency held several former government officials and members of the teachers , with the reason that they had expressed concerns on comments in social media , related to the deeply ro@@ oted corruption in the country .
in the face of this is the concert of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ anians .
for him , progress has been inten@@ tional and taking . Jordan has denied a performance for the second time , but the road of progress - such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ battles and intern@@ alised changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
at the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , as millions of other Arabs also , out of an Arab world without Inter@@ ventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ amt not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to live &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is concerned using music , art and literature from a real and basic op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ aks and artificial type @-@ headed democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it happens , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ emble and therefore resist resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which A@@ man is a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories to the origin of the Neb@@ ula festival .
it is thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the drums , the drums and dancing over a thousand years ago have come from the West Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force in its knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , therefore we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I &apos;ve been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival , the only True - and still a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched my # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high tower car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of summer !

rare were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the spar@@ ks .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road noise and illegal drug traff@@ icking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , the appearance , and therefore the unusual hair@@ styles by famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to give you more nor@@ ve@@ ers into the experienced hands of hairdres@@ sers , which can re@@ produce this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts can compete against each other to show who can create the ex@@ cent@@ ric circles of them , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of bad advice to get a training in hairdres@@ ser &apos;s art , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a profession , currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we built this education community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the working version of the Beit@@ er &quot; Liebes@@ gements , guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
is it not much more import@@ antly , people who are out@@ stretched out , give aff@@ ection ?
just this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga von der Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired her to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , young people encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
just recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ le movement of F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signat@@ ory of the Nobel Peace Treaty was so important that the president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its mer@@ its .
however , before colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ers there is still a long way until one can talk about a real reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ atro@@ opers , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried around the clock their weapons with themselves , must now integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which was acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear , and in some cases , have to absorb deep hatred against guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , this now has to support them in their ranks and support them in construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian had to close together and would have to help the integration process .
and precisely that they did : by now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them again in the society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters - which should be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Recon@@ ciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak to Mount Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this declared that we love the people who love to letters to the Valentine &apos;s Day on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need it much more necessary .
he plane , he told us to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent customer .
so , the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2,000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would be forgiven &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19 .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ enes site to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC on how they had done earlier in order to counter@@ act the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive commands but letters full of sub@@ missions from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings could go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; says the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor del Cau@@ ca province , described this unforgettable experience :
after having passed the letters , a former fighter made me of the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of tabernacle , in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla who wrote something .
I was afraid to enter , because beside him on bed there was a M@@ GL shooter , a le@@ thal weapon in the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life , someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly , my tears went over the che@@ eks .
I strongly embra@@ ced him , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life as a war . he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine . &quot; I would have never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a company outside there , who is waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons .
but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
for the first time , students and a leader of the F@@ ARC went to a discussion round .
the students had grown up as well as war and the F@@ ARC had already seen in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social in@@ justice revol@@ ved on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society just in this country .
for a target of this order , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who haven &apos;t had heard yet before and had no voting rights , and to recognise that the people I often have seen as a monster , and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , where the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - also those who have killed and so much harm have caused us to contribute to a smile and a hug and a hug .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Je@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colombia se@@ eded that peace would reign according to dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and protest to their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution , and bring sacrifice , because we know of own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend the life as the foundation of existence , will be imp@@ ending many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ash value over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends , did not come on overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international headlines several months ago , after reports were published , causing the tow@@ ing , torture and killing men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , who took to susp@@ ecting que@@ ere men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there .
from her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they were grown up , her aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after having experienced a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya on her family wife , the hunt was opened at Sabrina .
she moved out of fear for her life last end to the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I was trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them no more to Ch@@ echn@@ ya that you can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the What@@ s@@ App go round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard another set , but this time in Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you still honour the family , you shame ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wa@@ xed last end to the hospital .
apparently , some women had received everything and scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two ten@@ ants in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which nurse were you laid - in whom the men or the women ?
Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats of threats last February .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mar@@ g@@ gling .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked absurd requirements : some told me , I have to prove it by going up by the streets ; others wanted me to rise in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have bas@@ kets size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family go to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said my m@@ um on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , not just your family , but the whole republic has hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you need to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she made herself a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved in an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number sign with a 95 .
after the third time happened , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember all of them , they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable .
I can still do not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
came up and checked the hotel .
the number was registered to a foreig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment , when I wanted to call my mother per What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be in safety , just because you have left the country ?
people already know , in which hotel you are on . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still wear in myself .
so much I wish I would not overcome this se@@ al@@ an barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to watch the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the present situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are gone ?
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed more information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had eaten one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had not been arrested and tortured , yet all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he didn &apos;t lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end , require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men in this secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it just wouldn &apos;t be very many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relations or that have been dropped by their relatives to place the Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present themselves as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but di@@ pped to radic@@ alizing themselves .
OC Media : is this only a su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in Ar@@ gun in a half months .
he says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was involved himself when these people were taken along .
until now they were not introduced as a ban@@ dits , there were no reports yet . however , we believe that such actions are quite possible .
why else could it not be allowed to shave off ?
do you know , whether these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings belong to people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already in 2003 I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately cast us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were kno@@ cked ; I had colored eyelashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every night , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches were standing , and all the city knew it . they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen &quot; language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t mo@@ ck about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they are making fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off before you , because they thought you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this Gn@@ ome Time held ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking about mor@@ als in television .
he did not say about us , but primarily on the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change .
who had v@@ owed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
during the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you go after ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as a activist .
at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communic@@ ating with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ els , together , I am guiding them to the hospital , helping them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t miss a cent for this .
I discovered these people myself , when I cut off places .
I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ ot .
so nature , that has absolutely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who wanted to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bul@@ ls at them .
the Da@@ gest@@ s have those who have the Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er who have those who have Russians also who , on all the planet , are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is annoying to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims walking into the mosque and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think of identity card to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a dec@@ ay .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise , different habitats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know I &apos;m myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ ral community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab ancest@@ ral community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child . he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness prev@@ ailing to return in@@ ability to his family , such as ancest@@ ral human rights groups , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which has occurred in August within the Arab ancest@@ ral minority , and activists war@@ n from the spot that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ us , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ ar .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family events that felt free because of persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and to work safe work .
Arab ancest@@ ral azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which most of the Arab communities living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took over power and in 1925 to complete the efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas areas in Iran , as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , regional economy continued to develop only slowly , and the native population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and ab@@ norm@@ alities .
the Iranian regime denied its involvement in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of con@@ strains , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to destroying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness causing destruction , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fishing and palm @-@ pal@@ ms .
the unemployment rate among Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ adolescents now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who have completed a job , finished primary school , finished 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % have university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national contradic@@ tions &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activist with London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young ancest@@ ry men .
in particular , Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment had become more worse . this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since function and institutions don &apos;t pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Jama@@ hi@@ azi will disp@@ oss@@ essed access to work@@ facilities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , to destroy and destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the ancest@@ or , since even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or the Tra@@ ction of Arabic clothes are not toler@@ ated .
in view of the circumstances caused by the Arab Jama@@ hi@@ azi , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , if the world wake up and know@@ led@@ geable about it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women , especially white women , signi@@ fy themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you are wonder@@ ing why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even well thought well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all Fem@@ inist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women sooner or later in diverse areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and familiar .
I am convinced and I am twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I consider what kind of femin@@ ist movement has been used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists were silent .
but nevertheless they all agree that women - all women should come together to lift their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve the equality ( some of the women &apos;s equality ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence an institutional form against racial violence , which we have exposed black women to double @-@ fold ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties and country of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all human beings are not any skin colour of the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot take myself as black woman to take into account of the white woman who ref@@ uses to take care of the sex as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am tired and I &apos;m not going to fight any more about my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ ist sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a wife ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology during which the black woman is a de@@ fied and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to include group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to drive their eg@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not attempt to draw white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to dis@@ close the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to render women of different origin and limits himself from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to resolve myself full and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me of the Wom@@ an@@ ism which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ful that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever , that we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : as we can rec@@ ap@@ point ourselves , in which they can define ourselves on our own way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed to the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately retri@@ eved , after reading these lines , I ple@@ ad to inform you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic area , I can lift the women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I become recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

Maikel Nabil Mus@@ a went back over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to deliberately keep the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a that explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effects of contamination on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost as I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country feared that the decades of war , the construction of dust strains , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation of the Water@@ tender Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ press Alliance - which is involved and working on how to protect the rivers , streams , and water routes in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;

ass@@ ays Women and their Diff@@ ic@@ ult Stru@@ ggle against Viol@@ ence

the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ sk . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Hol@@ der ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said that A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said it was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent .
since the end of its relationship there was a bit of time and the police said that their statement would not be laid down , but more could you do .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the ac@@ us@@ kun@@ k ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not benefit .
a few days later , the second wife moved their ad .
to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women want to adver@@ tise at all , they generally don &apos;t get support from the State .
in many cases , women also depend on men , which they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law en@@ forcement agencies .
behavi@@ our@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that is not inferior to un@@ ni@@ pp@@ ment 3 : good approach , f@@ law@@ ed realization and st@@ ats
it is difficult to see how many women really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports which are not even accumulated , the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of 9@@ 600 adver@@ ts due to domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women .
86 % of ads found in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peac@@ ekeeping force . 86 % of the ads added here .
in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women that they were physically abuse , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics show , however , not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of those off@@ ences are actually shown . &quot; on any woman , who are ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psych@@ otic mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , there are 9 women that do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman that has been ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no independent crime , the law en@@ forcement agencies cannot be appropri@@ ately documented how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , repor@@ ters included a minimum of 12 cases of women in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay was at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence through men .

invisible ab@@ uses and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has been the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , after all . this should never regret it for ever .
today , Mariana has 28 years old and has no longer been with Carlos . but for two years she has led the psych@@ ic violence towards women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most wei@@ ght@@ ful appearance :
I have never thought that myself would be victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are mis@@ fortun@@ ate because they are mis@@ leading to violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered to their posts , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
the other Facebook users asked Mariana so why they had dropped out of Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least had a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who was not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had har@@ assed them .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities were not a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ mistak@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and its home country in which it went mainly for money , power , and influence of their former partner .
customs legislation : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not being applied .
the display of ab@@ uses is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed under the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # princip@@ alities ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law is to explain and pun@@ ish femin@@ ism into an independent off@@ ender and pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
so the leg@@ islat@@ ure has changed in some points to win also the members of the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be sentenced to five years in jail .
the original law plan provided , most of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process cost , which must carry out the victims of violence itself , if they simply wish to restore and secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the leg@@ islat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial means for this purpose :
in Paraguay mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking is to take place , violence is no longer considered anything .
those who keep silent in the face of these facts , bears witness , and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are gone .
we must re@@ im@@ bur@@ se so long , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . however , parts of the Law were changed . amongst others , a passage has been canc@@ eled that the partners were calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is considered a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent Media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been locked because of a decision of the information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the Austrian authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be imprisoned in jail where he served a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , were also arrested and transferred to trial again later .
Oman has been gover@@ ned by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power after having lost his father , Sa@@ ï@@ i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur by a coup .
since then , along with his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sul@@ t@@ ans is characterised by the serious efforts of security forces , especially national freedom , including press freedom , clos@@ ets and human rights def@@ ending , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the authorities compl@@ ains in respect of peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights activists , activists , in mind to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the custody three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported in Oman by corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) since its foundation in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , concluded an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . in this regard , corruption was forced in the Judi@@ ci@@ ary and the intervention of senior officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused persons under pressure to aband@@ on the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Edition Az@@ am@@ n published July 26 , 2016 with a report on the cover page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Z@@ ah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a member of the editorial board , was charged by the ISS and was arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS appointed Deputy Chief Editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed for und@@ eter@@ min@@ ed time after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on every way , including online from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ cat took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri .
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were convicted of &quot; abuse of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a public domain and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison pen@@ alties and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of £ 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information grid to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
on 22 August 2016 , al @-@ Ab@@ ri was granted a b@@ ail of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
al @-@ Ha@@ j announced the Appe@@ als Court on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison on 26 December 2016 .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in a prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he served his incar@@ nation .
the Court of Appe@@ al also took up the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself exposed by the om@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further instruction in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister of Appe@@ al issued a further time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al , the publication of the newspaper again .
the constant shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases , in which in Oman , recent times the press freedom was hurt .
for example , the closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin , and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , include the first independent online newspaper in the country to en@@ roll their operations .
due to the lasting closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the relevant violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists may follow their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . under any circumstances , in Oman , human rights activists and journalists are un@@ hin@@ dered in Oman their righ@@ t@@ ful human rights work and without fear of understanding , including geri@@ atric sl@@ ur@@ ry .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights of human rights ( including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , ai@@ ded and provides protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing range , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for on @-@ site medical research , there are two reasons : for instance , in the supply of the global healthcare industry , there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical requirements on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects as elsewhere , and lack of investments in the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists will be carried out in building their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can be only instrumental in the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the epidemic of AIDS showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself insi@@ sted on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ pled health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about these research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I will support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just star@@ ved a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant diseases .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recipi@@ ents instead of being mo@@ vers .
the solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : out of the USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw near here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it lasts months to import it from other countries .
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , beginning at every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , the health care system ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the harder access to scientific expertise , which are present here .
the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the USA to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seeds that change global food production .
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on already bre@@ wed in the United States since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astr@@ on@@ aut in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work has been reduced by its own in@@ solven@@ cy and question as many all@@ ot@@ ments can be given to borders .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he realized that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
the patents have not only been used for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ru@@ ined leaves .
over the past years , more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereals or cardboard sites . because of this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and expert knowledge ensure food safety around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still seeks salad , however , because his work is still much more difficult for his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a rock rock &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a river that I must p@@ add@@ ling with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go to salads too far .
and when they stand before the court , no one can breed any more new sal@@ ts because all features are already patented . &quot; he makes it so good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
it is also connected to a movement that is growing in the United States and everywhere in the world : open source re@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
astr@@ onau@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS drew red ro@@ mat@@ y of the variety Out@@ red@@ der in the greenhouse building &quot; of the station so@@ ared and eaten . it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds so sound like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source , &quot; which offers alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and are not as intellectual property protected and so are us@@ eless for plant bre@@ eders .
under the initiative of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eders is able to under@@ take that others can use some cultivated seeds freely .
this does not mean that they do not continue to continue doing business with their seed . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders also allow others to breed their seeds , to breeding such own varieties , and it is not immediately exp@@ elled - two aspects , which are banned or prescribed by many plants .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security as well as for environmental protection .
seeds : according to him , a role in larger cl@@ ings such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter or only little to breed seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , we need to buy control of seeds in the global agricultural industry , whose most recent examples have been announced in August and September 2016 . &quot; who is good , locally and sustainable produced vegetables , as it is offered to farmers markets , should also know the way that this vegetable is cultivated , is threatened .
dietary superior without seeds without seeds is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to contributing other its seeds still freely . in contrast , you are contrary to patent seed and plant attributes .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gen@@ pool due to the always abundant spiritual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted , un@@ ce@@ asing .
Claire Lu@@ by , the director of the O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her thesis with genetically modified variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ es are protected as intellectual property , which makes it useful for plant bre@@ eders either at all or not worthy .
for other plants , there are not such estimates but experts such as Lu@@ by suggests that massage @-@ based plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or car@@ rot .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are so far@@ med that they have targeted description - of such , through which their taste or their color improves up to such , due to those in certain environments thri@@ ve and threats of p@@ ests or diseases .
ad@@ versaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is increasing by more than ever more patents . however , genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions are caused by climate change much worse .
in an e @-@ mail explains Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for monopol@@ y activities . with a total of four genius and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company set itself the conservation of the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property has other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant styles innovations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is basically a plan which everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result .
such protection does not inhi@@ bits innovations , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees another : 20 years for waiting until a patent is changing , they certainly don &apos;t wear innovations .
and if you have to wait so long for plants to breed crops , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mort@@ on , however , is that genetic resources always had been a general public and it should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary inc@@ en@@ tives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
this is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible to make us know if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of making plant features : &quot; we are not creating the characteristics .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state , Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; he who cultiv@@ ate a variety , are also breeding his own values in them .
those who believe on industrial agriculture with major farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for cultivation of produce in her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , who cultiv@@ ate in his varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such which move on international markets ) , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents have , there are most smaller seeds companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject this pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on is also the opinion that bre@@ eder is innovative thanks to avo@@ idance of plant patents innovative : &quot; it looks like being able to produce new ideas , stronger than companies that patented .
I need to constantly meet new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years even , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected 20 years before the competition , with what makes it easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , however , the concept spreads quickly around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , works the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ e is working on an open source , which ultimately became a form@@ alistic and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from land to land , of which the O@@ ss@@ i commitment not simply cannot be taken one into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conventional plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is part of the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ ed systems in Ethiopia , based on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards developing seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &quot; Programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; Se@@ ed systems , states that the organization is currently launched a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be scheduled to fall on the official start of next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development assistance ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , represents a report that farmers have the opportunity to communicate to seeds , to communicate it and be ensured a stable supply with food products .
in this report the importance of a diverse , local supply is empha@@ sized with seeds for sustainable food systems - an context that by the Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Movement for Regional and Ec@@ ological Food mainly respected , and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to clari@@ fy the people even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which document human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above that .
the network released a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region .
the General Network for Human Rights Information remains bt@@ b - despite this attack and deri@@ vation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution through the authorities that are actually def@@ ending their target to overcome the expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities have been de@@ pl@@ eted in order to overcome the blocking , and not to admit our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1st human rights organisation of the wave of web sides for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ nist and Human Rights Research Minister Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles , which he writes in Egypt un@@ accessible websites and media .
now , the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the customs apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , that is home to the distributor of Zi@@ adas blog , however , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 when he talked about the student protests and took a video how the police practic@@ ed physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly involved in politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him :
to lock the blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it &apos;s for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is well done to give me the feeling of a siege to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , Charge of the National Security Council , the blocking blogs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an impact , even if only a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mud go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian officials announced on May 24 till 06 . August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ enne .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , by removing internet search and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 we realized how the web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s have started .
such a practice refers to the government &apos;s intention to block content , and filter content to access the Egyptian users .
the situation , in addition , is conce@@ aled that the decisions are made behind closed doors , so the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction , using them to proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government prepared by c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

daily brief@@ ing newspapers from Rio de Janeiro , the second biggest city of the country and home of several postcard illustrations .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; Each Day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves &apos;s pharmacy with military arms , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Wash@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an emerging financial situation , the highest level of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO , the Brazilian NGO , called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio conf@@ essed newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16 August the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is not normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision , the newspaper explained like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual sav@@ or , etc . everything , however , will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so we did not close our eyes to the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes said the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper expl@@ aining that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 territories , that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper further writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is distor@@ ted , also may be used , congratulations to the police who only sho@@ ots and then asking questions to conce@@ de .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than they share ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued to design@@ ate violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this was more difficult for a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to move to the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investments in personnel , education , and historic and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of the public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non@@ violent cities in Brazil are located according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no such cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we watch the murder rates per federal state , Rio lies on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
it is specially one of the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has been empha@@ sized that since years the policy of security has been repeated .
to this security policy measures , the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of the police unit to capture a F@@ av@@ ela police unit and to capture a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this led to a decrease in non@@ violent deaths . however , after several years the U@@ PP was supposed to protect against ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities who had to protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under fire .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux set out from one of his article in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not refer to the - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio also draws serious consequences for human beings .
for this calls for the state to use resources and ways , which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion in the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ alized damages &quot; and &quot; ver@@ aging spher@@ es . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas are still suffering in Rio .
one week it is now that the police ret@@ ali@@ ate the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ ail the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made headlines : a st@@ res@@ eller died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 , and in the subsequent war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the UN peac@@ ekeeping organization PA@@ X and the research institute , The Syria Institute , in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b , are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons demanded the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations , and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other Human Rights organisations , that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebels have stood under siege under siege under siege under siege , which led to the inhabitants of the locally owned or tunnel @-@ related food , controlled by tunnel and control points .
by the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
in response , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they themselves call themselves G@@ hou@@ as Al@@ en@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .

because of fuel short@@ ages , locally produced fuel from plastics used to supply the energy generators .
Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of the fung@@ al &quot; from the regions , before they checked their quality and whether they are not suitable for consumption .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 Br@@ ings
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and called justice for the victims of the fires that ra@@ ced in the week before , in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks bur@@ sts that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy happened , where the fires accounted for 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system that is monitored by satellite photos , in 2017 alone , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the great@@ ness of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some from Twitter users divided images :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread themselves in the web and show images that allow better insights into the creatures :
the fore@@ se@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection had not been able to susp@@ end the level of tragedy as far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al stated by the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages have been ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy happened again as in June , because the streets were very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits are covered in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ lements with a high risk of fire .
an extensive proposal on the forest form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ able by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government conducted a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had a means for self protection - that was an open door , that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João Sor@@ val continued in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , itself , like in a v@@ icious circle , continues to spread the fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal is on October 15th and 16th , when citizens sought information or tried to contact persons who was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October , the servers that followed the fires that followed the fires , were unable to reverse the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a fear@@ less civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . in this way , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair .
just at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan during the last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother never said it then , she knew her son would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick it up and bring him to the flo@@ ats .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt protection .
the Taliban were always closer to support for their hatred against the Haz@@ ara well known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a co@@ h@@ edge . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left by his low wage , and went into Iran . once again , he once found himself in a strange country with other refugees and tow@@ ed s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than himself to make his living .
at that time like today , the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were co@@ ined by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af compl@@ ained in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so we do not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous journey on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application in 2002 , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af left homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice the day food to needy .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high wat@@ ering quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers are found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Human Rights organisation of the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system has been suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the great majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in more than 3000 &quot; special exhibition centres . &quot; there is an impro@@ mpt@@ u facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission center , when they officially put an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum application for months .
till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the streets .
so there is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his diso@@ bedient li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood helped A@@ shar@@ af to release himself soon from these conditions .
after having made various work in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af put his total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a sn@@ ail .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucra@@ cy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afghanistan created businesses , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants even praised the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of the Orient Experience in which the cellar and the kitchen staff had mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu is nar@@ rated by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish , and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened at the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to reach far beyond the Italian restaurants and retail , and aim to retreat into the country that he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forgot my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily when I know my people suffers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must have the same options as all others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where humans can produce packaging and preser@@ vative techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stand stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . well , he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
