<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My dear to America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American films, American authors have been reading and operated with American authors.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this land had a profound impact on me that I was mainly a journalist for the American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year-old I saw the Grand Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Stuff, the Supreme Court of Justice of a Oil-Magnum, who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free after Method Man," "" "I was it as if this is the absolute Truth, everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming, that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find in a community of equal people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very shy love letter writing about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me as it goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain, as it was so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people responded to his testimony and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with Republican Presidential elections, the highest number formed by the party became the nominal candidate ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not make Trump and his electorate in line with people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, people from all over the world, a deeply believer, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Truman hasn't agreed with the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer, "the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhaga and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours in order to watch the Phoenix Suns' at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced for Sandy Bahr, who fights for life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my family of hosts, who actually treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits with the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to accustom us to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice has helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">Those people, who embodied values, deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump went up his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counter to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either divided his racism and fanatismus because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the trump voters as raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and suggests an inability to understand those who take care of a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them know, have voted for trump, because they want to regain control over a country that disappoints her?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt to those who looks different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (m.).: as much as "rejection of the White against all other ethnicities;" pun from white to the White and Whiplash, what a great Van Jones called it, has just killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background can you always have, America is welcome every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country, as his presidents, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would be possible nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas of this promise and says: to hell with versatility, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the rudder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, is my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd collapses.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "someone who isn't like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not that of America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Truman Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no more space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments," by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaean city Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played in both places does not only change the life of children, but also has a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the outskirts of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musical Academy) has been playing in the community: one out of children and adults of existing Symphonie Orchestra, which with their musical instruments an opportunity for overcoming their poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A musical school with 100 students has become the central interest for the parish of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The church, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs fire.</seg>
<seg id="77">However, this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, which started a musical project and offered the youth as a rare hopefoot.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the gubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the highest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital, which is produced from recovered waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments, made from local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitated slusts, violins, celli, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all manufactured from waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times Favio ChÃ¡vez reminds himself a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura to the starting time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse, and we did not know about the same place where the parents did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown somewhat, which he never had seen before: a violin was made out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and that the Recycled Orchestra is playing.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landscape Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">LandCaHarmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational drama of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">This East African countries show how technology and team work can fight the illegal fishing industry</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild fishing industry is struggling.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine published specifically for international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication is in the context of an agreement with Global Voices for shared content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and much inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles have rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to share it a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the Premier was surrounded by countries that just refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries agency. he is part of a team that discovered the ship once and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the region's waters: it did not succeed there to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">At the end, however, it was forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegal fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar, who had driven the prime minister of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries to work together and work together. they exchange information and stand each other in where there is illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track. the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the chemical balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled once through bureaucratic hurdles, with the information between individual countries, the actions occurred nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to identify ships, which are fishing in banned areas - such as suspicious rides - such as those that indicate that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fish licence, where they were on the way and maybe even if they have a firendent.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing permits can then refuse to provide the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there's significant financial losses for the owners, which means that the illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And this is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a berlain company who is involved in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa, and FISH has also supported.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already known platform was created to win over 20 million USD of lost revenues, who lose eight members of the HISH 2015 network each year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industry, attracting the area of commercial fishing trips around the world. these were also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices among other things include campaigns such as the sailing under false flag, fake license documents, specifying imagination, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make itself the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system," "" "says Long." "" "once, a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say 'You mustn't walk my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and precisely this legal conclusion tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">FISH has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships since its inception.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had distributed licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships who used several fraudulent identification and found it to be persecuted and found floating vessels.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crimes, FISH may share information on illegal fishing across huge distances and received.</seg>
<seg id="129">Some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help the FISH should be suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to accumulate the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, who also offers technical support with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automated identification systems, wherewith they can no longer be ortable of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to help discriminating ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the marine conservation organization Oceana. a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed on the position of each traceable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "accumulate with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this will simply make sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to combine to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system permits tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only find criminals but they do deter them as well.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which were used to override a license before, and hardly expected to count with consequences, now know that they are being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH has now sold a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors located there on board in towernets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries notice these achievements. "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are going to disappear yearly several hundred million dollars annually through illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together with the so-called West Africa Task Force, and now they are fighting the illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH. "With security, the aim is to make more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia announced its first major triumph: in October, it was in Greko 1, a ship that was travelling under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and they were already forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also prohibited in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with the Take of Measurement Against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed towards illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work mode of the oceans actually works throughout the world's oceans.

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeadVenezuela (approximately: the return of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also run in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located in the central country Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which is noticeable in everyday life of the Venetians by a acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the official president NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in their latest articles in the context of the government's context:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation rate is estimated at 500% (the inflation rate is estimated at 500%) and in which a serious and far reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum for many as the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to a new governance.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was released on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano said now in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, were examined for crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not been looking for his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, such names as his father bear to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation, I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magenta.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at 15, you don't notice that it is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was not able to recognize that my father was a thief, folklist and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">He had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarerieofficial. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, his father was a deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the narrocker which was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in nearly 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixjanos son, a man who had experienced the magnitude of atrocities that he had seen as young, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child, and how this child has chosen a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went into the sports hall. I had married myself with a boy, martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and several days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me on to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>

<seg id="230">My father gave me a total of four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible - stood there.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small piece wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big clumsy silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other hand of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">So the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a song, being tortured in man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a dirt-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they set the end of a cable. the other end has been attached to the body of the person who was running there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They fed a people with handcuffs on the bed, shot him with water and drove him a load of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of deduction.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came, that they should be laid.</seg>

<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, chief of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>

<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a complicity in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay a burden to me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="299">I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">You could have been able to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill those people. but to make their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Had these people not even families, to whom one could be given their mortal remains?</seg>

<seg id="352">In Kyoto, the daily newspaper Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>

<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounces as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, nationwide in accidents are involved in accidents, is quite a reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translators are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For example, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the starting text, and to transfer active voice knowledge to him in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active rest of the target language - something that is in the parent's practices. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the starting language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus a French native speaker should translate into English by the French into English - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a mother tongue, who could produce translations into English. this may be missing understanding for the transfer, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English language learners who want to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees themselves, have yet made confirmation into firsthand. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be translators, doesn't matter how good or bad his language skills actually are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic propositions, which are created by machine translation, show that this technique can not substitute for long no human translators. this applies to some languages altogether.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English coups in Japan, including the mysterious imprints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylectic reasons - not to be read or not understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be even acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or by the government that have funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto uses a reliable source of its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users claimed that they had no access to the Vivoplay online broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users found that the Internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV have no more access.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters carried out recordings of protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionist groups that rejects the Government of NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament, and the Parliament's tasks was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is being attached, and recommended to use the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsincertro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible through a blocking of the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online broadcaster. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research in the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local Internet provider will sometimes use DNS. it is a technique that, through which the DNA-server requests would answer certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers a bug or denied the request by calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS sperm: @ elongoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">Upon VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, 6th April, when the VPITV camera name Elvis Flores was arrested and carried out in prison in Caracas.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was detained in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV was broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this will keep the Venezolean access to multimedia coverage on the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something" "", "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadic, one called in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes their underage son or her underage daughter to a different, abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for it countless days of housework that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within a contract you can't raise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This is described as a cribazgo practice in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization, which fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Crifazgo - gathered testimonies, reacted and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call the things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude, that is vaccinated with criaditas, guarantees silence in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crifazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There, on the other hand, the family, who do their daughter in the belief that they do so their training, improve their position in society and making "something out of itself" can be translated to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who opens the girl with itself and justifies the exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that wouldn't have an apprenticeship, and perhaps he would be starved.</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of their employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>

<seg id="462">She risked every morning at 5 o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, pumping the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she had never had starving, but he did not get unlimited food. "I took more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge." she reminds me.</seg>

<seg id="474">Her, however, was perfectly clear that she was paid for everything they paid from them, with their hard work paid.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken about, mobbing and the chicans to whom criaditas are exposed to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a criadita.</seg>

<seg id="500">Picture of Pixabay, changes by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary committees recently voted "draft regulations regarding the use of social networks in respect to the use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">If it is accepted by the Parliament, users and social media must be registered in Egypt at a government agency to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would then be arranged to provide civil rights, citizens and citizens to share social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with adopting the law, user-users would have to register with their right name and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it hurts to do this, this could bring a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six parks, and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application that runs through the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video message and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is passed since it is assumed, as the Egyptian authorities are supposed to set up the user's user experience. it is unclear, as those who make up those who are unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on stage of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a useful user name and a password to get through the Firewall that the Facebook is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to judge a firewall at national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians, to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">However, it is not known that such plans stand out.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts and experts on site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (based on German-conducting research scientist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights," says Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and understanding any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they forcibly control physical and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "when I take them seriously, it means that they must request a strong surveillance system to request citizens" "" "to monitor citizens" "" "and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people, and also to bring them to a lawsuit." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative mandate and the constitutional committees, before it goes into a plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "is in line with a pro-military memart in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and assured that there is no separate narration on the image area," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative situation against Cyber Crime, in which a life-long sentence for those intended to be found guilty on "public order to threaten" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">Up in the top of the Kurdistan region in the northeastern Iraq region, the veterinary surgeon Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation in Nature decided to protect the European-European leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of Leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot, endangered.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predatory in the Kurdish ecosystem." and the health and the growth of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is available.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopards actually is low and goes towards zero. as the team is therefore fixed in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera-all, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained Biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of their country, which is not only composed of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in field trials for six years and involved in educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">It has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is making sure that protection zones for wild animals be established in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still rebuilding the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, a documentary that was responsible for the northeastern Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the past six years has been affected by the "three-fold catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was an etectable prefectures in Japan's Northeastern, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring towns of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to vanish, because the tsunami had vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Again, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, so on that alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo show from local point of view which progress has been reached six years after, in order to rebuild the life of local companies.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and also survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">Residential construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by the end of December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (by a note of the left-screen, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the biggest success among the three prefectures in Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">At the same time, Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Still, six years after the disaster, evacuated from Behelfsborates (by the left, casetsu juutaku) resettlement to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in pertaining housing.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people still lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation of the evacuation, which have been resided after the disaster in comfort shelters were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">According to the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 out of 1100 schools, who were affected by the disaster, have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures are much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now reactive again in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fisheries were restored to their operations.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agricultural land had caught large scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destruction of Fukushima, lying in the "Nuclear Power zone".</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but also Fukushima happened far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist taxes in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent in the same state as before the disaster. Fukushima, however, can only feature 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it has become more difficult to gain their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared on the next big earthquakes?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a full picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuation by. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and, as did their feel toward the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey through to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of the resident population has taken measures to be taken in order to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still hasn't been done enough in catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention, also to the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture also had to be a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were more than 23 000 people, back after Fukushima, had been moved to long-lasting houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of its home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evacuation, which still has to come back in Behelfsximately, are older than 50 years old. they must compete in proper building projects, because the efforts have to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, with massive construction projects. here, it is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come from other countries, which speak another language, the differences seem to be greater than the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, it is often noticeable that more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, extend our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately became very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look forward to that global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat subjects that get less attention in the coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected to anyone about language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Kriconi speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Toreta Camarasa is thinking about how to return to the music the lack of joint language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time that they worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looking back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the Federal university of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors executed him on Saturday and now put him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus who quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures also recognize the face of police officers, who attacked with a ravine. the man was identified by Augusto Sampaio.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer will be beaten by a protesters and land on the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the whole suppression would therefore be justified.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado is calling further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political force: here, the activist of Guilherme was murdered by his father, because he was sabotaged the Occupy Movement in Secondary, and here we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who had been attacked by a policeman, who had attacked him with a whip on his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police handles</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which there came to brutal police demonstrations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen put protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers, rubbersome and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The Euro MP Flavio Serafini, Social and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to abandon violence against protesters.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media street protests have feigned by pushing the focus on another, unexpected protagonists: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and estado de S. Paulo reported a cerebral glass windows to illustrate their cover-pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo prefer a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken windows than the protests of thousand people who serve the defense of a specific case.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must be recognized even if you are striving against any form of damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Even here, the term "Vandalism" is a weird, undisproportionate meaning, and the typical actions of the military police are linked by headlines with the demonstrators "protesters on the confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Those of Uninduced Lost villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the legislation of Ãlvaro Reynoso made almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba. (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a Central - in Spanish Zuckeritif - well known, regardless of what there are no notable sugar beers locally.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar tube factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the sucrose, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its plants remained, until only the scaffold made of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some rarely change the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes every day to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldiveterer who opens every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis is robbed in the sugar tube industry.</seg>
<seg id="634">He stopped working in the East of the region of sugar tube factories, which are after a long inactive time, because they became preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us exactly that in MaÃ±alich would have received the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resistance to plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, Inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news could have been a motive for the country in some decades, but the bad faith are not a curiosity more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically obsolete, and is hardly competitive in the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar plantations and sugar crisis in the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless, the sugar price increased by about one decade again.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report" "" "agricultural spectively" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar-export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come down with safety in history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">The process of restructure began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years, a total of 98 sugar factory factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about closure of the factory, is the word he repeats most, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all of those questioned are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially distributed documents, which would only be removed in terms of the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility and the letters were always more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money," he assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years of age, waits for retiring in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in his will at the shutdown of the factory, where building he helped, involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each of them he did, he disfigured one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector in Cuba and the most important workstation was extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases no alternatives for working and services, which were generated in the municipalities in which they were located, were created.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut-speech of 21 October 2002, the then president in the eyes of the present person saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use, everything went well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the People's parish Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich discovered that many things change, but not always for better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory was closed, or better, when they began to unzip it, they stopped listening to the road leading to asphalted, this disadvantageous other establishments.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to search other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were made to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future perspectives, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory created, whose production is not even served for the care of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene returned to the plant Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began working.</seg>
<seg id="682">Nineteen adult soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Peso a month to spend the years retire in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin colour, small, with few teeth and clearer voice, is no thoughtful person, yet he gives the lies that they told him not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have been watching him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene is about 65 years old in retirement, not because he is lacking in power, but because he is bittered.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youngsters of First Nations communities in all Canada are involved with topics that are important for them. they do well with hip hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">Since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan tour, mobile sound studios are available directly at schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were directed by the Pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop will contribute to the fact that the young participants in our conversations are as "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever the sense does.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main character.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia, and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the district of the Kitzkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the theme of a video player to convey how important the acquisition of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences by the globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters of the first Nations have not always supreme.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help of Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are located close to the entrance, near the entrance, shokuhin sanpuru (hold a note, "Plastics models of dishes") served by every food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of Kappabashi, there is a variety of these small companies making those plastic dishes produced by the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they do not even notice them anymore. a new trend is transformed, however, in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogitinii published series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in the special sale: new with plastic ripped celled bands, such as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artists were turned to kitschy objects, as in this case, refrigerate magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shox fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essays will increasingly become waking up.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell-support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also, this part is manufactured in Tokyo for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which can hold your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing Anflug into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile-designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and salmon are used, a popular Topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can betray my mobile phone with laughing?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also be used to surprise a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile support has the shape of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">Furthermore, there are rice balls (onigiri), earrings and hand molybdeners from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skurrile plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag #</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district that devotes itself to the food industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "struggle against drug trafficking in Mexico, they are appearing regularly in statistics. however, this is not reflected in the magnitude of human tragedy that brings the struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of Sinaloa Kartells, thronged the stories of the victims of the conflict totally in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks to the mourners or to the churches which have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each bone fund, behind each bone fund, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds perhaps will never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal animal PolÃ­tico is called the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking,") is set to give up a voice and stories of people who directed the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organizational crimes can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug trafficking and so many municipalities have to go many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video with the title "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear lives") tells of that stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father that seeks every weekend hidden graves after his son.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprera Vivir con el narco," explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leaders.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a director of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter in which form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I already know illness and sensory journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I have over every day at newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with images that are actually only from a textbook for criminology, or acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equal or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is big. and it is not normal that people talk about the "heroic" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">To me, as if they have fallen those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to blot numbers in a statistic will be.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of human beings is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighboring village that they were "soaked."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they're trying to agree that they are spared of such tragedies when they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">"" "Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" "" "Four Days Expressings in the Main Event:" "" "how a family has been plundered with the threats of" "" "how armed criminals spoiled for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also their family apart." ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, trauma remains, the fear comes up again, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She finished her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deduct or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these horrible days if weeping would solve my deep root feelings, but the reply is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega released the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a" generation of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the margins of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells about how to cook the egg, potatoes, tortillas warm, and "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He relates the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy to all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five, she told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he saw just several blocks from his home, the bloody dead body of his father saw that had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence committed by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and Government of the United States government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only some hundreds of thousands of stories that can leave organised crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories still live in view of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico launched the data journalism project Narcoliosis, whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the past four decades, in a comprehensible manner.</seg>
<seg id="816">When a picture worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" by Flickr users Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the pages where he is linked, include pictures where violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rumor, or to expose a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years that has appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to pass on.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been used misleading, tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology by Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DRC, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">However, it throws questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank-car crosses the village Sange in the east of the DR Congo, Kippte and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the war of Africa, Africa's second biggest country had been neglected and devastated. the streets in the region have become too dangerous blockades, having been difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, it fell victim to the filling station.</seg>
<seg id="828">Government officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses including a cinema in the vicinity, which was full of people who graze the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses were scattered and carbonated corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the disinfection.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture with the title" "" "This is Nigeria" "". "from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows ranks of a stolen body, which are stringed on the ground while they have a look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But the story doesn't end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same picture taken over several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but they falsely attributed to tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the escaped Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before whom they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down, and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">But the figures could not be confirmed. "no one remained back to count corpses," said a people to Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite imagery the follow-up time could be presented.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unresolved, but the army rule in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigerias and the trial of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here, the picture comes from the DRC again, when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">Indeed, this incorrect use of the image from the DR Congo is only documented in a number of errors; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange was also in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported some of the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared as the following which brought these descriptions out with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news side, which was falsely claimed by President MyAnmars Than. in addition, monk and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from the DRC to investigate this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frame) that pass through these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussion on the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians through Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas through Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is valued at a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion can understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigate how pictures are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers don't give this images longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tiny people who have unintentionally used to practice water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of error and falsehood that actual atrocities are untrue and tasted the real horror of what is actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images has already been debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that this returns from pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images and viewer desensitize and viewer desensitize the ability to empathy empathy (such as those study, which effect the nonviolent media on it, to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some sort of nonviolent representations in the news media, fact is fact that it is essential for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists have experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you'll have to think about this situation in which a picture suggests about what is actually solved from the context or completely misuse species.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons was used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. unavoidable) strives to provide language fans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in each language: they express certain situations or emotions, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmistakable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others, which are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example, Spanish chotesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resist stubbornly in every attempt to an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not sufficient, why a complete explanation, and sometimes somewhat context needed to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and Linguist von "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find out words from the Vanuatu Vanuatu language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">'vakasteglok "- Get you in recognition of your parents in recognition of your parents, how to strive for your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language, which are spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that you feel after the cold days in the sun has dared.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disgrind other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, as we want to analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of this "unerrable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are greatly appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite photos here.</seg>

<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practiced our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with that Muslim to be a Muslim, but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is well designed in our collective performance such as Muslims, which as I do not fit there, are musculated.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narratively overshadowed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the US couldn't even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that if French, Muslim women are hammered to carry their headscarf in public buildings, Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, which are both of both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an option here and now, despite a language barrier with someone related to someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the stories of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported by Steven Bird's other initiative by Steven Bird, the ineffable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS does not relate to the written word, but in the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain the speech versatility of large cities and worthy.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, it is in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project, to:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents should not forget who they are to dah.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "during" "" "listening often it is often connected to understand" "" "take these events instead" "" "to hear, to feel, to do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers represent their story in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and its representation is to ensure that the audience would have to be established.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is related to the language Dafing. during this round, the story of Rassidatou hunts the opportunity to explain the story of typical customs of earth.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the fable of hare and the baboan in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he declares the meaning of his fable, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grass, he shares his feeling of exclusivity:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can get in contact with TLS in order to arrange their own story-counting tunes.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a new inspection of public debt in Puerto Rico, which amount to $72 million in public debt, diverse religious and civil organizations involved in a mass demonstration; the march started in the puerical Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (citizenship for the Neuroration of Debt) and the Ãkomenish Church Council of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocate of the rejection of debt also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demands that politicians, banks and government authorities, responsible for debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We demand a financial examination and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions, which is in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are squeezing and suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Centre for New Economy," a non-governmental non-profit organization with a focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">On the outset, measures are imposed without the participation and belief of citizens danger to be rejected by the people.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian Palestinian web developer of Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, supporters and family advocates the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he provided for an open net.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist who produced in France by so-called 'book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, noses excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Intro (The Cost of Freedom: a collective reproduction).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book which was published last year and is explicitly available here, includes a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built, and what the real costs are associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers, who have involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on site to watch over the nebula, which surrounds our newsfeeds and to create something from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Basle Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted by the Adra prison directory, where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory portion of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and they want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of time-wise overbeliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer of Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra Prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police bases upon the basis of a "strictly secret" of the military court in Adra's cell.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it had been contacted by persons on November 12, 2015, who were self-employed as the Insider of the Assad government and put them knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place to stay and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects like Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the Internet access and knowledge for around the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently superseted by the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Pasha's cultural prototypes were looking ahead as the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the trail of numerous civilian populations, and merge in Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS was all about doing this architecture that does not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule created to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable importance.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet close this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life in order to dream of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed if I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel made me English, even when he was already detained.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and write English good.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught others to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel open me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other imprisoned men as they exploit computer, at least in theory, without knowing them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband, when he was detained in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She skipped the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated them into English from the Arabic.</seg>

<seg id="1227">Here's an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It's happening with every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">To sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I lose the mind in the moment, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">Whatever the dangers doesn't matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, bands and guardians</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prison wheel of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I will answer you in every detail of your voice and words;</seg>
<seg id="1235">Which I bear with passion for my passion,</seg>
<seg id="1236">If your eyes say Lebeat</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul...</seg>
<seg id="1238">I quickly return to my loneliness,</seg>
<seg id="1239">In order to recover all the moments,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile on your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify about myself, that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the detention of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">One year goes, my soul</seg>
<seg id="1244">While, while</seg>
<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage.</seg>

<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We are repeating our demand today in hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambik: due to corruption, the director after the release of corruption was resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corrupt accident, with which a government member returned to the workplace at the state machine, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">In this case, Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and were sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Rat Cambaza was between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of a good guidance and immediately requested his reinstatment to the company, which happened on April 19th, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a position of the General Attorney General of the Republic to refer the application, there was no obstacle to reference to Cambaza, again to restrain his old post, since the company did not do any disciplinary procedure after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants did not feel good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to restore the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and even a step back in regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that even the company should have a disciplinary procedure against the trailers.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently, however, apparently and caused no reasonable legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behaviour as well and considered the case as "contradicted":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be counselors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half consumed half.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could consult and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has approved to be integrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Untrue!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director possessed no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State, because he did not believe him, I cannot believe someone was rewarded in such a way that the state has already offended so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals to serve and serve the state, * he had already serving a unique opportunity to serve the state, but himself has only served itself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was using the state as handing to become an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man, who was finally charged and eventually sentenced to a long term in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Prora Machel prison will not only remain as the first independent president in memory, but rather as a sharp, single-cutting and - by side by prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactic, but he doesn't turn from its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is the same crime. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, reactions were also leaning:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he sat down 10 years and came free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company places him with whom he mischief, again under contract. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - ÑÎ±accidentally. (@ azure _ Rafik) 12th May 2017</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or age-aging.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Disported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to information by Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they abstained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Even though the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin, or are generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "" "" ("" "" Kalar "" "") as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radically nationalist movements has given an extremely low connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nationalists as an hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar'i usually like to be associated with racism, but the word on itself doesn't automatically call them in Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also poker hosts, in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about its use, were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burmesous words with different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was cleared today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether they could, how he could relive his back pain by making a wording.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Heller is the opinion that they will decrease radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook has to be analytic to spread racism in the suspicion of ism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you are writing on Facilook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, be carefully analyzing the mail and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age-aged).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that this dreamy nationalists, which hate speech language, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action likes to send a strong signal to all of them that hate speech language, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a cat and mouse game, with the user to use social networks to use a new word or an alternative writing of censored Word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to erase his posts when he only wanted to communicate his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was saying to me the liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the Post has not answered the Facebook Community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a wide range of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who are simply trying to show their opinions to hate speech-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, who has nothing to do with Hasselt:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without Hasselspeech is removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the mail, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine thinks that Facebook has more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community would ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benign intention of reducing racism into Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">These words to censor shall only bring more hatred inside the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support, and so words like "stool" or "Inhercurry" prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsely solved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits they would have a great revenue, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks are automatic censorship for much reproach to users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now feel funny and write the word 'Kalar' in the context of Hasselt, to see if their posts will be taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no Hasselt, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch a genetic curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to try if Facebook is the post office, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious Fundamentalists who have social networks have used to expand their votes and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hasselt should also attack power in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been used for his failure to bring the out-out Hasselt to his burial sites under control, criticized.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of trying to censor the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of marriage, some members were held duciistic and Muslim religious communities on the practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group that would not interfere with representatives of the various religious groups of the country, that the state should not interfere with the country, since that, the old age does not have the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contract partner of the UN Child Labour Convention, the minors of children under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had been married 15 had already been married to Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent, and 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's official statistics confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitioning and social media movements that endeavoured to abolish laws to children before, followed at the foot, and rejoiced with great support. no doubt they helped to bring this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say the critics of the children before they ought to be damned to care for their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition did not sort of tensions within this really complicated matter, and some point came by doubts about whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which could be discussed in the House of Representatives, so that it would be a simple majority to the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree to the law and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle has once again posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft bill of the children's toe was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 voices, and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws before they were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovel Francis, who held a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary griede, which does the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's right now is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that's worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely a long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook of Lara Quentall- Thomas, which says:, "Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The sacred age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on change of marriage was today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The House of Representatives has 41 members and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members who were against, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's toe is not permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childmarriagemarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have cast him out.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congrats.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thanks to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook is made in the form of satellite Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">A few months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and it seems to be able to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney, Paris Al rawi, a disco-advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimely when Maharaj was against the law, most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat if, instead of talking about the debate so generally, in a way that we invite to talk about the problem, that the state, our daughters may seem to be persuaded that they may be abused against big, hard-filled men who are compared to them, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a criminal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places around the world where the children's positions are legal or still the norm, even though there is laws that they subsist.</seg>

<seg id="1391">Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, as opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright legislation in the USA, internationally divisaged.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Since more than one month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "the day is more clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and fans and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniquered Internet users are used to use relocking tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been closed since 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently published in a report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been portrayed to find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the most famous country in the world, when it comes to Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, several mirrors are available (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution was based on IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain name and makes complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is posted, however, in spite of the illegal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (beyond the sources of Wikipedia), we used everything to dismantle snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the contents based on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if they can't get the www.wiktionary.org website.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also contributed that this step is irrespective of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansipepedi.org, a mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hove similar mirror sites when Wikipedia is closed on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported sub-hashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, an Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">It is accessing a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the Server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around and never satisfied. they were blurred with poached motifs and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with yourself and try to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepals, wants to bring to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home location next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that give attention to Nepals.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the rim of the Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what better is better for a passionate game photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just felt at home when Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that the shore of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the Leopard was found and I immediately began to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims a cooperation with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepals and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he had already standing tiger face toward face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of sheep in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of darkness in the way home when suddenly the king of Buonks appeared. he sits immediately, we look forward to and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar provides the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent in order to capture at the Bardia National Park recordings of asps. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger, and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community-organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, there are women with greatest care, to speak the name of their husbands or even by older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women give women to respect husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm to preserve these practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state Ogeta by an illusioned court and violated her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives is also not common in their name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer positions to fear, if ever, they should not come in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, there were nine women, including health professionals and housewives, a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the hostility of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">When one of 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelbathal, operated by the community video volunteering and settling for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paola has been working for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the cover of practices, such as children's marriage to the end of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and conducts this clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women, and at the same time they have made to ambassador inside the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, did not mention their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided on this issue because they wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, so that women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To acquiring the names of their husbands, is a rob that they all found guilty and have never asked in question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes it a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered a prisoner, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted we have never thought about that discussion round about that discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never mentioned her husband before, had never felt at home at home, as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Practicing, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in our luggage, Rohini started its first discussion starring.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchate" never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">According to the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked any participant in the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, lovingly and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then asked them all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they could call us as they want us, means that they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands on the lips," says Rohini Pawas in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the entire exercise, she only turned out and choked. another decided to allow the whole accustomed frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression of their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">It was still in adrenaline exchange to have broken with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they were actually trying to call their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the coming days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put on the head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law urged them, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participating in was less understandably and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnored point on its forehead, indicating the speststatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnored dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women never stopped doing so, but believe that they are now in a better position, even to carry him not to carry him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we packed lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about those who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives and talked about things they had never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been insisted on some things like our identities to our husbands, never talked to honestly.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talk about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried away only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of this is okay, but some wanted a Salute-Kurta, a vast shirt of a trousers, wear it; they did not get darnel.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion on the advantages of its own wardrobe, morality associated with Saris and much more, dingy Rohini their own pair of turta (upper hand) in a discussion round so that women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since their first disdiscussion, Rohini has been confirming that things come slowly into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women rehearsed them a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, myself included, are still doing it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women at Discussion Club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like a hurting to more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard-navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving themselves each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club, each of us gives us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when any woman walks in the club home and other people reported what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably recently made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of prisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancers at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for "Subversion" on the basis of the Charter 08, a manifesto which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department of Foreign Affairs in China referred Lius case as "an internal affairs." he told it as "not required to discuss this issue with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China will continue to release calls from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poets of Liu Xia, release or to permit him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, other countries are wholly gone.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has put out some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Hands Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brenets have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway took part in the Stocks after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Liu, although the Norwegian government hasted that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to return to China, because the exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously injured, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu a to withdraw his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to withdraw his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling to China, Liu and his wife immediately withdraw from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as they hasted in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We expect that China elevates all limitations of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits, which they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the message on 27 June that the message to the Chinese authorities could not only release Liu, but also his wife Ms. Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The summons from the US embassy attracted a raging answer from China, with the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country have the right to intervene and irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel expenses and access to medical care of his choice, which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as the international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to ousting Liu and his wife unconditionally released.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German government, Steffen Seibert, said that Liu explains all the medical support which he needs, and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters, that China had major concerns about whether the vortex may be overshaided to Liu's visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on Liu to provide a reasonable medical care and give him the opportunity to leave his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told him that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells more:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold his international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, and to exercise the rights of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China in a statement on 29 June to release Liu from humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he, irrespective where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the land, the Foreign Ministry announced that no further information is published if France would eventually get it up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the Foreign Affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June to meet Liu, and to show a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party called on China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, revealed in a statement on 28 June by Liu very worried and gave him that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and responsible for which he had contributed to a harmonious, stable and wealthy China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very well and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who stood for Charter 08, who stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or Country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Justice Minister K. Shancourgam there should be Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of the State of New York, the Minister of New York noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That's it, with most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Blog Cavalierio accused the Ministry of Justice, "to twist logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, we would say that we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had a flight to escape from the responsibilities, a priority.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons performed by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of what, he appeared continuously undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are led permanently from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratically.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old corpse comes back from the authoritative government, who pretended to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judicative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Relevant issues tarried with non-answers rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shancouramalgam to illustrate his opinion because she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our recruiting K Shancourgam would take the effort to clarify this point where it was paid up to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog, he points out on the reviews that you should begin to read the entire script of the conference, so that you could understand the context of the testimony of Shancourgam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" as a country, "he stated why the elections in Singapore were so unsafe, even if we rejoice free and appropriate choices.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He has reached Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore was not a country, "he obviously does not mean it in that sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shancourgam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the minister of Justice of Singapore has said very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what awaits me - was I understood with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shancouramalgam, member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore I have doubts and I'm not sure if he really believes that he is really associated and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review disassembles the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shancouramalgambled a mistake "or was it a Freudder speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country do the sovereign rights of the city go back to Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government of government, the statements of Mr Shancourgam are meaningless importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, and do not defend their own city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay our Prime Minister's Accounts?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "the" "" "Journey of a Decade" "", "was added to Singapore and was always a city:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have upset many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island nation.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but that is not true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should talk of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered courteous to show interest in his dialogue partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, usually the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians can cook in anger when they are kept for Americans, but doesn't disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes between Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible to their rucksack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">By contrast, Americans....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was, when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - by the world of Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First, as "nice" to be called "to be" nice "means to be spearful - as well as the guttural, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders," The Simpsons "(who has one own Canadian double darker).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation of people like Ned Flaners, that would indeed be a step forward. but the actual problem is that "nice" does not have a personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing where you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and to make no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even be able to say that the desire to be free and only to be one of the Canadians of Canadians is.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band released a music video that seized power in 2014 and restore power in 2014 despite its promises to restore the civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about how to make his girlfriend.</seg>

<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists trained to see this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as well as the situation of the country under the Junta dominion.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these shots of the video, which relate to some of the political themes involved in Thailand in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the draconical section 44 of the provisional Constitution which is given to the commander-in-chief of the army general decision making major national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "creation of creation" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered a critic of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the implementation of the law on computer criminal, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to oversee online content and individuals who accused the monarchy to have slanders the monarchy, prosecute prosecuted persons.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is a strikward interview against "Lese Majestic" (Majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, Thailand was proclaimed the martial law.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a putsch of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to buy is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is needless and a waste of control.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video is even shown how persons are thrown onto a black delivery van, before it brings them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly instigated "confusion" in society and on Internet uses long term penalties, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the hydrobasins of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, lakes, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked to soils in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and Abchases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called goat cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district was 16,000 people, after it had barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">Cross the path of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Braachula, it is located on the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican female, a small woman carrying a coral-pink Brillenframe and golden-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Braachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars a night sleeping the guests in easy rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in one cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people come in full minibuses and from the top part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment, it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez had already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">They don't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to the hospital, if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm that drew out of the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa had a reasonable peak name for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurt) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answered with a smile." "" "I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal for a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other people accompanied by Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He relates that the Haitians and the Afrikaner often travel together the route and that the Africans speak on WhatsApp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companion, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at construction of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy has been weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells the SIM card to save the necessary money to purchase the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our Mother, and we never let it go again," he responds to smile. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells that their guests have often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very popular here, but it is not the only sparks hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">On the other end of the city a Sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family have taken refuge in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is Polizist and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold to expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the ceiling on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled after a raid on his workplace from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants, traveling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an omnipresent, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the gears, the travellers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has 20 new guests, much of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandma, she ignites her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair care that you have made a client, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, kids and old people.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed sad, while she briefly introduces her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fuerone," reiterates it every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication equipment in Xinjang of Twitter users. keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in the west of China, are compelled to install Spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users of the Tianshan district of Urumqi, a cell phone call, in which it shows the district government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app will" "" "send access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had replaced messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Notification of the Police, the App meets the sources and the distribution routes of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a service provider with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic web pages, by online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to give users attention how much time they spend online and to control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can, of course, be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" or even hacker can be able to manipulate or steal the home network of a person or from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements are about digital censorship in China mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, afflicted ethnic minority interests such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often classify extreme temperatures and surveillance measures as well as routinemulated Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media outlet "Images from Mainland China" (a try-out), the censored news published in China showed photographs from a checkpoint where police officers had randomly checked the residents, whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure the people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are using a checkpoint using a unit without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use equipment that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by adding resource technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China again.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"Images from Mainland China" (Separating them out.) and also released a Jingwang product description, which emerges that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system, allowing full access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang, computers and cellphones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the orders of the city council, to minimize the distribution of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions from the cyber security office on the operation of their computer and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external disks, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media storage cards."</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos," however, the personality rights of Urumquis is three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole number of different reference price, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure you with him, and you can't keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not yet enough, why they cast the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">During my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had worked once as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal job equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had used four cables in each other to present us from their point of view, great invention of a giant Cabal.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them changed, while I was still in the series.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which I heard screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker noted the cooling, and found no pleasure at all, which is why he pressed the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity pierced my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-bodied body, stretched out on the ground was the perfect power conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The pain disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lay down my sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which came to me as minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "the door opens and the morning light meets the room" "" ".Raus with you, Arschfuck" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I answered with the voice of an inexhaustive youth:" "" "my Lord, my father must make terrible worries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">Be quiet and walk away, you will be moved. "</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he smiles on his screen, sometimes on his computer, and back to his couch again.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What you can leave, is a cigarette between his fingers, or his nicotine-spotted lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which heard them since 1967; the year in which Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felyeen (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative Majority and their well-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapists.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With its music, which often concerns itself with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only found in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of Sanaa.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib is regarded as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and it can help people with the people that suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if it doesn't open it, it sweeps against US foreign policy a special dislikes.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib describes his art in Amman in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, something with its identity as "Palestinian refugee of second generation" - so he signifies himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life circumstances," Hdaib is emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a person," "" "while he is a person soldered nest cafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast sunrise up to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also says that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has some weakness for breaking through ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has a little bit of coffee at a sentimed junitag little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily freedom of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when you throw a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Thus, it simply avoids it easy to do fundamental things - as in public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry had cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Several members of Parliament that support the Islamic Republic - argued that the Muslim orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-trader Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert table.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the members of the Islamic coalition of Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "had been canceled" "" "due to sexual orientation of the scary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, Human Rights and Free Speech in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses an ancient legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which still decided to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be the rhetoric of the rhetoric, but actually a clearer-crystalliative reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib made traditional gender norms to body, formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had the premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a apparently downlighted unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past years, the number of 'honourable' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch suggested that, in 2016, the number of honourable species reached its zenith in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is still lacking to support the women who attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fragile control of the year 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, "and for their release often a long bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the family's guarantee is necessary for nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for it, not to relocate the themes in his country as tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, that he is his music, which is full of explicit attachments to sexuality, freedom and expression, does not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was dubbed politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" there is a focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">During the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a sort of market in which you can get what you want, "it is faith or faith, heterogeneous or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there were hardly anyone who speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on LGBTQ + individuals were greatly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to remember that his comments were taken out of the context, twisted and addressed his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib touts the Arab LGBTQ + community, and represents the opinion that intolerance on homosexuality is not spoken against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuanything, a eighth century poet, who still has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib is wondering: if Abu Nuanything, who later should work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, did not have anything with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled to do.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Agency held several former government officials and members of the teachers, with the reason that they had expressed concerns on comments in social media, related to the deeply rooted corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In the face of this is the concert of Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress has been intentional and taking. Jordan has denied a performance for the second time, but the road of progress - such as Hdaib - consists of slow, bedbattles and internalised changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">At the end, Hdaib dreams, as millions of other Arabs also, out of an Arab world without Interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreamt not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to live" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is concerned using music, art and literature from a real and basic openness - and not by bombs, streaks and artificial type-headed democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it happens, Hdaib will resemble and therefore resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman is a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories to the origin of the Nebula festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the drums, the drums and dancing over a thousand years ago have come from the West Japan in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to force in its knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, therefore we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I've been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortresses are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival, the only True - and still a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched my # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high tower car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rare were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the sparks.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic centre of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road noise and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other medium and South American countries - increasing demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance, and therefore the unusual hairstyles by famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to give you more norveers into the experienced hands of hairdressers, which can reproduce this elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the utmost limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of Friseure "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts can compete against each other to show who can create the excentric circles of them, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools, and instead of bad advice to get a training in hairdresser's art, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the potential opportunities have seen dozens of young people, that they can take a profession, currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year in March, and reported some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the working version of the Beiter "Liebesgements, guerrilla fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more importantly, people who are outstretched out, give affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga von der Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired her to write the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), young people encouraged to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Just recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government concluded a peace treaty with the guerrile movement of FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the Nobel Peace Treaty was so important that the president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for its merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before columbianers there is still a long way until one can talk about a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillatroopers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried around the clock their weapons with themselves, must now integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, which was accustomed to life in constant fear, and in some cases, have to absorb deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, this now has to support them in their ranks and support them in construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian had to close together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And precisely that they did: by now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters - which should be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak to Mount Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This declared that we love the people who love to letters to the Valentine's Day on Valentine's Day, but those who need it much more necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told us to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent customer.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So, the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2,000 letters were collected in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would be forgiven "</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotenes site to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC on how they had done earlier in order to counteract the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive commands but letters full of submissions from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings could go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between," says the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor del Cauca province, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After having passed the letters, a former fighter made me of the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of tabernacle, in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to enter, because beside him on bed there was a MGL shooter, a lethal weapon in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "and I said to him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It's a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life, someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it. "suddenly, my tears went over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I strongly embraced him, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this struggle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life as a war. he was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of the famine. "I would have never thought someone would be forgiven for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a company outside there, who is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to handle weapons with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the first time, students and a leader of the FARC went to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up as well as war and the FARC had already seen in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice revolved on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a target of this order, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who haven't had heard yet before and had no voting rights, and to recognise that the people I often have seen as a monster, and even hate people with beautiful feelings that were turned around through their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, where the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - also those who have killed and so much harm have caused us to contribute to a smile and a hug and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JeÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombia seeded that peace would reign according to disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and protest to their rights, and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution, and bring sacrifice, because we know of own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend the life as the foundation of existence, will be impending many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Homosexual and queer people living in the Caucasian region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and extortion.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With terror, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat, like a Damoklash value over the LGBTQ community depends, did not come on overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago, after reports were published, causing the towing, torture and killing men in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities, who took to suspecting queere men and put them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a wife, was born in Grozny, and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">From her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they were grown up, her aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After having experienced a group of Chechnya on her family wife, the hunt was opened at Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She moved out of fear for her life last end to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper at a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took them without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I was trying to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them no more to Chechnya that you can eliminate this disgrace? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made by the WhatsApp go round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing just a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another set, but this time in Chechen: "how long do you still honour the family, you shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and waxed last end to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had received everything and screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two tenants in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nurse were you laid - in whom the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are dated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats of threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmarggling.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd requirements: some told me, I have to prove it by going up by the streets; others wanted me to rise in the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was only bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what would I have to say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family go to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mum on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world, not just your family, but the whole republic has hurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you need to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she made herself a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved in an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened windows and a number sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time happened, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends reviewed the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember all of them, they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still do not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought myself a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came up and checked the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment, when I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you would be in safety, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">People already know, in which hotel you are on. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I would not overcome this sealan barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to watch the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the present situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are gone?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had eaten one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan had not been arrested and tortured, yet all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he didn't lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end, require a proof that the so-called "honour" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in this secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it just wouldn't be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relations or that have been dropped by their relatives to place the Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present themselves as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but dipped to radicalizing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a supremacy or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in Argun in a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people had disappeared in this prison after their beard grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was involved himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not introduced as a bandits, there were no reports yet. however, we believe that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave off?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know, whether these persecutions and kidnappings belong to people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already in 2003 I was already familiar with Grozny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to introduce ourselves to "" "" civil society "" "," but ultimately cast us back into the Stone Age. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every night, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew it. they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen "language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't mock about the misfortune of another. "</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they are making fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes off before you, because they thought you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted, never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnome Time held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking about morals in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not say about us, but primarily on the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had vowed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicating with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreels, together, I am guiding them to the hospital, helping them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't miss a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself, when I cut off places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alot.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has absolutely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who wanted to do with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bulls at them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagests have those who have the Kabardiner who have those who have Russians also who, on all the planet, are they - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is annoying to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims walking into the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of identity card to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a decay.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be precise, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know I'm myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn before an increase of self-murder within the impoverished Arab ancestral community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase of self-murder.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab ancestral community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child. he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness prevailing to return inability to his family, such as ancestral human rights groups, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which has occurred in August within the Arab ancestral minority, and activists warn from the spot that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbaus, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamar.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: there were all family events that felt free because of persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of feeding their families and to work safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab ancestral azi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which most of the Arab communities living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 to complete the efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas areas in Iran, as well as some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, regional economy continued to develop only slowly, and the native population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied its involvement in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of constrains, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to destroying the devastation caused by dryness causing destruction, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fishing and palm-palms.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab Ahawzi-adolescents now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of co-operation, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of Ahwazis, who have completed a job, finished primary school, finished 55% of a secondary school and 45% have university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national contradictions"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist with London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of self-murder among young ancestry men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">In particular, Dohimi said that particularly the unemployment had become more worse. this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since function and institutions don't prefers Arab workers, the local Arab Jamahiazi will dispossessed access to workfacilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, to destroy and destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to earn their livelihood outside of their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surnames to hide their affiliation to the ancestor, since even Arab names will not be tolerated at the workplace, because the speech of Arabic language or the Traction of Arabic clothes are not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the circumstances caused by the Arab Jamahiazi, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, if the world wake up and knowledgeable about it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why not unidentified myself with feminism, even with the intersectional do not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women, especially white women, signify themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You are wondering why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even well thought well-thought scientific and social arguments from me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all Feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards are still responsible for women sooner or later in diverse areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and familiar.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to skin color, on racism, on black cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; if I consider what kind of feminist movement has been used, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless they all agree that women - all women should come together to lift their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing "to achieve the equality (some of the women's equality).</seg>
<seg id="2449">"" "" "" "but they don't want to talk about sexualised violence an institutional form against racial violence, which we have exposed black women to double-fold ways." ""</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and country of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all men, all men and all human beings are not any skin colour of the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot take myself as black woman to take into account of the white woman who refuses to take care of the sex as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am tired and I'm not going to fight any more about my affiliation in a white-feminiist sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women and repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in 1851." "" "am I not a wife?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology during which the black woman is a defied and marginalised nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to include groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to drive their egcentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not attempt to draw white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to disclose the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to render women of different origin and limits himself from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to resolve myself full and completely from feminism and to join me of the Womanism which was called for my dark skin and my status as woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubbornful that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever, that we define black women to our own ideas and give us into the sphere, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: as we can recappoint ourselves, in which they can define ourselves on our own way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered to the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately retrieved, after reading these lines, I plead to inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic area, I can lift the women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I become recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kursk. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# Holder), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said that Ada BÃ¡ez said it was nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of its relationship there was a bit of time and the police said that their statement would not be laid down, but more could you do.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the acuskunk ad of Ada BÃ¡ez did not benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women want to advertise at all, they generally don't get support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women also depend on men, which they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Behaviour1 strokes and Statistical 2 Invisible abuses and a legal system that is not inferior to unnippment 3: good approach, flawed realization and stats</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to see how many women really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institute in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports which are not even accumulated, the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Public Prosecutor's Office of 9600 adverts due to domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads found in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peacekeeping force. 86% of the ads added here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women that they were physically abuse, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show, however, not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of those offences are actually shown. "on any woman, who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychotic mistreatment, there are 9 women that do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "every woman that has been refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is no independent crime, the law enforcement agencies cannot be appropriately documented how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, reporters included a minimum of 12 cases of women in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay was at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuses and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez has been the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then, after all. this should never regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana has 28 years old and has no longer been with Carlos. but for two years she has led the psychic violence towards women, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most weightful appearance:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that myself would be victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are misfortunate because they are misleading to violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered to their posts, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against her and refused to admit his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">The other Facebook users asked Mariana so why they had dropped out of Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least had a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner had harassed them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te CREO ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all in any way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities were not a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against her former partner who developed into an unmistakable legal battle between Paraguay and its home country in which it went mainly for money, power, and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Customs legislation: good approach, defective implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of abuses is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary, "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed under the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorElla (# principalities).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiunaMenos (# nonEineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law is to explain and punish feminism into an independent offender and punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">So the legislature has changed in some points to win also the members of the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay and will be sentenced to five years in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original law plan provided, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process cost, which must carry out the victims of violence itself, if they simply wish to restore and secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay mistreatment is seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking is to take place, violence is no longer considered anything.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who keep silent in the face of these facts, bears witness, and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are gone.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must reimburse so long, mistreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted in the paraguan Senate. however, parts of the Law were changed. amongst others, a passage has been canceled that the partners were calling for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"" "the cancellation of the words" "" "gender" "", "" "" "political force" "" "and" "" "sexual harassment" "" "is considered a big setback." ""</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and revised version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kursk. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# Holder), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be imprisoned in jail where he served a one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and transferred to trial again later.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having lost his father, SaÃ¯ibn Taimur by a coup.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, along with his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the sultans is characterised by the serious efforts of security forces, especially national freedom, including press freedom, closets and human rights defending, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and imprisoned.</seg>

<seg id="2564">The Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were convicted of "abuse of public order," misuse of the Internet "and" Understanding of the Present of the State. "</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of a public domain and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year prison penalties and fines in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year jail and a fine of Â£1000 Rial (2,600 US dollars) after making use of "an information grid to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">On 22 August 2016, al-Abri was granted a bail of 5000 oman Rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2576">The constant shutdown of Azamn and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases, in which in Oman, recent times the press freedom was hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For example, the closure of the independent journal Mowatin, and the exercising of pressure on albalad, include the first independent online newspaper in the country to enroll their operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the lasting closure of Azamn and the imprisonment of journalist Al-Haj, the impression is that the omanic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the relevant violation of the press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally free;</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstanding</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, image takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom used or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing range, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for on-site medical research, there are two reasons: for instance, in the supply of the global healthcare industry, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical requirements on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have widespread effects as elsewhere, and lack of investments in the exploration of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists will be carried out in building their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can be only instrumental in the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the Center for Infectious Disease in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the epidemic of AIDS showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself insisted on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sampled health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over misconceptions of the media about these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I will support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just starved a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: out of the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw near here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it lasts months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, beginning at every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of the space, the health care system (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa opposite Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the harder access to scientific expertise, which are present here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: like "open source" seeds that change global food production.</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton already brewed in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronaut in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been reduced by its own insolvency and question as many allotments can be given to borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he realized that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents have not only been used for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or ruined leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past years, more such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereals or cardboard sites. because of this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and expert knowledge ensure food safety around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still seeks salad, however, because his work is still much more difficult for his work.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like a rock rock" "" "in a river that I must paddling with." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go to salads too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand before the court, no one can breed any more new salts because all features are already patented. "he makes it so good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavored to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It is also connected to a movement that is growing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open source reeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS drew red romaty of the variety Outredder in the greenhouse building "of the station soared and eaten. it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photograph: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds so sound like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source," which offers alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to ensure that some plant species and are not as intellectual property protected and so are useless for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Under the initiative of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders is able to undertake that others can use some cultivated seeds freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to continue doing business with their seed. "open source" breeders also allow others to breed their seeds, to breeding such own varieties, and it is not immediately expelled - two aspects, which are banned or prescribed by many plants.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds: according to him, a role in larger clings such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control of the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only little to breed seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, we need to buy control of seeds in the global agricultural industry, whose most recent examples have been announced in August and September 2016. "who is good, locally and sustainable produced vegetables, as it is offered to farmers markets, should also know the way that this vegetable is cultivated, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary superior without seeds without seeds is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to contributing other its seeds still freely. in contrast, you are contrary to patent seed and plant attributes.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photograph of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered because the available genpool due to the always abundant spiritual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted, unceasing.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, the director of the Ossi, engaged in her thesis with genetically modified variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartes are protected as intellectual property, which makes it useful for plant breeders either at all or not worthy.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are not such estimates but experts such as Luby suggests that massage-based plants such as wheat in even larger style are patented as a salad or carrot.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they have targeted description - of such, through which their taste or their color improves up to such, due to those in certain environments thrive and threats of pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Adversaries of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more than ever more patents. however, genetic diversity is currently unnecessary as ever since the changing conditions are caused by climate change much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail explains Monsanto's spokesperson Carly Scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for monopoly activities. with a total of four genius and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company set itself the conservation of the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property has other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant styles innovations" "". "" "" "there is basically a plan which everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method at the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees another: 20 years for waiting until a patent is changing, they certainly don't wear innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long for plants to breed crops, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources always had been a general public and it should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it's impossible to make us know if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton interferes with the concept of making plant features: "we are not creating the characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state, Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "he who cultivate a variety, are also breeding his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe on industrial agriculture with major farms and monocultures, are needed for cultivation of produce in herbicides, who cultivate in his varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such which move on international markets), but smaller than Monsanto are) patents have, there are most smaller seeds companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject this patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeder is innovative thanks to avoidance of plant patents innovative: "it looks like being able to produce new ideas, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need to constantly meet new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years even, "he says." with a patent one is protected 20 years before the competition, with what makes it easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seem to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, however, the concept spreads quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"" "in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "" ""), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, works the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agree is working on an open source, which ultimately became a formalistic and legally binding form of the Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeders differ from land to land, of which the Ossi commitment not simply cannot be taken one into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventional plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is part of the governments of the Member States to implement the Patent Office to implement these new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on "Open Source" Seed systems in Ethiopia, based on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all East Africa to experience something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards developing seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos "Programme for" Open Source "Seed systems, states that the organization is currently launched a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which will be scheduled to fall on the official start of next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development assistance (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others, represents a report that farmers have the opportunity to communicate to seeds, to communicate it and be ensured a stable supply with food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In this report the importance of a diverse, local supply is emphasized with seeds for sustainable food systems - an context that by the Luby of Ossi hopes that soon more people will recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the Movement for Regional and Ecological Food mainly respected, and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," "" "says Luby." "" "we are trying to clarify the people even more behind their food." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still locking the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the European Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which document human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The network released a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized and criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The General Network for Human Rights Information remains btb - despite this attack and derivation of the Egyptian law and the Constitution through the authorities that are actually defending their target to overcome the expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important as now. ANHRI, it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities have been depleted in order to overcome the blocking, and not to admit our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnist and Human Rights Research Minister Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of Colombia and articles, which he writes in Egypt unaccessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he established to circumvent the customs apparatus of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, that is home to the distributor of Ziadas blog, however, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 when he talked about the student protests and took a video how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly involved in politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada commented on the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock the blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it's for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is well done to give me the feeling of a siege to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, Charge of the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an impact, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to deal with censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian officials announced on May 24 till 06. August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etienne.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, by removing internet search and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we realized how the web pages that VPNs have started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice refers to the government's intention to block content, and filter content to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation, in addition, is concealed that the decisions are made behind closed doors, so the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction, using them to proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government prepared by censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in an emerging financial situation, the highest level of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO, the Brazilian NGO, called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio confessed newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on 16 August the Editorial" "" "That is not normal," "" "in which they announced, a new section called" "" "war in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision, the newspaper explained like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city on the world as murder, robbery, sexual savor, etc. everything, however, will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so we did not close our eyes to the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes said the chief editor of the newspaper that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper explaining that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 territories, that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper further writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, also may be used, congratulations to the police who only shoots and then asking questions to concede.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partner.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than they share?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued to designate violence as a "war." this was more difficult for a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to move to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education, and historic and self-pleasing neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">There are no such cities in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we watch the murder rates per federal state, Rio lies on No.16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is specially one of the company Globo, the largest media company South America, which, as CecÃ­lia, has been emphasized that since years the policy of security has been repeated.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To this security policy measures, the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), one of the state of Rio in 2003, was one of the police unit to capture a Favela police unit and to capture a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decrease in nonviolent deaths. however, after several years the UPP was supposed to protect against chicans and repressions against the poor communities who had to protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under fire.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux set out from one of his article in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not refer to the - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">Besides legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio also draws serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use resources and ways, which are typical for a war. this is the intrusion in the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and to object for "collateralized damages" and "veraging spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas are still suffering in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police retaliate the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avail the death of a policemen.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident also made headlines: a streseller died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011, and in the subsequent war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the UN peacekeeping organization PAX and the research institute, The Syria Institute, in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib, are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons demanded the life of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations, and the Syrian opposition, are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other Human Rights organisations, that the massacre was committed by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebels have stood under siege under siege under siege under siege, which led to the inhabitants of the locally owned or tunnel-related food, controlled by tunnel and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">By the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In response, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta, as they can plant their own fungi as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They themselves call themselves Ghouas Alenda and lead the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi does not belong to the conventional, in Syria, and are only extremely rare in the Syrian kitchen. however, its food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The declaration of the project, subscription Nabil, said to the French News Agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for the reason for three years to make this project acquainted and expressed his relief, that it now wins more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, use in agreement with the NGO Ghiras Alas the humanitarian Crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to get 125 families of knowledge to use mushrooms, as Dr. Leila related to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this writing, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around â¬12.700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo on Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is based on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of fuel shortages, locally produced fuel from plastics used to supply the energy generators.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of the fungal" from the regions, before they checked their quality and whether they are not suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Afterwards they planted a small fungus in a tub. when this worked they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have created a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms anywhere in East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 Brings</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capitals in Portugal and called justice for the victims of the fires that raced in the week before, in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two-two persons died and around 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireworks bursts that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, a similar tragedy happened, where the fires accounted for 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system that is monitored by satellite photos, in 2017 alone, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the greatness of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">The people asked why the civil protection had not been able to suspend the level of tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral stated by the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o streets and villages have been evacuated for everything and nothing evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria a similar tragedy happened again as in June, because the streets were very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, construction permits are covered in Ãrtlements with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">An extensive proposal on the forest form, which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle for investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government conducted a loosening of the law, if the applicant had a means for self protection - that was an open door, that everything could be built," "" "JoÃ£o Sorval continued in the same article from the newspaper PÃºblico." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made it aware that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly burning wood, itself, like in a vicious circle, continues to spread the fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal is on October 15th and 16th, when citizens sought information or tried to contact persons who was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was decisive in this fateful weekend in October, the servers that followed the fires that followed the fires, were unable to reverse the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In the fall of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years before, a fearless civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups who had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. in this way, Afghanistan had become a country of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party had just been murdered by the Taliban, and many Hazara suddenly felt protection.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban were always closer to support for their hatred against the Hazara well known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a cohedge. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left by his low wage, and went into Iran. once again, he once found himself in a strange country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself to make his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time like today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were coined by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf complained in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so we do not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous journey on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application in 2002, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf left homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that divided twice the day food to needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high watering quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions for asylum seekers are found in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights organisation of the Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system has been suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The great majority of the asylum seekers is housed in more than 3000 "special exhibition centres." there is an impromptu facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a admission center, when they officially put an application for asylum - which can go after the registration of asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Till then there are people who have no money for an accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there is also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his disobedient livelihood helped Asharaf to release himself soon from these conditions.</seg>
