this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
a long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA reportedly have illeg@@ ally listened to Americans .
but there is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , where the CIA knew Iran literally stri@@ pped into a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified R@@ isen and called it to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and condemn journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the Media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not receive this information , and if you cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ gs they give .
so , when the government had ank@@ ched R@@ isen , he did something , what many cour@@ ageous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though it was essential for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped by R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and springs are always less hiding .
instead of failure and scra@@ p to make statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , was concerned with his telephone numbers ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , credit information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and killed source , to condemn .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of its job than secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of having a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower became a journalist .
thus , we put the media work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional approach , because the government has more opportunities to spy out all .
but just like technology allowed the government to avoid repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and indeed , they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact , instead of falling , in Zeu@@ s .
today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source open source system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the web @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working on , has been developed further .
instead of opening an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , like that of the Washington Post .
you can also upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only has the respective news agency access .
so the government can no longer aid more information , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the out@@ set .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world evol@@ ves new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ angers us all dangerous .
it is certain to ensure that not only technology enthusiasts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to contribute ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we have to protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers and report by over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lint . or a Wall@@ st @-@ Insider , who warns us in front of the next financial crisis .
at least these technologies were not only done for those who want to uncover their crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thanks . thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest dat@@ le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and vali@@ ant &#93; &#91; enormous sum of money has been hidden for tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; this week we were asked by Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; this week we were sent from News about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s based Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get a impression how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you do that ? &quot;
we really see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very first direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dic@@ t@@ ators Bashar al @-@ Assad has ph@@ ased out @-@ up companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of kinder@@ gart@@ ens , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people and others who wait for the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ ROM .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as Healthcare , Education , Stre@@ ets .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all the world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide their assets and w@@ ailing -- something we have been discussing and be@@ ating for ten years .
I think many people will seem very conf@@ using to all this world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ oot .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there were no more prominent American citizens in these revel@@ ations caused by scandal in these revel@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American clients .
if we would have a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more inst@@ ances and examples that have connections in the US .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states it needs fewer information to specify less information to establish a company than to make a li@@ br@@ arian pass .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees to break down school children .
it has been allowed to scra@@ p particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behaviour that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent another investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African Minister , who wanted to bring susp@@ ects money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked us that all until a lawyer made suggestions to investig@@ ator , how he could be transferred to his money .
these were all pre@@ conception . none of these lawyers received us as clients , and of course no one has been handed over to the money . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as a single strike .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer , who has instructed investig@@ ating investig@@ ators .
it is not about a single leading pole , implic@@ it in a scandal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to overcome this , we need to change the rules .
we need to change rules to make this kind of behaviour .
this may sound very sore , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if it will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I definitely see that things have begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen su@@ pre@@ aches to greater transparency , affecting the owners of companies .
the issue found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is located in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge gli@@ mp@@ se into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind head@@ aches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end the kind of in@@ transparency by laws .
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apping and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a rear sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he got the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps but I do not know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
a voice in my head said : &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed into the ceiling , and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what happened to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a game of wild sleep in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , lock@@ ti@@ ly at the door , and lock my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art that he had bought from me is now in his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood are actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air@@ mattress was to host me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let us take a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate and the rent is raised .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it easy to transform in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment is equipped with a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN , and a desk inclusive , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests could have been able to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they thought it was great , and we too .
I am sure , our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different , because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we passed our last guest and the door dropped to the castle , Brian and I arrived .
had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website open to the people publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors are coming when visiting .
over the internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we warned that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
nobody who is yet at consol@@ ation would invest in a shop that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we are all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if one has a problem , one gets on the things you can do well . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the whole experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust in design imm@@ oral confidence , between people who never met before .
can design carry such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste , which degree of confidence we stri@@ pped .
it is a 30 second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your left mobile phone in your left sitting position .
this quiet an@@ flug from panic , which you feel now - -- is exactly what hosts you when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell phone of a foreig@@ ner in their hands ?
the majority feel the responsibility .
so most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only this is why our company can exist .
only so who has Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone now ?
could you tell Twitter that he is President of the President &apos;s Office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor should have imag@@ ined with his name , if he had told , where he comes , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 supporters who say : &quot; he can really keep it very well . &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ protected feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to prevent negative ass@@ essments .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were handed over to their ass@@ essments before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford , we examined how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how they are at age and residence .
little unexpected can we trust the people most , who are the most res@@ isti@@ ble .
the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ defined .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation sound from common@@ alities .
the right design , therefore , can help us overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell a little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get a reply .
he tells too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , -- -- the request is also not accepted .
there is therefore an optimal degree of op@@ enness , such as &quot; Great art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design , to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which issues you should write a little .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
which we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these pre@@ ju@@ dice .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first , very good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us , the business is just very good .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties , or have been rav@@ aged .
hosts have to stand guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front front , when trust has been broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than this calls . it &apos;s hur@@ ting if I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us .
fortunately , only a problem of 123 million suffer@@ ers had ever been a fraction .
because people trusted each other right to each other .
if Trust works , res@@ ett@@ lement arises .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is its assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who bow to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are true gu@@ ardian angel save one life , although they don &apos;t know it right .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want one to feel lon@@ ely , they pass books .
they even stay longer without charge without the extra @-@ nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way , of course , not every stay .
but those relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled on this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of participation with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about a economic trade .
but it just is just &quot; rental industry , &quot; it is not just the case .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
to compare these days , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would , however , if trips would be a generous buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill a group there and show a thor@@ ough and a bar again by which one has never heard ;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays homes are designed according to privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments for a reason ?
what would that look like ?
what would , if cities would accept the thought of shared share ?
I imagine towns and relationships , instead of sol@@ itude and amor@@ tis@@ ation .
South Korean capit@@ als Seoul has already begun this project . lots of parking that belonged to the government ,
were now offered for residents . students who were looking for a stay , were offered .
were convey@@ ed in people whose children were moved . there were incub@@ ator programmes started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy alone . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries at a foreig@@ ner or even hosts .
so the idea seems to be so crazy , as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality were there already before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has just our works ?
aside from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us to overcome , deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I must always think about it when a red Maz@@ da goes over to me .
we know of course that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great impact , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks . thank you .
what do you think , when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , a brain under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay in safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean , most people wouldn &apos;t know Muslims .
presumably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
to all those who have never met Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ller @-@ Fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to decide .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and opposite the pressure which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to fit me a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have entered with the Koran .
I read it , thought , thinking , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was no love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ ened the coral with each reading .
the beauty of rhythm takes me sometimes to weep .
I recognize myself therein . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and somehow loves ?
so it feels like that .
later , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the bottom of the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning arrived in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
in my kitchen , I sat in my kitchen , gaz@@ ed at the end , looked at the screen and looked the word &quot; Eil@@ notification . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people sp@@ ill out of buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard say ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed the works of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to go through the Central West of the USA to move into a new town and start with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I landed -- as we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to become the Muslim .
we moved into our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for the prayer .
once again the war@@ nings observed : &quot; do not go to this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting on me .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fortun@@ ate and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who have been for Muslims , the free breaks , and struck them .
there were really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country , attacked our country .
I over@@ turned the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain continuously .
I have nothing to ask , I love questions .
there are accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church , as by a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor only remains under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all the Americans , not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are inventor , teachers , fer@@ sth@@ eses and Olymp@@ ian risks .
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America be safer ?
perhaps there will be a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror .
regular visiting of a mosque is leading to people who toler@@ ate other faith and show greater citizenship .
and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
when the Radi@@ cal process is found that it starts online . as a result , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group is due to the IS its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as the Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations , if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you throw a look at them , they do not drive on what they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that it lets these things read in the Scrip@@ tures .
a memorable I@@ mam recently told me an amazing history :
a girl came to him , because she sat down to join the IS .
I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
nothing inspired by nothing and something that gave their heart , it was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alisation of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to be a solution .
this im@@ am turned the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their rage , he showed their construc@@ tive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
it was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect the normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day respond to our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study - actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show us : if we fear , you will pass at least three things .
we accept an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows that if one was reported to test individuals , in which negative about Muslims reported that they rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the m@@ oods against Muslims moved up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ run of the Iraq war and during two periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on a Muslim terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to explo@@ it the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear can harm us all .
with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about to explain herself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was promising in dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say that he was the most sweet , more generous people who knew her .
she visited him there , and showed her his CV . she was start@@ led and said ,
&quot; when did this young man have become a sealed young man from my breasts ? &quot;
only a few weeks after the Su@@ zanne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , she has been murdered , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in the execution , after having utter@@ ed against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ atism can not only be fatal , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
we talk about it and for us it was not a easy decision , because it was about what America we would leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can practice our religion freely .
we decided to the mosque .
with our son in children &apos;s seat , we went silent , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , letting me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank our guests , thanks to the half of the meetings were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us .
in that moment , I am broken together .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion on panic and pre@@ ju@@ dice .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose about the moment of fear and fan@@ atism ?
will you go to the number safe ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks a lot !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ ve .
but I wonder what do you say , that you may say that you are a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a memorial with deep @-@ depth thinking , thus an exception and not the rule are .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so ordinary as it is allowed .
when you look to Muslims around the world , and I did so with the largest possible study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity to family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m an exception in no regard .
if people like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , stands shortly before , to become a billi@@ on@@ aire .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for industrial d@@ ron@@ es . it is possible to work in research institutions around the world .
before the air takes place in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft presses in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting , air@@ equipment can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build up self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to deal with turbul@@ ence , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general to respond to natural laws .
today , we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight .
so that a system has been autonomous , it must know collec@@ tively , where space is located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras for finding objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available in highest flat@@ e. for example , &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other Star@@ r@@ hi@@ kers , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ches it can be floating , and thus it is great benefits at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a flip side .
a limitation of hed@@ ge@@ ants is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind b@@ uns .
we develop new tax measures and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air @-@ unit doesn &apos;t matter in what position will improve the optimal position and improve the performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that struggle to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question .
Hel@@ icop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which are different to get vulnerable to you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote control units , which had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a rear @-@ ru@@ der .
we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ate , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote @-@ served flight machine . it was invented recently .
it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no cl@@ aps , hing@@ es and rest@@ ors , no other actu@@ ators or controllers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move in the room .
nevertheless it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tail@@ or . to get it to flies , I have to throw it right correctly .
the probability of throwing it right correctly , if all of you see is slight , therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ ate is a exercise in toge@@ ther@@ ness , this machine is here , the Omni@@ pot@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is equivalent in his alignment .
thereby he receives the cau@@ ti@@ dy ability ,
moving in space to all directions , no matter what direction it is shot , or even as he rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight pro@@ pane .
a lot is available in models , the rest is learning directly at flying .
let &apos;s see that .
when flight machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this is in clock@@ wise direction
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics , or battery -- the machine can continue to fly when restricted .
we will demonstrate that by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration exam@@ ines synthetic heat .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ ri@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms .
every unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade would like to press a particularly safe machine .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the salary is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart t@@ apping to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
at 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes moved each other in a very far away , they turned the mass of three prob@@ es into pure energy .
this short moment , it lighted lighter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big bu@@ zz .
they put them not in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time structure and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
prior to 1.3 billion years ago there was just a multi @-@ cell living on earth .
since then , Earth has produced quite some : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God stand up in -- even the internet .
some 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ ageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver has decided to build a giant laser detector , that are caused by gravity waves to be found in black holes .
most kept them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a crazy genius so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer line Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly improved , which significantly improved its recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clari@@ fy some minor , stu@@ b@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes passed through the earth through .
they went through you and me
and through the detector itself .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ ken father .
basically we were the fruits of my life .
all this , what I worked for is not longer Science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ c in the sense of space and time .
when super@@ vis@@ ing the shaft , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and out into the other .
to illustr@@ ate , lecturer in courses lead to the theory of rel@@ ativity is often a righ@@ tist dance .
&quot; expan@@ se and du@@ sting , stret@@ ch@@ able and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves , and the strain of an average human was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one told the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear bomb exactly . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne described a co @-@ founder of L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such det@@ ectors are tremendous .
but physi@@ cists are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
the visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can manufacture one image or card of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you around .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore , it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean particularly much :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead , we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now , &quot; Alice is talking about . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob &quot; is written .
the same is for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in all .
but as we listen to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave pattern to sound , we can hear the all literally .
the gravity of gravity , however , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has already been busy .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , just ski@@ ps : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you hear the same Zir@@ pen with an additional sound change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u @-@ w@@ u !
it is a kind of movement @-@ set , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I should never forget it -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ der Sp@@ aces &#93; No one , who knows what he must listen to , recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turns around as quickly as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before .
on this path , we can listen to the noise and the invisible .
much in all we can not see -- practical or basically -- .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ager stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them all .
the exciting physical processes , however , occur in the core , which lies behind thousands kilometres of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves pass through iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the urine is going to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the urine is hidden through its own after@@ g@@ low .
it should be possible , using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we never saw , and of which we have no idea of . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o was in the first run things we did not expect .
my colleague in MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ raut dish for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o allows us to take a completely different angle to the events in all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately , how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than the reason to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks . thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
for one year I would be &quot; Yes ! &quot; in front of whom I was afraid .
whether it was nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I like to be on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to play with the rock ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I was afraid , removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah that changed my life on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for all &quot; sk@@ itt@@ ens &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons .
as she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak terrace . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the leap . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Ye@@ ah was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I am pregnant with them , always to play with them . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say always Yes -- each single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I make an effort very much .
it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; messages were saved to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things come from , get out of life .
dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I make TV .
I do TV , in big style .
I am responsible for this TV @-@ season to carry out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every show provides hundreds of jobs that previously weren &apos;t existed before .
the budget for a TV channel will be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode of every nine days with four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs , which are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series will run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I create myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ ese . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about bon@@ fires and my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that around the world burn .
do you know who that still does ?
nobody , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I tell you , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now a company , a country or a household , make me seriously when I say about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not only around on the computer , and it &apos;s true if I say : I understand that there is no dream about dreams .
everything is a job , all work , all reality , everything blood , all tail -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m in the job , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like I placed troops as painted on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so as dre@@ aming a high sound , you delivered a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , challenging and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and dis@@ rup@@ tive , genetically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on her .
many people assume , if I tell them the sum@@ s that I &apos;m talking about writing that the letter has been given to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began working with television production , began to work and work , build and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , that energy . the sum@@ s !
the tot@@ als is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you cannot be contrary to size .
the feeling , not to be different than to the size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
maybe it is the failure of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it in question .
to make one clear : the more successful I will , the more ship@@ ments , the more work there is , the more work there , the more I remember , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sw@@ am . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned down .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; bi@@ b , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
here are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s were heard .
the tot@@ als of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , performed weekend , no repent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what do you do when doing what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loc@@ ust yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the author of Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you are doing what you are doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the sum@@ s feels already , and knows how the sum@@ s knew the sum@@ s , if the sum@@ s stopped , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , I would be aware of two things :
first , I have to say Yes to everything and second , they did not call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
they don &apos;t call anybody more &quot; cookies . &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it if I am titanium , and my sum@@ s mour@@ ned , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we play and che@@ ating their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ s , can &apos;t do anything but to fit out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they do not exist anymore .
everything that exists , sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , tender voices , juni@@ per pins and the song in which there is letting go , or whatever the girl is in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working routine , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe my brain by programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not working .
it is dependent on joy .
the real sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the current one comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s is Self @-@ Consci@@ ousness and Peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to have done tasks , expectation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a regular rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of all guilt .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice but I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it was so easy . I &apos;m not good in play , I don &apos;t like it .
playing me not ans@@ at@@ as , how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at home than at home .
this confes@@ sion is painful , as for a man , rather than to be home ?
well yes , me .
be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of them is .
we are lying around and back in the garden , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I always check for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say ! they always say Yes when your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you &apos;ll keep me nai@@ ve for a day dre@@ aming .
there you are right , but you can also do it !
you have time !
and you also know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , up to them , that they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bugs or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs not need it .
everybody can upgrade for 15 minutes on a bad mood , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes on a piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children &apos;s bed ready .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my benef@@ ici@@ ties , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is true that sum@@ s feel to have a place for his soul @-@ peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I failed and I victories . friends meeting , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show , when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what could be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I &apos;m not working .
work does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . she has chann@@ eled me to new ideas . I use it in full outline and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s up ... not me anymore .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is my doll that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play .
and yet I have everything in the grip . my brain is still functioning . my bon@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the more fortun@@ ate I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the high sounds , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more it makes this unusual , lasting , naked , and new life @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things off , I aw@@ aked you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a dream job should be a bit more toler@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks a lot .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us Neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious bre@@ ach of the central nervous system , patients often have lasting , difficult disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions with various surgical interventions .
certainly they have heard from one of the most well known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimul@@ ation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered heavy trem@@ or and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional Neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time , I was a Senior Consult@@ ant and worked in the emergency department day and night .
I often supplied patients with brain trau@@ ma trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a the brain gets superior to the brain and the cran@@ ial @-@ pressure rises .
to save life , one must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes one has to remove a s@@ wollen cran@@ ial mass sometimes .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist that analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not a easy task .
it is comparable to small children , which are taken out of your families .
you need to find proper food , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François Hollande managed .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you are still aware of the biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but changed differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cell cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why don &apos;t they stay ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentrations of brain damage .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear - however , from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cells that cultiv@@ ate Jean @-@ François Hollande
and then mark them color , to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we im@@ planted it at the entrance examination of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks , they were completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we proce@@ eded to injury and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we coloured in vitro , in the culture .
we couldn &apos;t stop here .
can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained ap@@ es with a manual skill .
they had to take food pellets for a tablet .
they did so very well .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we spent the motor motor motor in motor Cort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands any more .
just as it would happen in people , it recovered spontane@@ ously until a certain degree , just like a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ er brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as in the ap@@ es .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys that re@@ covering spontane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial capacity from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimul@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting results too .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and later use .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still in the im@@ it@@ ant human being .
I really hope that I can show you soon , as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do this . &quot;
I definitely fall .
of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are , before starting clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms , in order to run this type of studies .
BG : it is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
afterwards one has to apply this to a multi @-@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it is certainly , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable bone .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably leading to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his major im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have known that it is quite possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact the democracy is we@@ aving to us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ miss@@ understand@@ able to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- won &apos;t affect the austerity schemes that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my in@@ cas@@ ual friends who would say to me that democracy was abolished when they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy .
I beg you , together with me again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake exist , we could save the democracy , but that we need a truly mis@@ sive democracy .
without democracy our societies are destroyed , our future is dark and our great , new technologies w@@ asted .
as a matter of w@@ ess , I want to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that is currently threatened by our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt berg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt berg ,
but few recognize his twin dy@@ mus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce the debt relief , and even all those things could produce mankind , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the US , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 trillion US dollars is like a lot of money until you ro@@ amed it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time around the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock ex@@ changes and the property prices are high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital forms the twin peaks , which are not compens@@ ated through the usual market mechanisms .
the outcome are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore , a low demand for investors , who would not invest in a final loss , could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally , the circumstances suggest that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
its extremely lav@@ atory art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives to further develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue , what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the company form , in which the free , and the poor as the majority of the government control .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many of them --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to imp@@ ose the vac@@ ancy value of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these conclusions .
the decisive question of the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy was and is that they gave the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial , which gave them the right to political participation in questions of the state bel@@ lied forces .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long before --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is burned quickly .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but at the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute of rule .
for the liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was carried into politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democra@@ t zone .
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time , in which these separation between politics and economy began , a her@@ edi@@ tary struggle between the two and the economy gradually under@@ took politics and escaped .
are you wonder@@ ing why politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not due to its DNA de@@ generation .
it is because you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not in power , because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of boot@@ legs , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which she feeds itself , dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that the policy has so far can@@ ni@@ ated that it grows through the self @-@ induced economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political assets are dischar@@ ged , ine@@ quality is increasing , and the managing director of the companies are anxi@@ ous to invest in cash of their enterprises .
the more successful &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from the democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; reserves , like in the ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and the foreig@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the new idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low profile workers through automation and robot .
the problem is that long economy and policies are separated , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon , as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we should democra@@ tically develop the re@@ unified area , otherwise we &apos;ll end the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements , which he has produced , survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is disturbed by a D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something that the company is in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or to put human energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the sense of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples in all of them .
in the company &apos;s area : please introduce a capital market that you earn money while you are working and in that your Capital will follow you from a workplace to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues are completely out@@ dated and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , which are not working there , and employees working there , but the company does not belong here . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately not emp@@ or@@ ated twin peaks .
in the field of global political economics , please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; and each government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country , into a joint fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have seen them , especially in the background of a restored policy and the economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ ist because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
are we awakening in such a world
or are we going to be in a &quot; Matrix &quot; - a similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we will decide politically .
it is in our hands , and we &apos;re doing it better .
thanks . thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian mar@@ xi@@ sten in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said relevant , Marx &apos;s relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , the technological development will create a massive decline in economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
also like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally dis@@ comfort .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG said in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Red@@ ner you have very clearly said what you think from the view of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have a democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain way , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- Do you remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historical .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what you can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now to gra@@ ze what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of ra@@ ging after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance ministers from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I warned that this happens .
BG : yes ...
how do you check back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the self @-@ pleasing , and the continued den@@ ial that a massive expansion line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to argue that the development of the whole European Union is massi@@ vely threatened .
we had the opportunity to be on the basis of Greek incident -- by the way , the first suggestion was to reveal this den@@ ial --
we have to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continue to den@@ ial the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries an economic system that is not self @-@ viable , can be obtained through political will and auth@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it might be delayed for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously aft ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a well @-@ called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake had been submitted to the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought there was an honest interest on pages of the investors obliged to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they only wanted to bring our government , only because they didn &apos;t wanted to deal with the dis@@ gra@@ d@@ ations caused by the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme for 5 years in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than the Great Depression . &quot;
none of the Tro@@ ika @-@ leg@@ islat@@ ure , who imposed us this policy , conf@@ essed to us : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ an error . &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you still seem to be quite a @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my critic@@ isms of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and love Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they don &apos;t survive , the jo@@ inted workers will be dam@@ aging the demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we beat ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will be well @-@ called for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re lying wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he probably is responsible for about 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
that &apos;s going back on the decision , the Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for creating shows and contents to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought sector .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
he must find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this turn .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ting where to get a s@@ quad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you already have special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does more thoughts about the average ex@@ ul@@ ence , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t inspire .
so he must ensure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so much , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to ris@@ ky anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts for an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online , where anyone can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon is free for free things , do you interv@@ ene , right ?
millions of spectators watched these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are watching at the viewing of these shows .
you will be watched by Roy and his team who record it all .
you record when you start the show , when you p@@ aus@@ ed what parts you ski@@ p or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they gather the data , process these and the answer , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com of four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it is only an average show - in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this bend is 7.4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
around the same time with another company has pl@@ az@@ ed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . exactly as Roy is always looking for this a super show and he uses data for it but he does something different .
instead of organis@@ ing a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed firms .
they connect these many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow says that all should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision that is ready , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optim@@ ised by very efficient computer .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , then it is a bit sc@@ ary because we are living in a time , in which we get more and more statistics , in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this space ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if anyone asks here in the United States in jail and for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be bad , but more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always created the best results . it does not mean that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data sub@@ ver@@ ted companies are also false .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that they can be fore@@ seen through data analysis of flu , grave species , and can be predicted - by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a news message . the success was cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked imp@@ ec@@ cable , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data are obvious in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the dispute , in medicine .
so , we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very wise people utili@@ ze un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some samples from the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a first disman@@ tle this problem in its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as second , you put together the individual parts to hold a decision .
sometimes you need to do this several times , but there are always two things : do apart and re@@ mot@@ ely .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have : our brain .
if there is something that is good for the brain , it is parts and pieces to put together , even if the information is incomplete , in order to express a good dis@@ miss@@ al -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
this is why , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they wouldn &apos;t have been able to capture all these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that is not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the contrary , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compete for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things will run wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and around that not to forget , this machine is fairly useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you must only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I &apos;ll get it out later with a tech@@ ing demo .
I have met some decisions in my life so far , I should have heard the ball in the night .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by a much more elabor@@ ate , such as data analysis to make better choices .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is smart@@ ly and smart@@ y and smart@@ y . ultimately , if we want to make decisions , if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying , make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing , and risks involved .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve .
thanks a lot .
