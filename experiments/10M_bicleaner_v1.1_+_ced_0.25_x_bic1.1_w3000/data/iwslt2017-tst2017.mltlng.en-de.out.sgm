<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">A long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA reportedly have illegally listened to Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter which should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, where the CIA knew Iran literally stripped into a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified Risen and called it to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblower and condemn journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the Media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media does not receive this information, and if you cannot protect the identity of the mugs they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government had ankched Risen, he did something, what many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though it was essential for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped by Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs are always less hiding.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and scrap to make statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his understanding, was concerned with his telephone numbers,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, credit information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and killed source, to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned more than all US governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of its job than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of having a whistleblower became a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus, we put the media work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional approach, because the government has more opportunities to spy out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology allowed the government to avoid reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they are able to contact them from the moment in which they contact, instead of falling, in Zeus.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that didn't exist yet, when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source open source system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the web-famous Aaron Swartz, which was today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working on, has been developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of opening an e-mail, go to a news site, like that of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only has the respective news agency access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer aid more information, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world evolves new espionage technologies that endangers us all dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is certain to ensure that not only technology enthusiasts such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to contribute iniquities. it is just as important that we have to protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about abuse during the supply of soldiers and report by overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallst-Insider, who warns us in front of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least these technologies were not only done for those who want to uncover their crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest datleck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and valiant] [enormous sum of money has been hidden for tax havens.] this week we were asked by Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] this week we were sent from News about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama's based Mosque Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get a impression how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you do that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We really see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very first direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian Dictators Bashar al-Assad has phased out-up companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it is claimed that a trace of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of kindergartens, a famous Cellists." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people and others who wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-ROM.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as Healthcare, Education, Streets.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all the world media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens of some few are used to hide their assets and wailing -- something we have been discussing and beating for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will seem very confusing to all this world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoshoot.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no more prominent American citizens in these revelations caused by scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not so that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosque Fonseca has less American clients.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we would have a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more instances and examples that have connections in the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states it needs fewer information to specify less information to establish a company than to make a librarian pass.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees to break down school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to scrap particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behaviour that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent another investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as an African Minister, who wanted to bring suspects money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that all until a lawyer made suggestions to investigator, how he could be transferred to his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preconception. none of these lawyers received us as clients, and of course no one has been handed over to the money. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as a single strike.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer, who has instructed investigating investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leading pole, implicit in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to overcome this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change rules to make this kind of behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sore, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if it will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I definitely see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen supreaches to greater transparency, affecting the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention through the British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is located in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a bill in parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge glimpse into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their real identity behind headaches.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy that arise and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to end the kind of intransparency by laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapping and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a rear sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He got the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace-corps but I do not know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said: "uh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was in bed, I stared into the ceiling, and thought," "" "Oh man! what happened to me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of wild sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, locktily at the door, and lock my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me is now in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood are actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my airmattress was to host me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate and the rent is raised.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it easy to transform in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment is equipped with a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN, and a desk inclusive, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests could have been able to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure, our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different, because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we passed our last guest and the door dropped to the castle, Brian and I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website open to the people publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind rooms whose doors are coming when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We warned that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is yet at consolation would invest in a shop that allowed strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we are all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If one has a problem, one gets on the things you can do well. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the whole experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust in design immoral confidence, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design carry such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste, which degree of confidence we stripped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your left mobile phone in your left sitting position.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet anflug from panic, which you feel now - -- is exactly what hosts you when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell phone of a foreigner in their hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">The majority feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only this is why our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so who has Al Gores's mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he is President of the President's Office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor should have imagined with his name, if he had told, where he comes, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 supporters who say: "he can really keep it very well."</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-protected feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to prevent negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were handed over to their assessments before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford, we examined how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how they are at age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little unexpected can we trust the people most, who are the most resistible.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less confidence we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predefined.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three convictions, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation sound from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design, therefore, can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you cost from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell a little, like "Hi!," you don't get a reply.</seg>
<seg id="189">He tells too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother, -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">There is therefore an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design, to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which issues you should write a little.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">Which we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, very good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed parties, or have been ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have to stand guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront front, when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than this calls. it's hurting if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a problem of 123 million sufferers had ever been a fraction.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other right to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If Trust works, resettlement arises.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is its assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who bow to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are true guardian angel save one life, although they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want one to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They even stay longer without charge without the extra-nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This way, of course, not every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But those relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled on this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of participation with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about a economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it just is just "rental industry," it is not just the case.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People are part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">To compare these days, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would, however, if trips would be a generous buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill a group there and show a thorough and a bar again by which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments for a reason?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would, if cities would accept the thought of shared share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine towns and relationships, instead of solitude and amortisation.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korean capitals Seoul has already begun this project. lots of parking that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered for residents. students who were looking for a stay, were offered.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveyed in people whose children were moved. there were incubator programmes started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy alone. over our platform alone, 785 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries at a foreigner or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy, as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality were there already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome, deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must always think about it when a red Mazda goes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great impact, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean, most people wouldn't know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">To all those who have never met Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möller-Fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to decide.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and opposite the pressure which I felt as 17-year-old to fit me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have entered with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, thinking, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was no love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion to deepened the coral with each reading.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm takes me sometimes to weep.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself therein. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later, I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the bottom of the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning arrived in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">In my kitchen, I sat in my kitchen, gazed at the end, looked at the screen and looked the word "Eilnotification."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people spill out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I changed the TV channel and heard say..." "" "Muslim terrorists..." ""... "in the name of Islam..." ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "..." ""... "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu transformed the works of others from a civil war into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to go through the Central West of the USA to move into a new town and start with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I landed -- as we went silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to become the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said," "" "Be vigilant," "" "Be vigilant" "", "" "" "Stay in well lit areas," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then there was Friday in that week -- the day where Muslims gather for the prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">Once again the warnings observed: "do not go to this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting on me.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfortunate and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who have been for Muslims, the free breaks, and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really branding on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country, attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I overturned the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain continuously.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church, as by a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor only remains under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all the Americans, not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor, teachers, ferstheses and Olympian risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque is leading to people who tolerate other faith and show greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When the Radical process is found that it starts online. as a result, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and anyone who abhor their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group is due to the IS its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations, if you recognize them as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you throw a look at them, they do not drive on what they are" "" "the Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that it lets these things read in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A memorable Imam recently told me an amazing history:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she sat down to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by nothing and something that gave their heart, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation of extremists who promised to be a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam turned the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their rage, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect the normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day respond to our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study - actually several neuroscientific studies -- show us: if we fear, you will pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept an authoritarian government system, conformance and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if one was reported to test individuals, in which negative about Muslims reported that they rather have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the moods against Muslims moved up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-run of the Iraq war and during two periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on a Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to exploit the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear can harm us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about to explain herself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was promising in dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say that he was the most sweet, more generous people who knew her.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there, and showed her his CV. she was startled and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did this young man have become a sealed young man from my breasts?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, she has been murdered, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in the execution, after having uttered against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatism can not only be fatal, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We talk about it and for us it was not a easy decision, because it was about what America we would leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can practice our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in children's seat, we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw, letting me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thank our guests, thanks to the half of the meetings were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment, I am broken together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion on panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose about the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go to the number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks a lot!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say, that you may say that you are a TEDTalk to work a memorial with deep-depth thinking, thus an exception and not the rule are.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am so ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look to Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest possible study on Muslims around the world, people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity to family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm an exception in no regard.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, stands shortly before, to become a billionaire.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for industrial drones. it is possible to work in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before the air takes place in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft presses in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago she began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, airequipment can reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build up self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to deal with turbulence, deal with turbulence and in general to respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today, we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system has been autonomous, it must know collectively, where space is located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras for finding objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available in highest flate. for example, "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrhikers, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starches it can be floating, and thus it is great benefits at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedgeants is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind buns.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new tax measures and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air-unit doesn't matter in what position will improve the optimal position and improve the performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that struggle to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which are different to get vulnerable to you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote control units, which had only two moving parts: one propeller and a rear-ruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospate, the mechanically simplest remote-served flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No claps, hinges and restors, no other actuators or controllers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tailor. to get it to flies, I have to throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right correctly, if all of you see is slight, therefore I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospate is a exercise in togetherness, this machine is here, the Omnipotter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is equivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the cautidy ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space to all directions, no matter what direction it is shot, or even as he rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propane.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest is learning directly at flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flight machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, electronics, or battery -- the machine can continue to fly when restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadricopter -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Broadway a flying lampshade would like to press a particularly safe machine.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the salary is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart tapping to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">At 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes moved each other in a very far away, they turned the mass of three probes into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment, it lighted lighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big buzz.</seg>
<seg id="472">They put them not in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally, we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time structure and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Prior to 1.3 billion years ago there was just a multi-cell living on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, Earth has produced quite some: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand up in -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Some 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever has decided to build a giant laser detector, that are caused by gravity waves to be found in black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a crazy genius so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer line Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was significantly improved, which significantly improved its recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collized black holes passed through the earth through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector itself.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my token father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically we were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, what I worked for is not longer Science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a croc in the sense of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When supervising the shaft, the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and out into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturer in courses lead to the theory of relativity is often a rightist dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"expanse and dusting, stretchable and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched out at the meeting of the waves, and the strain of an average human was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one told the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear bomb exactly. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne described a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">The visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can manufacture one image or card of things by perceiving the light around you around.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore, it is very difficult to produce a picture of things that mean particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain properties such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now," Alice is talking about. "</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob" is written.</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But as we listen to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern to sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity, however, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has already been busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, just skips: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you hear the same Zirpen with an additional sound change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-set, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I should never forget it -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender Spaces] No one, who knows what he must listen to, recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which turns around as quickly as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the noise and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can not see -- practical or basically --.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massager stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, occur in the core, which lies behind thousands kilometres of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves pass through iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the urine is going to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the urine is hidden through its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible, using gravitation waves, back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we never saw, and of which we have no idea of. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo was in the first run things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague in MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the Saurierkraut dish for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo allows us to take a completely different angle to the events in all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately, how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the reason to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">For one year I would be "Yes!" in front of whom I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it was nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I like to be on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to play with the rock?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I was afraid, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yeah that changed my life on an unexpected art. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for all "skittens" for inexplicable reasons.</seg>
<seg id="570">As she would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak terrace."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her when I was on the leap. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yeah was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I am pregnant with them, always to play with them. no matter what I'm doing, or whither I go, I say always Yes -- each single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I make an effort very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" messages were saved to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things come from, get out of life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No, no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I make TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do TV, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">I am responsible for this TV-season to carry out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show provides hundreds of jobs that previously weren't existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a TV channel will be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode of every nine days with four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs, which are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series will run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts, which I create myself, and not only produced, so still obese. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans about bonfires and my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still does?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell you, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are now a company, a country or a household, make me seriously when I say about work, so you understand that I'm not only around on the computer, and it's true if I say: I understand that there is no dream about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">Everything is a job, all work, all reality, everything blood, all tail -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm in the job, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"" "" "" "it is like I placed troops as painted on a canvas." ""</seg>
<seg id="608">So as dreaming a high sound, you delivered a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, challenging and intoxicating, funny and disruptive, genetically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begin in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume, if I tell them the sums that I'm talking about writing that the letter has been given to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working with television production, began to work and work, build and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, that energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The totals is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you cannot be contrary to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different than to the size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the failure of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I will, the more shipments, the more work there is, the more work there, the more I remember, the more I write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swam. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned down.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "bib, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">Here are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, performed weekend, no repentance, nothing delegating, a titanium does not sleep, doesn't give up, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when doing what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some might think:" "" "locust yourself," "" "the author of Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you are doing what you are doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the sums feels already, and knows how the sums knew the sums, if the sums stopped, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States" waitress "poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, I would be aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say Yes to everything and second, they did not call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">They don't call anybody more "cookies."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it if I am titanium, and my sums mourned, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and cheating their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of sums, can't do anything but to fit out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they do not exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists, sticky finger and humid kisses, tender voices, juniper pins and the song in which there is letting go, or whatever the girl is in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working routine, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe my brain by programs and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not working.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the current one comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is Self-Consciousness and Peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignores the pressure of history, which are to have done tasks, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a regular rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of all guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice but I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it was so easy. I'm not good in play, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing me not ansatas, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This confession is painful, as for a man, rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, me.</seg>
<seg id="728">Be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are lying around and back in the garden, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always check for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say! they always say Yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you'll keep me naive for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are right, but you can also do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you also know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, up to them, that they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybugs or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can upgrade for 15 minutes on a bad mood, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children's bed ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my beneficities, my world. they don't have to be the children. it is true that sums feel to have a place for his soul-peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I failed and I victories. friends meeting, reading books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show, when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to surpass more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece, why not indulge in 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What could be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. she has channeled me to new ideas. I use it in full outline and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums that sums up... not me anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is my doll that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and to play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in the grip. my brain is still functioning. my bonfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the more fortunate I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the high sounds, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more it makes this unusual, lasting, naked, and new life-feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things off, I awaked you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That's the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">"" "" "" "for a dream job should be a bit more tolerate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and to play." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans don't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us Neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious breach of the central nervous system, patients often have lasting, difficult disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions with various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard from one of the most well known, the "deep-brain stimulation." it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered heavy tremor and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional Neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time, I was a Senior Consultant and worked in the emergency department day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with brain trauma trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at skull-brain traumata the brain gets superior to the brain and the cranial-pressure rises.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, one must decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes one has to remove a swollen cranial mass sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist that analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not a easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">It is comparable to small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find proper food, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François Hollande managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but changed differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum cell cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why don't they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are participating in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations of brain damage.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear - however, from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non-linguistic area and then cells that cultivate Jean-François Hollande</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color, to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we implanted it at the entrance examination of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks, they were completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we proceeded to injury and reimplanted the same cells, and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we coloured in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets for a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we spent the motor motor motor in motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hands any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, it recovered spontaneously until a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastier brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as in the apes.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial capacity from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting results too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still in the imitant human being.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon, as the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know somebody who can do this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely fall.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are, before starting clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms, in order to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- You have completed research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Afterwards one has to apply this to a multi-center study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certainly, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable bone.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing have known that it is quite possible to have a flowering capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact the democracy is weaving to us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmissunderstandable to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- won't affect the austerity schemes that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my incasual friends who would say to me that democracy was abolished when they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to present you an economical model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I beg you, together with me again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake exist, we could save the democracy, but that we need a truly missive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our societies are destroyed, our future is dark and our great, new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">As a matter of wess, I want to point to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt berg who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt berg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce the debt relief, and even all those things could produce mankind, for example" "" "green" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the US, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "3.4 trillion US dollars is like a lot of money until you roamed it with the 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars that were at the same time around the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchanges and the property prices are high." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital forms the twin peaks, which are not compensated through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The outcome are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore, a low demand for investors, who would not invest in a final loss, could be true that his son would kill him if he is growing,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally, the circumstances suggest that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely lavatory art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives to further develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue, what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the company form, in which the free, and the poor as the majority of the government control.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to impose the vacancy value of the athenian democracy due to these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive question of the athenish democracy was and is that they gave the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial, which gave them the right to political participation in questions of the state bellied forces.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long before --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is burned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But at the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute of rule.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was carried into politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- was a democrat zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time, in which these separation between politics and economy began, a hereditary struggle between the two and the economy gradually undertook politics and escaped.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to its DNA degeneration.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government nowadays, and yet not in power, because the power from politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's like a herd of bootlegs, which so sustainably the animals, of which she feeds itself, decimated, that she is starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that the policy has so far canniated that it grows through the self-induced economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political assets are discharged, inequality is increasing, and the managing director of the companies are anxious to invest in cash of their enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful "demos" [the people] from the democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the policy and the economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" reserves, like in the ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and the foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="950">"" "" "" "this is not the new idea." ""</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not particularly good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low profile workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that long economy and policies are separated, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon, as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "we need to reshape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we should democratically develop the reunified area, otherwise we'll end the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements, which he has produced, survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is disturbed by a Dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or by something that the company is in "Star Trek," or to put human energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -such utopia instead of the "matrix" similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples in all of them.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the company's area: please introduce a capital market that you earn money while you are working and in that your Capital will follow you from a workplace to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues are completely outdated and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, which are not working there, and employees working there, but the company does not belong here. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and donors, and ultimately not emporated twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economics, please indicate that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries].</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" and each government is paying the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country, into a joint fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have seen them, especially in the background of a restored policy and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberally, in which they privileged persons, and marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to be in a "Matrix" - a similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we will decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we're doing it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertarian marxisten in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said relevant, Marx's relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, the technological development will create a massive decline in economic demand that Larry Summers is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Also like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm totally discomfort.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG said in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of Redner you have very clearly said what you think from the view of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy on politics during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- Do you remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historical.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now to graze what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of raging after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I warned that this happens.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you check back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the self-pleasing, and the continued denial that a massive expansion line went through the eurozone, and continues to argue that the development of the whole European Union is massively threatened.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity to be on the basis of Greek incident -- by the way, the first suggestion was to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">We have to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to denial the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries an economic system that is not self-viable, can be obtained through political will and authitarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but if the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously aft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a well-called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake had been submitted to the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought there was an honest interest on pages of the investors obliged to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government, only because they didn't wanted to deal with the disgradations caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic programme for 5 years in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika-legislature, who imposed us this policy, confessed to us: "that was a colossalan error."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tons of talks, you still seem to be quite a-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticisms of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and love Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they don't survive, the jointed workers will be damaging the demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we beat ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will be well-called for the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're lying wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he probably is responsible for about 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back on the decision, the Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for creating shows and contents to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this turn.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicting where to get a squadron, your brain asks: "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows as "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you already have special intelligence to undergo" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He does more thoughts about the average exulence, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing so much, that's why Roy Price wants to risky anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects for an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online, where anyone can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is free for free things, do you intervene, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watched these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are watching at the viewing of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watched by Roy and his team who record it all.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you paused what parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they gather the data, process these and the answer, and this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom of four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many of them can remember this show, because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show - in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this bend is 7.4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Around the same time with another company has plazed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. exactly as Roy is always looking for this a super show and he uses data for it but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organising a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went into a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom via four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that all should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision that is ready, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very efficient computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work so, then it is a bit scary because we are living in a time, in which we get more and more statistics, in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this space ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If anyone asks here in the United States in jail and for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be bad, but more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always created the best results. it does not mean that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data subverted companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that they can be foreseen through data analysis of flu, grave species, and can be predicted - by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a news message. the success was culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked impeccable, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the journal Nature. "</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data are obvious in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the dispute, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very wise people utilize unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some samples from the difference between successful decisions on the basis of data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first dismantle this problem in its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as second, you put together the individual parts to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you need to do this several times, but there are always two things: do apart and remotely.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good for the brain, it is parts and pieces to put together, even if the information is incomplete, in order to express a good dismissal -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">This is why, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they wouldn't have been able to capture all these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the contrary, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they compete for TV ideas than they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things will run wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and around that not to forget, this machine is fairly useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball," it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you must only shake the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it out later with a teching demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have met some decisions in my life so far, I should have heard the ball in the night.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by a much more elaborate, such as data analysis to make better choices.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is smartly and smarty and smarty. ultimately, if we want to make decisions, if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still paying, make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing, and risks involved.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks a lot.</seg>
