Munich , 1856 : four maps that change your view into the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths should meet young people today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now being dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
mini@@ gar@@ den@@ ers generate the hard@@ est reason of farmers .
the oldest official card of Mün@@ ch promotes exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not currently available .
everyone knows that it had to be exciting , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ pping road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are everything else than current - but is therefore very impressive .
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
it became clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is an Flick@@ r carpet , which one can &apos;t recognize as such .
for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called certificates , and so @-@ called certificates .
these were created according to the Bavarian regulations between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
since spring 1800 , the French forces occupied Bavaria with Austria , during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course with military purposes .
finally , when the French troops finally moved from Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a country@@ wide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st@@ Max IV . Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and hence the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ y Management &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pri@@ mary data sheet of Munich comes from 1856 and is available as all others on the Bavarian State library .
the comparison of fruit / today is the most impressive state of the state .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is the sub @-@ type , which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map of the map , in 1877 , as the Munich district .
today , the bu@@ st@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of the buildings are located around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is located , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in zoom , a small @-@ piece map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten notes from the so @-@ called &quot; primitive &quot; derived from which the base tax was derived .
there are only little plots there today , but farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is characterised by the sub @-@ send@@ ling north .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the October festival , was actually still a meadow , and was not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the draft peri@@ odi@@ cal , one reads not only the road name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or by the An@@ höhe &quot; on the lu@@ sts &quot; - but also in the big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field street , one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the establishment of the psychiat@@ rist who is brought to King Ludwi@@ gs II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so @-@ called Irish .
in addition , he has prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients , first place was out , and it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the recycling plant in Hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
now on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people meet in Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , moved into a youth home with training .
the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of the houses of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; built in an architectural monument to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ ies , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allied Forces took many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses , and a se@@ wer &apos;s chapel of the Middle Ages were once located on the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are the preparations for the second S @-@ Bahn tri@@ cycle on 5 April 2017 .
with the shooting @-@ ler , the old Munich map can be compared with the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri
the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ ming has exhibited a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks in the state after Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri , which should come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of du@@ bi@@ ous , racial @-@ based accidents occur in the entire state and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently passed law of Missouri , which makes people harder to gain Dis@@ crimin@@ ality , as well as the law en@@ forcement agencies of the state , which are disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate the group , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of civil rights , which happen to humans .
they are attacked because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under un@@ question@@ able circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the State of Missouri , and was accused of being accused of being accused of a crime .
the Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by the Office of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the people must be ready to bring Cau@@ ca@@ ine or its relatives to travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Missouri was recorded in the year 2015 100 Hass@@ elt , after the latest figures from the Hass@@ elt &apos;s report of the FBI , which regul@@ ates the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use companies because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona , after the States have adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration inf@@ lic@@ ences , which will contribute to the development of AC@@ L@@ U for further filing .
travel war@@ nings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately , stakeholders have deployed the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States .
the subtle project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU out of the CDU White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac were a picture of a picture taken on @-@ site .
at the rect@@ angle of the family Sch@@ wen@@ demann , representatives of the fishing b@@ acher gathered together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann best@@ ows first insight into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative marketing course for milk of his cows , as Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
in the table of the Feri@@ a @-@ stalli@@ ons only regional .
as he is also called the BL@@ HV @-@ chair of Fis@@ bach , he described the fence as &quot; elementary @-@ important . &quot;
I can &apos;t profit up on so steep surfaces .
the green area care for much work , much needs to be edited with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ demann emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ong@@ ated operation and used the management of this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not lead bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the meaning of the dec@@ eption project and is happy about the leader of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leader &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers had to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
we hope that the or@@ ying of the areas could be moved quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sized the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often standing in criticism for the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the surface area is thus 40 hectares , which are not permitted until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total costs of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader , a quarter brought to the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
consequently the farmers had to invest 12 billion euros that had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and country@@ men it does not go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also for Peter White stand : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the policy @-@ care policy ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of women f@@ ences .
the goal is the closure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r drawn conveyor track .
moreover , the un@@ heated area may not be bad ( slopes over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened with confidence .
for the fis@@ cher@@ ish crossover project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the surface area covers 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing holy anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking off the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it , when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciated this as well as any other - hence the sort of staged fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Fir@@ m place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regim@@ es , certainly knew what he did when he took an ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposals of the President to dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have caught him if he had done it .
but he attacked their importance , and especially the meaning that you was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ aining : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go back to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... an American freedom that sh@@ ines the world .
the poem , which you refer to , added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on Lazarus , the only ones where a state does not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your troubles , your poor , and your supp@@ ressed masses which are looking for free to breathe freely , and the w@@ ishing tr@@ ash of your rich coast . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ uman USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who used to make their words after their death at the base - knew quite well that they have completed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republi@@ cans in making them a classic representation of the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and they are themselves a different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a disast@@ rous attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change it long from the right wing .
the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not united , but rather an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative , who bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; lady Liberty goes ahead .
it should carry out the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch shall not shine the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is tos@@ sed here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the view@@ point of perception .
the great terri@@ fic fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the true sense , to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you must hear .
and this is obviously not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wanted to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but hatred that is their only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world championship 2017 : Neil Black the Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle , remember a time when only two Schot@@ t belonged to the UK team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; United Kingdom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent of world championship plays a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes will be selected for London in 2017 , starting Friday .
black believes that &quot; Scotland has developed something special in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we &apos;ll continue to run until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ine , who can compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle from the team became a team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
her capitalist speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling of course , the E@@ ili@@ ie , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver med@@ alists , who will compete in their fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 Schot@@ t are in the British team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were met in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distances , Mu@@ ir , leads to five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should watch for a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Doyle re@@ members her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was at the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the national capit@@ alists say they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases , also at medals and the fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so special to be team capit@@ als that it was voted by the other members of the team , so it was anyway great honor to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and voted for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added to something completely special for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the gravel who belong to the team .
it just shows how far we came .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to poets .
what my speech as cap@@ tains concerned ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is , therefore , really important to put on this home support and profit that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete there , and there will be just such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block by critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office when you do not wear the dial @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from the Domestic Policy to its political principles .
he im@@ ams in criticism , for sure .
but he has not put his critics to silence .
for the year 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id@@ ly and dum@@ b we become like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
it brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an who has to work on it more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted , which expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained of it this week .
the staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ action with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest ranking of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary he@@ at@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and deb@@ ating his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come on the page of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan@@ s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse comm@@ ended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ ut or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ ent people who sw@@ inging the whi@@ p online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful , and not prof@@ ane .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
lawyer &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not satisfied , but she asked to hate speech .
&quot; I told pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment on the news show &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people responded to the same subject , they are considered as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees of the Govern@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ Attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut off a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect , burn , burn , burn papers or prot@@ esters to silence and to silence them .
but this just happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public civil servants who is critici@@ zed for his Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors , the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the first Am@@ end@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Judge , James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is , in Alexandria , appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time , Washington had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers had been varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat down his guidance .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions .
petitions which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents produced by the George Washington Project .
but he has not put it into silence .
freedom of expression , opinion , and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
the former Europeans n ° 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort because the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an is hosting the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the end of the past year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales before he lost against Paul E@@ ales and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the Club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his praise with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he made this place .
he is an eager advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great window for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because she won her in the year after being taken out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday , comes back to the promotion in the promotion of his 50th birthday .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more if you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel this additional pressure too .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid Golf .
I &apos;m happy about how it went so far . &quot;
with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are one of the six Schot@@ t on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
admission is free of charge , the parking costs £ 5 per car with one insert and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades less people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer occur in passi@@ v@@ smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the school director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he moved his own study on this issue of 1994 .
there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
Haus@@ en@@ closures prove itself as a very complex
construction in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; reas@@ onably complete in time , &quot; thus the head of the company Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the field of house connections , the situation is more complex than suspected , as in the underground , there is much nar@@ rated , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which is always disabled once again , represents a major problem for the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers in front of red lights and lock@@ out is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed , and only the line buses are eligible to drive .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she does not use a stove .
they even rarely use a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai reg@@ ain in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a . &quot; directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the stolen tu@@ bers will be taken with jeal@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and closed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where it carries out their daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course there may be too late to work : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking - and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one is dar@@ ing to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the Hig@@ hl@@ ands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia than only 1,0@@ 26 elders had to vote against the occupation forces .
an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , rapidly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ances .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , and the independent part of Papua New Guinea were eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as se@@ clu@@ ded as it deser@@ ts . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the town , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wood houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated shells , converted by r@@ ust in different yellow tones .
only very few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , fo@@ stering journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , dark shirts and its bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst mortality rate in Asia .
but Indonesia is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable gold@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a Hoch@@ land@@ provincial town in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua resources has an estimated 78 billion US dollar .
this wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s mighty military preser@@ ves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a study conducted by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort Local members had paid almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer .
pap@@ u@@ anian demands for larger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped by the Indonesian army since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe in the 1970s were according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for Com@@ mit Gen@@ ocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the past year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we understand everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is written in a report by the year 2016 in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year include , such as illegal Hin@@ ds and torture - rape and ra@@ des are especially popular according to another report - and brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to number the number of victims since each week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensi@@ fied , because pap@@ u@@ as resources re@@ produce a stream of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is Christian to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes that Muslim Economic mig@@ rant from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning @-@ ch@@ urch@@ ins sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local coast , A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ native , who moved to work in the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it cost the native Papua @-@ m@@ um m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua and its market . &quot;
the ind@@ on@@ ese President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 , promised the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations of Papua .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua , including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Zealand has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered a deep sleep for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fires in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the terri@@ fied children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued the group with their def@@ ences , their sacrifices and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers fired in the group &apos;s group .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so difficult that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building was set on fire near the Inter@@ governmental Commission and the things escal@@ ated next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ oni@@ ally hunting hun@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ tal@@ low - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago stem .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the mood has been heated , the soldiers were sent via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says TIM@@ E , which has not been released to local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot myself into my left hand joint , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame knows not yet , who is fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , his cousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; I ran to him , and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries a name as many Indon@@ esians , the TIM@@ E in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
the che@@ ers spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers wanted to ass@@ ure their station only &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings occurred only on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he utter@@ ed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims , and swore to address the historical abuse in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Marc Wir@@ anto &apos;s Safety Minister said in October 2016 that he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling both historic human rights violations .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ation began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have obliged to address these violations , but there are processes running through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke at the age of 5 in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , which charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; which requested more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already enclosed in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai Vor@@ um .
families of the P@@ ani@@ ai victims took us contrary to un@@ adulter@@ ated un@@ believers .
&quot; I interviewed four times during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he lives in fear for years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the opinion that people in P@@ ani@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , having helped four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting paintings are not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired up the vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction worker , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man who was 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
out@@ set vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police told that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by warning the warning .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ on@@ ese param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that it is ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured ones were delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to move the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an in@@ scri@@ bed for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family @-@ affiliated Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by pushing out spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the Top O@@ PM leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to the recent years , thousands of people were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken into custody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; ensuring national sovereignty . &quot;
some people will never appear again .
among the people in Papua is P@@ ani@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is the same except range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they reserve the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold out on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous ethnic and the new migrants have grown , which since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the airport of Nab@@ ire in a larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better trained and weal@@ thy migrants .
Papua will rarely have capital or the necessary abilities to lead their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of P@@ ani@@ ai .
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions in coverage left international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development , did not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa extension and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific countries called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ al@@ Islands and the Salom@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the P@@ ani@@ ai sli@@ ps .
the same countries are historically supported by the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said repor@@ ters in Jak@@ arta : &quot; Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to conce@@ de the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people want to know that more foreign governments will be aware of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited under the direction of the Human Right @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence on May 4th and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also took part in the session but anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua will say that they probably won &apos;t be right for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is involved in people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants the Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the permanent threat of a customs of military , is located in poor educational and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , have to consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; debt &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want only justice , &quot; he says .
in spite of the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ings , families of the P@@ ani@@ ai scra@@ ps brought the last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly to the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least let them not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire domin@@ ate the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest resi@@ dences of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents , from 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings to flee .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps into the high @-@ rise in just two years , reflecting the tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood at the fire alarm and when the cry of the people stood up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down to the bottom , &quot; a residents told his name as George , Reuters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil defence authorities said that units of the fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the buildings stopped .
the government said they work in the provision of accommodations for the victims .
the incident may cause questions about safety of materials that are used in outer areas of high @-@ rise buildings across the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building , after its fire in 2015 , revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the covering , the out@@ cl@@ adding to decoration or isolation , came .
in Great Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates to be insul@@ ating and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June became the rapid spread of a fire in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the president of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is pleased with his big Davis Cup @-@ cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Minh City meeting , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning sets , Hau@@ ch@@ afer is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics will remain the tradition@@ alist opposite .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the objective of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the values .
even after the vote , after many insights had before the proposal , the final on a neutral place was to be submitted .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup will be the host to host the host in the first round of the year .
in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ ers , the requirements for training places are reli@@ eved , etc . players will need to complete the Davis Cup less official media dates .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers make prohibited items into the aer@@ op@@ lane , finding out a survey
a survey among flying passengers showed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration pass over , among them at least 6 per cent who entered the plane while they were acci@@ dentally banned kni@@ fes or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late , that they had traveled ir@@ repar@@ ably with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ tered @-@ Service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that the younger trav@@ ellers rather viol@@ ate the rules .
of the respondents agreed that they attempted to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent Millennium Go@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of the Generation X .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said they were borne out by security control by security control , whereas in 2.2 percent of the female respondents , and 3.7 percent of the male respondents had confirmed that they were inten@@ tionally related drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it was questioned about trav@@ ellers in all the country to find out how many acci@@ dental s@@ mu@@ g@@ ums were brought through the airport safety and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that people who do most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA direc@@ tives are quite complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain which liquids may take them , or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of the troops captured by T@@ SA are forbidden for liquids .
for a while , people think T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ia .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care about tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s customers .
electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ min@@ ed that part of the customers have returned their un@@ warran@@ ted reservation .
in addition to the triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic reduction targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k met for the first time a different , less gl@@ ancing scale : the cancellation of the new mass market @-@ model 3 will be revealed for the first time .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k had often advertis@@ ed more than 500.000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition starts .
now , Mus@@ k dreamed : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have always noted that it is only an un@@ warran@@ ted reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
currently 45@@ 5,000 such un@@ binding reservations pre @-@ admitted , Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem , however , the Tesla boss believes not .
his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production site .
the past year Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models should be gathered - 500,000 will be a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates , its brand new , never before running in practice tested production lines with maximum capacity utili@@ zation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the un@@ binding of reservations should become a problem for Tesla .
after that , the company can &apos;t hin@@ der our satisfied customers , run away in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt draws to reducing the rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , gave his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ caused air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency proved to meet the needs of government agencies on re@@ action faster than previous administration .
he did not mention the complaint against his previous position at a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which ran on 1 October for states to hold the standards of 2015 for bottom zone o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time to become more reliable than strict environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been re@@ acted to block Reg@@ ulations , to which chemical industry and fossil fuels have resi@@ sted .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA publisher has exceeded his authority , as he tried to implement the Obama administration , oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane sho@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt carried out that his turn @-@ around for o@@ zone standards are quite simply the read@@ iness of EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of the tim@@ ely fulfilling of the new standards .
&quot; under earlier administration the EPA often passed the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then to be charged , by activists and others to establish an agreement , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it was said that P@@ ru@@ itt claimed his &quot; satisfaction to delay and all other legally available subject matter &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a final month of approval will give the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been set to vote in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - after our cl@@ auses - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorker , and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ ine , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is formed if pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to the sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems with sensitive groups of people , and also contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists cont@@ ested the exchange of exchange for P@@ ru@@ itts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wor@@ r@@ ying , how much pressure needed to make this reasonable step by the responsible step for the protection of the air that we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to fight against environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant off this powerful place .
the salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Martin@@ i stressed : &quot; it is a unique gri@@ ev@@ ous small od . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ c@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ischer Lloyd Book , Count Hermann of Sul@@ z and the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the Word , after standing on the Tum@@ linger mountain , apart from the Par@@ ish Par@@ ish Church , a gorgeous courtyard , too , belonged to the church or patron was not vice versa .
so there were people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , along with the Lower Village and the Ober@@ dorf , who today are still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the man@@ orial settlement center of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 signat@@ ories these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right arose from the early medieval suit@@ ability .
one Lord , who built a church , remained with a priest , and remained with a priest , and was able to inherit it .
this was the right to use a priest or bishop of a new parish .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church , two bells on the tower .
the bigger the two collapsed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell appeared in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released after the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were st@@ ew@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was very dense .
in 1796 , French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ war@@ es out and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to t@@ opp@@ le 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ figer @-@ Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from listening to Hör@@ mann .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ her church was demolished .
only the bell tower left .
in the New Year of the year 1834 , a storm split the storm and half crashed .
in order to prevent a disaster , the tower was demolished .
only today , the turbul@@ ent tower remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pension@@ ers &quot; as a successor by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as a host invite friends and sponsors of Tum@@ bl@@ ingen on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
designed by the com@@ bo of Kepler High School in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
for example , the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers make the fantastic views out .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters to the ob@@ taining of the historic St. Hil@@ aire plant , which is important for Tum@@ lingen and Hör@@ s@@ wis@@ s .
the friends and pat@@ rons feel particularly committed to the homeland , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ med .
Society intends to examine permission of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim restra@@ ined itself &quot; sees no legal requirement for building and has therefore turned into the Land@@ rat .
the club &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; denied with &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has encouraged its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of the approval on December 30 , 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at that time in Vier@@ sen only existed on the city limit to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind force concentration zone .
within this concentration area , construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration @-@ zones causes a exclusion of wind energy support for the rest of the urban area .
such zones are to prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
although the town of Vier@@ sen had a second wind force concentration in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette a few days earlier - which however did not allow the district government Düsseldorf , because of a formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of approval is the required approval decision , as before un@@ lawful and therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : the city council recently decided the wind@@ concentration @-@ zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit from the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the site of the creation of the creation of wind energy facilities scheduled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of re@@ petition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant writing have arrived in the district square since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them for the occasion to re@@ prove the matter again .
however , they do not expect that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of ongoing processes in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday was not going to appeal to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company in which the City of Vier@@ sen has been involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , was concluded with its owner of approximately 65 hectares of large land .
with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the power demand of around 11 400 households can be covered , which is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity demand for all four @-@ grown households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Four@@ sens urban re@@ signed a green light for buying three wind turbines at the wind farm Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
Auto and tractor scra@@ pers together : woman dies in aw@@ ful accident
one horri@@ ble traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Dutch gel@@ ach and Bo@@ w ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis district ) .
a woman was wounded and wounded .
two more people were injured .
the state road was closed over hours .
following police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman came from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the accompanying programme with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ w .
city and tra@@ ders plan &quot; homeland @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the city centre in September .
the commercial society and city authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract inhabitants to the downtown shopping district .
as Chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend to raise customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket product .
the market is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
local companies should also present their training places .
in addition , the city center will invite the city center to &quot; co @-@ night sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
target not only to the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commer@@ ci@@ als are on the radio , internet video and printed bag that refer to the promotional weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal government and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the commercial society and the city go into another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; project .
these include new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold @-@ on Sunday , discussions with all the entrepreneurs and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customers will also be new or re @-@ opened .
these include short guests and tourists .
but many locals had lost the city center at shopping .
at the end , all of them would help to revi@@ ve the city center - up to rental owners , the factories throughout the whole city and clubs .
it applied to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly spread rapidly , king had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , divided that in the nationwide third &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian towns will participate in the nationwide .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
the day was &quot; for the appreciation of the local trade , and its meaning for the community of our cities are stronger , &quot; says Stre@@ ich .
the Action on the spring of the I@@ HK and with many partners also make it clear that each citizen can be able to influence its class behaviour in direct environment .

Tr@@ ump paid out by telephone calls from telephone calls to Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were released by Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
the US president declared him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promises to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and gay , Mexico to pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first inc@@ entive with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Gy@@ bull was also released and revealed an anti @-@ r@@ ins@@ ed exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Do@@ bull , that a trade for the United States , who emigrated to Australia , would be ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration , had to look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban for re@@ location of refugees in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Do@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists introduce rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in rural Monroe ( Metro Atlanta , Georgia ) and had shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car , four black passengers and a white driver managed to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle @-@ aged age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar , looking through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants the occup@@ ants are in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scar@@ c@@ ely torn the silence , when a young black man was torn off the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only one night setting .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all of them were very real sigh@@ s in the audience .
since 2005 , civil rights for Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge comes back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - played by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted because of the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no only person was arrested , although we see them in our communities although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden to our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law@@ makers .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong was never corrected .
&quot; we want to prosecution , we want to ending , we want to heal , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we can &apos;t go to healing and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot;
a court court lays a towel on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agent received from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects stay on the free foot for decades , Citiz@@ enship say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : Politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice published the first time in Georgia to vote their voice for the first time in Georgia .
about at the same time as the FBI &apos;s election as Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - reportedly due to a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city have been that h@@ ester of Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y slept and that the baby , which she wore , was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to jail .
but when they drew off the jail and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b was ring@@ ed by the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the kill@@ ings and ordered , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between government and local prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evidence was eliminated , and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it again .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you sign up and if you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual survey of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , stra@@ pping , and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many believe he doesn &apos;t exist anymore in America .
it is difficult to watch out , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we will be confron@@ ted with his hem@@ or@@ ality in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to listen to what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - into a room and loud , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ to@@ il since years , but he said , the role will never be simpler .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a tried to play the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester scre@@ ams and be@@ ating him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , tiny from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a for@@ ts the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the l@@ est .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; he said , still ch@@ uck@@ ling .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; n --- he said . &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; funny one of the other black actors .
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and right there , the energy in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie will be replaced the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy making it right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene will start again .
this time when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it cris@@ p and re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
a woman , clothed with sack@@ cloth , is talking about the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and enter@@ tains cheap holidays of lob@@ b@@ ying pra@@ ises &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks out every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators watching the sweat and tears from his eyes .
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many of them down the street .
they have experienced acute humidity for almost eight hours , when bro@@ o@@ ks lead them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
by this point , the Mor@@ de remains an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you find on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air has been donated .
when the final scores of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood , and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he would remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after some minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors take a throw away and wi@@ pe out her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , which the C@@ lan@@ member has played .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience goes together with actors for dinner .
on a table a white couple from Atlanta stimul@@ ates the reproduction with a black pair , which she had just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski wanted to find out words which feeling the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it with me can believe me that the ly@@ n@@ ap still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks Hof stops at his table , he e@@ at@@ eth and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing of it then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work director Frank Cast@@ orf works on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging from a gigantic , six @-@ story back@@ drop .
the Rot@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pla@@ ste and el@@ bows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pla@@ ste and el@@ ast@@ ew@@ est &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s market or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park was pos@@ ing in which the Rhine is pos@@ er than rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stacked oil f@@ iller remind of Cast@@ or@@ f Leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - moving through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three en@@ por@@ ters - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner , were well harmon@@ ious at &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
she will perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cig@@ ars in Hollywood @-@ Mani@@ er a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give T@@ ie allo @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
even the scene , when he proposes Siegfried .
later on , Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) also has to believe that .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with its powerful applause .
stor@@ my parties Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and bowed his hands on the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
great applause are available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat once again in empty leisure clothes .
the show was eag@@ erly a@@ waited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ et@@ eam label .
in 2013 , he was still going to have an enormous Pfei@@ f@@ concert in 2013 , five years later , there were big jubil@@ ation in which the spor@@ adic &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; were going to be interrupted .
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has come together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perspective .
I prefer a positive result .
max quantity works as volunteer
they work at several locations in their voluntary year .
where to everywhere ?
amount : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture train , once in the week I hel@@ pe here in Gre@@ ven near the furniture bridge .
and I already worked at school in an open full day .
how are your experiences thereby ?
lots : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , a late professional volunteer .
how does it come ?
quantity : I have completed high school .
and then studies in engineering , let &apos;s say success successfully .
I recognized it for me , that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different , people work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there &apos;s a gli@@ mp@@ se , there you can see how it &apos;s on site , in the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my degree in social security in the winter semester .
I will inter@@ sex study , probably in the youth welfare Her@@ ne , a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not unusual , during which volunteers have several different purposes ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it &apos;s always good to look where you are FS@@ J .
you can make it from aging home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also part of the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
to me , that was just the right thing I get dressed .
I could recognize and see my own strengths and see how it really expi@@ res .
different from Civil Engineering ?
quantity : sure , it &apos;s not about to calculate St@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people &apos;s head , each of which have a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been picked out from the family - you always have to go to it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no touch @-@ down ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life .
Pear@@ son comes down another 3,000 jobs and dis@@ covers the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their interim divi@@ ding by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the job reduction , the Director General John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , at which 4,000 points have lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast step towards the digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House on behalf of Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the business year remains unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .

un@@ approved local reports were reportedly found during the incident at the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district , three civilians .
bombing was the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul .
in a NATO statement , the explosion occurred on Thursday night , as a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army attacked impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement says that all injuries are located in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspondence say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide @-@ car bomb killing at least 30 people in a former Shi@@ ite district of Kabul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , an enormous bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack ever since the US forces defeated the Taliban of power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Return decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by reason to shut@@ down
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the Obama administration of Obama , under which the states are obliged to con@@ strain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was carried out a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the step@@ ping def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we react to our government partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation .
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , which should be measured in a part of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions in which a part of the country must be determined to comply with more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to raise a broad range of environment that was imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and protection groups that are worried about the effects of larger emissions in public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air that o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and intensi@@ fy respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Communal Living Room : common Room
in the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parts , the joint zone of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ery decides the establishment of a common room in the future retirement homes .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing basic land is reported , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
while it still continues until the church community is still owned by the church community , there is now no planning for planning by a private investor to st@@ em@@ atic project more .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - around 55 square metres - and a neighboring terrace with a total of 70 square meters covering a special price .
the administration and majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room , will not be seen as a meeting point just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ly living space , but open to the church .
as an example , the word of &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to be reconc@@ iled by the provision of funds for the current budget already introduced last autumn , by grants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be that T@@ j@@ aden is reporting to 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision to indicate the investor wants to dis@@ regard the investor from the legs , that is close to him in this respect , that both the saddle - what is le@@ ak@@ age to the environment - as well as pulse @-@ height reduces and construc@@ ting the construction - would be possible .
need@@ less , not just Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps : unanimously , he is the body .
it is not so easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation is referring to the many of its own building with which you don &apos;t get so right now , you don &apos;t go to the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I am doing so hard to do so . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - however , absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees a conce@@ aled sub@@ sidy of anyway @-@ employed assets or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface , one is not given a sub@@ sidy but will get a real , in doubt , in the case of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request , requ@@ esting the decision , found three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step , a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hiking in the resin of star
in Har@@ z , Germany is supposed to develop the first &quot; star@@ base path . &quot;
this is the plan of the Club Z@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet pass in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ base &quot; comes to meet the assistance of many resin visits , called it .
he connects nature , science , movement , and sporting power .
members want to open up along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase of 2018 the club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able installations over five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come to St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ade and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be supplem@@ ented by the internet .
this is why the site selection is a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later , the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train should be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star@@ base , the viewer experience much knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association .
they also taught that why stars would have different colors or why a star is becoming stronger than another , although it is far further away .
convey@@ s also become an chosen star in which constellation can be seen and when he is best to see .
the club has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way galaxy and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy clearly visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the initiative of the planetary planet@@ arium , a similar similar to the planned cluster - the planetary path .
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ bles ( town@@ ship ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the boards with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned in the distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters , while the sun measures approximately 75 meters away , the sun measures 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the distance between the planetary cycles is just four kilometres .
while light from Sun up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed string but would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Garcia which should be standing in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ Off@@ ices in Los Angeles , until Garcia the un@@ break@@ able World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s L@@ igh@@ tweight Co@@ vers , which went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , to welcome the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ spring @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as win by unanim@@ ous resolution over the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you doing , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm at ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photographs posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate that would be a possible show@@ down between the battles the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; I have increased for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so great .
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down on light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year , in order to make an appointment in the next summer with the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell for their lightweight fighting game in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and then pushed forward to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he treasures Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the three combat champion from River@@ side look very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you want to do the co @-@ off . &quot;
Garcia was saying the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the moment@@ um that had built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded to tyre @-@ plat@@ el@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously injured in the A7 on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the connection of the market , presumably based on a tyre board the control over its vehicle .
the car dra@@ fted to the right to the ar@@ mis@@ tice , where he over@@ struck and then lying on the roof in a green strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of injuries by the ambul@@ ance , the A7 toward the north was closed for approximately one hour , after that the traffic on the left lanes could pass by the accident of the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; hang chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the season 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener of Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defense transformation into Au@@ e points is bringing .
with the first seasonal game And@@ re Hoffmann was content , with the result , would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 versus Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Erz@@ gebirge the rotating chain is also to be optimized .
and a fool following a stra@@ tification should also no longer be affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that there is no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will also fit in preparation with the thresh@@ ing chain better than with the quad@@ ran@@ ette .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we are inter@@ acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure about his job , &quot; because we just hit the half @-@ line on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mise is , but we can make it better , and we cannot afford such a lot of ab@@ norm@@ ality in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann is travelling to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are able to speak after a mis@@ sive start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and will focus on the trop@@ hy we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach did not want to know anything .
&quot; I only took the start into the season after six to eight play days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Radio , who does not want to speak about an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of Saxony had to be abor@@ ted early because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believes that the player from Au@@ e might perhaps be a bit more fresh , as they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion fav@@ oured in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be a little favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) final stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take it away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2 . Bundesliga match which you have to hit by the out@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una leader coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gan@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday at no event .
new results published by the Swedish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Swedish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; application tests &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzle clearance ) has started with the implementation of tests last year .
they should be more closely observed during the asylum process after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) for failure in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees was critici@@ zed for the age of years .
until now Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et sent 6,@@ 880 out of tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older than in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency ruled that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly constant during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied to its age .
in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age ass@@ essing , in the x @-@ rays of we@@ ish@@ teeth and MRI images of kne@@ e @-@ joints , which are then analyzed by the denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ska Institute &apos;s Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ska Institute , which includes work to assess the biological maturity of people to see whether they walked in sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assess the biological age this way is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t say it for sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
however , G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ends the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of getting a child less properly , is small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest risk is in this case , if the person is just under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in Plan
work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are moving forward nicely .
a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very well in the time , it &apos;s super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Light , Head of road traffic and Transport at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
at the same time , work started on all three restoration bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is safe , that the timet@@ able is to be met .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , she has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning at the north side a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge valve .
this is an attachment , which is also used as an operation .
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge valve is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way went out .
the particular part is that there are manufacturing components , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge parts .
a special sensitivity will require the laying of lines through the building work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a glass fibre cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
local residents were informed of the project by hand@@ bal@@ lot over the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be m@@ ashed away .
for the bridges between the building and the scra@@ m@@ ower in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic lane is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher the entrance is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three frac@@ tures are 700 000 euros .
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it doesn &apos;t appear so often that parties go on a branch , but if it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , come together , which is otherwise difficult to bring in a hat .
the parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows that day peaceful flag due to a broad alliance , which invites the Af@@ ro in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle , Ron@@ dell to the &quot; Big Choice &quot; campaign .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot early hours before the event are , don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally planned , the city @-@ pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ro @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture which offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organiz@@ ators , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and a lot of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , whom the Af@@ ro could eat without problems &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , pointing out presence , mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ism reported that he has been trying to obtain such an event and the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us Church . there are not enough parking spaces .
so Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ ay is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
overlooking the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ es@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
it also does : around 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ pre@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , several speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate Af@@ ro @-@ Chair@@ s Uwe Young .
in the Hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers , who are waiting for the top candidate for the general election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Prime Minister , Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ ro @-@ Event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is just after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special inci@@ dents .

thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a sol@@ oist of the SWR symph@@ onic orchestra .
both combines the lust , not only to exceed the limits on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ die , N@@ ils W@@ atz , plays classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating artistic work .
this piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ essel has written it for the two musicians and wrote more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acoustic is being aware of the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of her life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart completely open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I put on grilled cheese once I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood star was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who ultimately went bitter after@@ ward .
despite all this , the brunette student compared to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was really serious in love with whom I have done .
or do you think about it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that they are bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in the du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked it , not seriously taken seriously . &quot;
she particularly liked it according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz , &quot; but in the school time , as they rather disgu@@ ised as a be@@ aver : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and damaged .
now I look back and think myself : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public she loves her love life : &quot; people expect you to be relatively poor and that anno@@ ys me .
and maybe you call me some sort of un@@ cann@@ y , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; Governor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic Governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a big announcement in the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice has not won the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
according to Forbes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the State is elected in 2016 .
Forbes put that he has coal mine in five states and inherited a coal mine from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republican National Committee on Thursday evening announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather than work towards us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 gover@@ ns and the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party that is not capable of finding a positive , reas@@ oning message , &quot; said the R@@ NC Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News statement .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; Russian debt for D@@ oping down scandal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday that he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated , it wasn &apos;t the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian Athletics boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF World Championships on the eve of athle@@ tics World Championships that the ban from his country was accurate and that he was determined to fight d@@ oping the D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes with gold medals and silver medals were shot away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban on November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had been found evidence of state sponsored d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress was pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised themselves that they have experienced some pretty hot times and everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think progress has been achieved , but Congress supporting the recommendations of Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do anything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will begin at the athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
drug tests are still in@@ adequate and prohibited instruc@@ tors are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers scra@@ m@@ ated in Mali
at a funeral party in North h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two were thought at a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
at the still un@@ resolved case of crash , Defense Minister Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
they described the two stunning pilots , but as the &quot; jubil@@ ee of her trade . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have completed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ erh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann came from Nord@@ h@@ essen on Wednesday one week ago in the West African Mali .
their rop@@ es were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death @-@ wake of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
afterwards , the funeral in the circle of family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the federal army and politics .
among them H@@ ess@@ ens became Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the Director @-@ General of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the sk@@ inn@@ est laid ro@@ ses down , and they were standing in arm in his arm .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the minister of defence of the Le@@ yen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander sh@@ ot@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ents .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , declared to whom the soldiers said , &quot; If this occupation could not waste the crash , there would not have been mist@@ aken . &quot;
doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen did not show how dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the sac@@ s were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants to not give a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) will not be buried next to his wife .
this shared the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a s@@ nat@@ ch for both of them .
the Queen was understood by her husband &apos;s decision , she was named in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made out a command that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to be king .
he went into retirement in 2016 , and he also puts the title &quot; Prince Bud@@ di@@ pole . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and the function that he wanted , he could not see himself as equivalent to his wife , not even after death , explained L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chef of the Danish Royal House .
where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
but he did not int@@ ent to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always had a serious stand at the Dan@@ e of Denmark in his nearly 50 years .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik talked about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , sei@@ zu@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had allowed the reputation to be the brand of society critical intellectu@@ als , I couldn &apos;t hope in respect .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier Weil wants a rapid new election
CDU and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
however , defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government equality for a rapid re @-@ election of the national day , but he does not want to re@@ sign .
he spoke on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
previously , the be@@ ati@@ al ex@@ iting of a Green MPs from its Land@@ marks in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the election election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its suc@@ cin@@ ct one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the Opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ens co @-@ founded its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained to Hanover on Friday .
CDU leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
in this way , CDU and F@@ DP would have combined 69 seats in the Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag was voted on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green national government had to decide whether it could move forward in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil believes , however , is strictly necessary that the Land@@ tag decides to immediately include his self @-@ resolution solution .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Parliament also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament cho@@ oses confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
these possibilities have to be properly checked , &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said .
&quot; in peace , you will discuss all questions when it is legally insp@@ ected . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the we@@ stern@@ ly step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the political scientist himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described themselves as a tra@@ itor of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens requested the s@@ lan@@ ced Euro MPs back to the return of their Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we are leaving her Land@@ tag on which she has received over the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
they deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in front of the background there were no content differences , we cannot escape this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD @-@ Chancellor @-@ candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the conviction of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Palestinian Citiz@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ EPs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the CDU as a betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not just the betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Friday .
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ elect the Land@@ tag .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens will cost the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
the political scientist &quot; in her last con@@ d@@ iness and in her fru@@ strations their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue , tried to propose political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
int@@ ent &apos;s CDU leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ k@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to include El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets in the CDU .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ ens before , with personal career opportunities to fall the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the CDU was strongest in front of the SPD &apos;s SPD , but SPD and Green had a very thin majority of a voice in the Parliament .
Home Affairs Minister in Interview - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ enberg , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses over contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Schmidt Schmidt , how can the consumers protect from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumers and consumers who want to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp up .
on the consumer protection portal , www.@@ gro@@ mm@@ n@@ ung@@ .de introducing the states the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after everything we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di is taking on the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has immediately shut down immediately and has since become acquain@@ ted with Germany &apos;s suffer@@ ings in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and the risk ass@@ essments are available for consumers .
the trade has just like the manufacturer to worry about selling the sold products and are harmless heal@@ th@@ wise .
if the blood @-@ density content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg has been exceeded , these are non @-@ market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the establishments are to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge , the production plants meets no immediate guilt .
rather , they must be expected to calculate illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always , in the appointment of too little Con@@ trol@@ le@@ urs .
is it only missing on the staff or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls which have revealed the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded as 100 percent .
therefore , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ ing to the public prosecutor in the cases where crimes can occur , are of crucial importance .
I have already made several times clearly , that I expect a decisive education from the responsible authorities .
is regular bur@@ gers really necessary in food and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get safe and market@@ able food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are right .
through the ar@@ mo@@ red means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are caught up into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ tici@@ des fi@@ bre@@ il is not acceptable in the post@@ ure of life and must be stopped immediately .
this must be ri@@ gor@@ ously worked on all levels and worked with high @-@ pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is del@@ u@@ stom@@ ed and ad@@ orable .
how the financial rules of the soccer rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules which aim to aim to prevent hypo@@ critical issues of European football club will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain in UEFA , for the leading organization that supervised the European game has power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play @-@ rules , which have been launched by UEFA in 2011 means that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to $ 10 million a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make money @-@ loose with safety so that N@@ ey@@ mar signs and bring him into another stars in view of the funding of the team by the energy rich Gl@@ asses of Qatar .
clubs may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to engage with legitimate sources , which allow them to allow the break @-@ even point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in 2007 after his election to the UEFA President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had huge debt in their quest for success , effectively seduc@@ es and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in@@ ating when banks or owners have returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P from concent@@ rating on the liabilities of clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - invested a club with potential and then invested power@@ fully to build the team and build a global mark - in a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P adjustment period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million .
and even though Plat@@ ini has fallen by the Presi@@ dency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to reg@@ ain about excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ fal@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , compared with The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for billing for the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the total fee for the next five years will be issued in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is located in the possession of Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G was granted a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to € 20 million , and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 is limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ take their finance view by taking their income by companies linked to the owners of a club .
while the PS@@ G company could support the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market interest , UEFA is not regarded as a legitimate income .
this happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of PSA by Qatar Tourism Authority was pu@@ ffed up .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar through payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar could come in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar WM am@@ bass@@ adors will be just trying to find out a such man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA is still more attentive to note any attempt to get the rules .
the UEFA has no prepared talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , because they were not fu@@ eled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the club assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent according to the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s withdrawal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial D@@ oping &quot; by the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G .
Arsenal manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that subsidi@@ zes an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;

but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to make an effort for renewal of the contract during spring 2018 .

this re@@ petition of history is also nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old gr@@ unge period ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that means for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d were going to greater things .
as a cultural species it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era with permanent memories .
but as franchise it feels like , the time would be slightly .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked amaz@@ ingly good , not just because of its absurd lob@@ s ( it contained a original story for a speaking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by shifting toward the nu@@ cle@@ us of the g@@ ags - actor middle ages play hor@@ ny children who grow up - still managed to win the possibility to win the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult , who now play adults is less emotional roots and his par@@ ody is far beyond the wat@@ ering principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s , like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Hand showing the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point there is a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows the Matt D@@ illons Lower Cu@@ bes of &quot; Singles &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old bu@@ acker .
it is the moments of random mad@@ ness that could use this franchise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; as soon as he achieved what I saw as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang from &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Amazon has now rec@@ alled a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to re@@ launch the Cold War &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the compositions by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka &apos;s comedy by R@@ hy@@ s Thomas , a director of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main tro@@ lls - a hard sp@@ aw@@ ful Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ el@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt is synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess on TV , as Americans do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent match of &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan @-@ mask is involved , that it often plays as a single one .
six long episodes are there , and the comedy is not quick or frequently enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was edited by a less@@ er length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ Sati@@ re could always deliver the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined Communist audience is that western culture can do everything for food .

blow against drug @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched for , like the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
at the age of 25 , 15 mo@@ ors were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 and were already issued arrest war@@ rants for these arrest .
in addition , the officers provided greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same time Raz@@ or in Italy two people were arrested .
the German arrest war@@ rants were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
these two are therefore expected to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
the action took part in the promotion of Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the members of the Mafia , drug crimin@@ ality , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y , are accused of rob@@ ber@@ y and rob@@ ber@@ y .
already in the summer of 2016 , the prosecutor &apos;s office was established against the organised drugs trading in the South German area .
between the public prosecutor in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ tical Rot@@ tw@@ eil and had almost daily contact with their colleagues to Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , on Wednesday morning , four officials from Palermo was accompanied .
the Vis@@ cer@@ ity of the investigations were mainly Italian citizens with respect to Italian m@@ afia .
a incident on the 27th of May in Hü@@ fingen , which had been fired several shots into a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the band &apos;s account .
ways compl@@ ains big g@@ aps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who do not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report the foreig@@ ner stops in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partial def@@ ici@@ encies in asylum procedures .
the representative for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has according to a media report insi@@ sted on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register .
short@@ com@@ ings of the data registered there could result in asylum procedures and shifts in some serious adverse events , in a analysis which is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are estimated with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by approximately 600 foreign country agencies in Germany .
because the data had not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality is not so good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are long ago no longer in life , or by citizens , the German citizens , and in the register don &apos;t need to appear anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong data en@@ cores can slow down recur@@ ring processes significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics of more out@@ dated people , the EU citizens are covered that would not have to go out .
such a false statements , however , led &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with trav@@ eler , so it is therefore in analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government has obviously begun to return refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children back to Italy if they have travelled from there .
it emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ out@@ cker Zeitung &quot; reports .
according to the paper , B@@ AM@@ F calls such methods for families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 again . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
according to the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees .
if a mig@@ rant arrives in another EU country , this state can send him back into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason the ministry is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increases significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy have handed over for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold that promise for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokesperson of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of Human Rights and a companion of childhood . &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of the living individuals living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach was already available for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday .
at all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his meanwhile 100 donations , has meanwhile divided 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation stran@@ ts in the meeting of the Municipal Council to don@@ ate multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome , as our body is laid out and we are willing to provide the don@@ or who provide their blood for foreigners , still un@@ profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps multiple people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the rotary inde@@ ers of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are split into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so many people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating .
at the same time , corn@@ erst@@ while reported the actions that are carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , with 114 don@@ ors , we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circuit board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the theatre house had led to higher participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bre@@ ads were awarded to multiple sclerosis and were awarded for 50 skilled bleeding .
half as many injured Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of her life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to release later that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and we@@ aken the inflation to increase spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates to family come in the midst of a intensi@@ fied pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s policy @-@ policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members in this month , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and anticipated for 2018 on 1.6 % and anticipated that pressure would continue to continue on the budget . inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the coming years they would be necessary to ch@@ ase the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs could possibly rise more than expected in financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mamm@@ ut economy package which was issued a year ago after a Bre@@ xit .
it will challenge time for the financing plan to deliver budget funding for banks from the upcoming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billions of pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on real households will continue to use consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation , and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater dimension &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to expect the markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently predic@@ ts the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
however , the Bank points out that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would be made .
the Bank forecast down@@ right growth forecasts for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures increased expectations on a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover from the Bank towards the end of the year .
the latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , as the exac@@ erb@@ ation is still worse before they will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it added that wages were to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end of their three year @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of lower consumer spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the final judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the reputation was increased after a interest rate when inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households with three political decision makers in July to increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected to come again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay in relation to their target of 2 % may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should again be more competitive , as the lending are lou@@ dly looking for shops and want to complete the year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to cast a controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV preventive treatment in the N@@ HS from September onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that , before sexual intercourse , Pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , now is now considered by the first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he ple@@ dged to finance the process , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court in the last year , according to that the N@@ HS had to pay the powers that the local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was welcomed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
Pre@@ ex@@ position sp@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xe ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in infection cases .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to ask for the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered at a family specialist , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of the drugs during this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP using clinical evidence as it was used in a large scale , and is implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great intervention was to expand and over@@ take HIV / s increasingly successful efforts towards the prevention of HIV .
it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is focused on needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September an people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which really will be individually controlled and is subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome you very warm@@ ly . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out fast throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test Medicine was pro@@ cured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , Minister for Health , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delayed delay and delayed conversion .
the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to ending the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society as a step closer . &quot;
life Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banana with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed bags and sold their bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .
I showed me this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment was completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to go into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Dog@@ room and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she instructed the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was there to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to resolve the submission .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked above , without having to pick up b@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full heights - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper windows of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us can look down on the gl@@ amor@@ ous area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red , to leave it longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ tiful units offer room for all the bri@@ des and gl@@ ass@@ ware by Jo@@ anne .
by perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can complete the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are not new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering was inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that when you push the door , it &apos;s very easy to push . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or as your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground @-@ size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space , and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and that are therefore helping to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love you in electrical power outlets in the walls .
they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform themselves through a good design and increased square met@@ ry by something completely inv@@ entive .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property
two brothers are four decades after the Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a discussion because of one of the greatest real estate , Victori@@ as , worth more than 500 million dollars .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its business is supposed to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation over the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co je@@ ans family established there and grew up to a chain of 160 individual trading businesses .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in Stadt@@ zen@@ rum , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father , Colin made by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one third .
a court report states that Colin made its property worth $ 316 million , valued at a value of 176 million dollars .
for Paul , the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a pro@@ pul@@ cher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the convic@@ tions of Colin proposed him with the left which I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in an initial court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Court of Justice Court of Justice took place last Friday .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - of what Colin , as Paul claiming to be excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to ad@@ minister some poss@@ essions .
in an early affair that was filed by Colin , he said he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian writer writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held from the law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run dairy products and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ eries from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early 1970s a shop in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood properties that opened the first Je@@ ans@@ wood family in Colin .
Colin says he began West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of High School &quot; when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi died in 2012 , hoping to continue their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis business group , Colin claims that Mark at leaving the company paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; Paul says about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot;
Colin has held a very return , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took home with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered by text to say , &quot; I can really don &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to compl@@ ain and put my family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have seen that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ uman is planning to limit the president &apos;s media ab@@ stin@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do this .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff of the White House , he introduced a main problem in president Donald Tr@@ uman White House , which he wants to repair : bad news that got into the hands of the President .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow on him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys Di@@ agnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by super@@ vis@@ ing its media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship for television is enough for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a candidate was anno@@ yed because of a fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election officer Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February versus Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , tr@@ umps Twitter hab@@ it in control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ uman &apos;s Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; was under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps this campaign agents know something which we don &apos;t know other - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets could not contain more combus@@ tible material .
we &apos;ll probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that tr@@ ump didn &apos;t broadcast .
when his staff managed to keep it several times , anger from him , their efforts paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevented it , that Tr@@ ump controls are calling .
a part of the problem exists , that the people in an White House will always attempt to create their own agenda by presenting their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , which potentially promotes her views from the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO - entirely dealing with this story - reported in May over the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors who dou@@ bt@@ ful information about strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump can react to negative press lines , especially those with damaged Lec@@ tures , and that he will find out to figure out where these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened at the end of February , when someone issued a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , accused of being the deputy st@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of his Lec@@ tures &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had been ban@@ ished from Twitter because he had no specific evidence , he insi@@ sted on false alleg@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his counsel@@ ors are still stri@@ ving for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ un crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped .
the police ship over Europe this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of the pen@@ ic@@ ebre@@ akers are not known naturally , indications from the population will be hoped and ear@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting were hiding at vacation destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries were put together .
since 2016 , www.@@ e@@ um@@ East wanted to see more than 2.5 million times this site has been viewed .
36 of the online @-@ requested could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some ent@@ ailed trav@@ ellers on war , which have negotiated a field from the church in order to rec@@ ap@@ point a field in front of their man@@ ners .
the trav@@ ellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire @-@ Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they had been kicked out in May , without having been deported from a grave , un@@ troubled by a Council , to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered , to find a way .
angry residents ordered the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous citizen said : &quot; they went there on Monday night after they were sent to Bentley Heath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action by switching to the implementation , as it was us@@ eless in dealing with the problem .
the Travel@@ ers there in May were moved , and are now back again .
yesterday evening went to , probably even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the advice of Birmingham knows how to get around in order to protect their parks .
I live on the road brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay attention when the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last lap of this trav@@ eler , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ fu@@ elled camp on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and we work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps as quickly as possible .
to support our Be@@ we@@ iss@@ ance , it is very important that as many residents would report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts are currently being renovated and shall be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
those are good news for the city .
as with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during the former ambi@@ ence of the company , in April 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays are lost each year and has also lost revenues through the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatic rise numbers of refugees who came to the administrative district , the property building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at the time in the Municipal Council .
but in particular , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and said at that time by serious people interested in the house .
he should keep right .
group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a long time building container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , it will be clear to have extensive renov@@ ations .
the floors were torn out , bl@@ ank@@ ets and partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be re@@ done in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large accessible showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new window are installed .
everything was later &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer emerg@@ es .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it would not be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ ain , but already highlighted in a higher level of downtown .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms would look very much , explains the lou@@ der further .
both individual guests , groups or business people are to feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se he already led , so sha@@ vers .
the shows of the city are covered with the hotel @-@ group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer wants to set up exactly exactly .
he expects almost one million euros .
the outside areas are also brought to the fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace will be created by the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in Russia &apos;s affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special @-@ medi@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller should have inserted a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the Committee recorded work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal to the people trusted .
the newspaper opened the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
the CNN stations reported that there are already first checks of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps Di@@ test@@ em son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted in the 2016 Presi@@ dential elections .
Mu@@ eller is exam@@ ining whether they were going to vote between Tr@@ umps election team and Moscow .
there are several men in the focus of investigations , who acted in election campaign as advisor of the Republi@@ cans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special @-@ medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally wrote in the center and under@@ go the accus@@ ation whether the president might hin@@ der justice in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand lawyer &apos;s main task is to examine and decide whether the indictment is to be charged .
thus , Grand jur@@ ys are called the mer@@ sal chambers .
mostly they are switched on when larger and controversial cases are .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched from the public prosecutor to charge persons under E@@ ide .
according to the CNN station , CNN counted proposals that turn around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were promp@@ ted to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. did Tr@@ uman advis@@ ors and s@@ wimm@@ ers J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his associate Paul Man@@ a@@ fort with his talk .
experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the objec@@ tor show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly .
however , it must not necessarily mean that Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment .
nevertheless , the reduction of the committee from the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia &apos;s story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion that he knew nothing of the establishment of a Grand Jury .
however , these work usually work in the ear , he stressed .
the White House denied any measures aimed at the work of the special commission on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
once , the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey had said three times that not against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something changed , it was called in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ ust , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June , in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump had asked him to set an investigation into the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under large pressure because of the investigation .
according to US media , the White House collected material against the special atten@@ dees and its employees .
this dis@@ b@@ ulation spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller is dismissed .
unlike an independent special event of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller bought a position in which he could be fired on the president of the Ministry of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent this step .
on Thursday , two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators were submitted on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Ice mountain drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ c@@ tica , an enormous ice@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was replaced by the Sch@@ el@@ char@@ s .
this was distributed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the one trillion ton@@ ne and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large colon@@ des now drive north@@ ward and will probably take two , three years until it is melted .
it is with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest iron@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent , climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the broken colon@@ os@@ sus has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C bub@@ bly so far .
swi@@ ft is floating on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ festival is located south of South America almost at the front of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this sword spring , the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xing was disturbed some years ago .
a complete chocolate was falling there , writes A@@ WI research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ boy is in danger , as the front edge has never been re@@ treated as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate also stands under voltage and could dis@@ may , if at a key place a slice .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra and Eis@@ berg does not raise the sea level , as they swim in the water , and ice as much water as it gives to the melting itself .
however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at leads to the gl@@ aciers directly into the sea and much faster can be flowing as before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low measurements , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ festival is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ festival in Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI @-@ data .
the transfer from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the open ocean some 200 metres .
there it breaks regular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is a natural action and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice sheet is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the most significant withdrawal since the start of records , &quot; he also confirmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists , if the Lar@@ sen @-@ C sn@@ ail again grow again and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this trend will take decades .
even though this researcher did not withdraw the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg to climate change , so in recent decades the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula was crushed .
this long skir@@ t in Antar@@ c@@ tica covers South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
for the decline of the temperature increase .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated around three degrees in the past 50 years , and tell the areas where the temperature is fastest growing .
CDU wants home @-@ tariff for personnel
because it becomes more difficult to occupy freely @-@ going positions , the CDU , out of the employer association , is demanding to become more attractive .
shortly before the summer break , there was 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teachers at the circle are apparently very desired .
some 620 candidates were indicated for the places in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to continue personnel to cope with the requirements and tasks .
currently at the district M@@ ett@@ mann , there are no occupied places in the district M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CDU wants to take the initiative in the delivery day together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and join the lack of skilled professionals in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the desire of the parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to work a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands to skilled workers , but forward to future oriented applicants , is to say .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself extern@@ ally and extern@@ ally ori@@ ent specific measures for cross @-@ step races and include a practice offensive , CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one did not know earlier .
other cities adver@@ tise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , disease , or age @-@ condition@@ ally , comes from the service .
so it is high time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter is the leader of the CDU , with his party even beyond the joint application .
he has long been in the cra@@ yon for a fat @-@ thick surprise when he publicly posed the personnel charge in question and start@@ ling the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed , which enable ex@@ iting the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not coming to a satisfactory solution here , the Kreis@@ Administration asking the trade unions - perhaps stri@@ ve to cooperate with the county @-@ affiliated towns &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the CDU , the employees and the public is trying to pay better when it is subject to tari@@ ffs for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently pre @-@ written , increases or more money there is only if one changes in a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be furnished , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute legislation .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone of NGO migrants rescue bo@@ oting
Italy has NGOs working the life @-@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue their operations for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs sign no new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Home Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin @-@ based daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German charity organization &apos; Youth R@@ utt@@ led &apos; because their crew had effectively worked with hands @-@ traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which is in operation only since one year , refused to express itself as detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate at the moment in the search and life zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we collected all the information and evaluate the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ utt@@ &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , who has been monitoring the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is thought that its crew takes sl@@ ot@@ boat migrants aboard , delivered them directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive them , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such additional re@@ union took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Pro@@ secut@@ ors , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of susp@@ ending the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , the rescue par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other moti@@ ves to imp@@ ose .
under the code of behavi@@ our@@ al , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and life operations have so far been agreed to hold on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but acceptable to no &quot; fundamental changes or disability &quot; of their life @-@ related activities .
among those who refuse to sign themselves is the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ates Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said in the meantime , that the number of migrants who arrived at the rescue measures in Italy came heavily in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal waters and the cooperation with the local community of fruits have carried away .
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister .
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan Citiz@@ ens in this month &apos;s economic development and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali , to reduce the number of migrants to reach these countries in hope to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ ers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin branch &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the Northern Palat@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Castle and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
there were look@@ out spots , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the pre @-@ bearing planes .
in between , there were always longer att@@ achments , for the long tri@@ als to be rewarded .

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga fills up for E @-@ sport
are the Sport stars sitting in the future ahead of computer consol@@ es , instead of hur@@ ting on wind and weather to fight over the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been to a serious sector , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high points including .
this also recognized the first federal entity that are increasingly engaged in this area .
in the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , which followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ aze all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure , &quot; that on these train , some clubs will continue to rise . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA World Cup FIFA organis@@ es the World Interactive Club World Cup , where gam@@ ers compete with different clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven quali@@ fies .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen will now provide a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year old that young people will still go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian .
well , well @-@ known e @-@ athletes under contract could be far more often present on these markets than only once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it about ?
in the E @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup FIFA are cont@@ ested on competition level .
far , like in normal sport , have long been established , in which the professionals are facing each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it all about the correct sport ?
for many , the performance is quite normal .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ y has been dealt with the question long .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ Aid School in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only work on the console , but also exercise their body and watch on the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
F@@ ear@@ us also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot;
controls are elu@@ sive with online gaming and in the scene failed the structures of classical sports .
the scientists have a positive impact on the high integ@@ rative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the road internationally , that &apos;s like a great global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Education software ( BI@@ U ) states the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been invested in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tour@@ neys .
the turnover is expected to be 130 million in three years .
for the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is little .
however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
internationally , many countries are already on .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez will participate in the U.S. Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ sports bet@@ s Uni@@ kr@@ n .
in Europe too , a lot is in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ sport has been introduced as classes , says F@@ ear@@ y .
in the Netherlands and France , the German @-@ soccer league clubs are now obliged to host an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany returns , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clear the old times , it is not enough anymore .
it is about to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company will host the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; D@@ utt , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can &apos;t hold that only at football everything remains , as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy was condemned to suicide , condemned
a woman in Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by text and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of the conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced to death in June for the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the Father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter faced with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ lighted eyes when they were condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions were killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Prosecutor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she took no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are completely un@@ fortun@@ ate . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity is a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a prosecutor was an explanation by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there was no day in whom I don &apos;t empha@@ size the loss of my beloved son .
I would like to be proud of me and how I am going to be with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will bear to us for eternity with us , for his sisters there is to be there .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that they will be persecuted by the realization &quot; that she will never be participating in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not anymore , with whom I joined together since my birth , a pain that I am always kept with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legitimate preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime that makes it a crime to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a coal @-@ oxide pois@@ oning in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters reveal the text messages that she encouraged him to complete his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging on , spring from a building , but I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent into the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter searching for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by some press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few that Carter def@@ ending , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British fellow country@@ woman in Italy before it was acquitted on two years ago .
Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ved compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup , no coincidence .
the FC Bayern Rec@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - extra @-@ motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
something was otherwise on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even when the extra garment was very small , very small .
but far and wide on the second day of the Audi c@@ ops , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also not a new Manuel New , he made him split into the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer hasn &apos;t announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the Coach could also interpre@@ t me .

sugar@@ s are best distributed to those who want to give much more than those who want to keep at mood .
those who have chosen to go to L@@ ah@@ m &apos;s inheritance can only be used for a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want to be as a player . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old worked as a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m across the field .
to the right back , that &apos;s his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ me seemed like the one that can take the Ru@@ der to be best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ finished tro@@ upe .
he had the sight for all , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to make his missing fitness ( it &apos;s not fol@@ dable ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches pointed out on the performances of the Asia trip ( fol@@ dable also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as sw@@ am thus , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not neg@@ atively .
it worked out very well .
it ran down beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the ri@@ f@@ le , both confi@@ dently .
the renowned Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried to play a few times even in play @-@ building .
his colleague Rud@@ y announced that the result was &quot; not so , as we hoped it would be . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
game changes , temp@@ o changes : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ces , one sees to the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me passed a few cra@@ ck@@ ling statements on his new fellow players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I already noticed .

after all , he does not have to teach the New .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ lu@@ z@@ ischer Minister : Economics pra@@ ises knowledge .
it was often un@@ com@@ promis@@ ingly , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , still econom@@ ist of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new business Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers of commerce and companies from the region respond to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and t@@ add@@ les at the same time the old Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Frank Nat@@ us , head of the Association of Tri@@ vers Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that the Lem@@ ke has blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ er sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the driving force of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now .
still this year , the Ministry hopes for an planning procedure until 2021 , the building is expected to be right .
a role in the country &apos;s plans will also play the West@@ er@@ ysi@@ ung Trier , which is located in the round @-@ round demand of the federal government .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minister of Foreign Affairs , Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) in Trier , led by Wis@@ sing , is aiming at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend towards the German wine exports for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I also got an open ear for people who want to create their own company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ ise the HK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the plan@@ ing road construction , we have to be quick facts , at the same time it is the country &apos;s necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive director of the I@@ HK Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied by the 56 new engineers who want to adjust the wis@@ hl@@ ist in the state company .
the I@@ HK calls to sell more orders to external offices .

Frank Nat@@ us also expects another concept of the country , how it wants to fix the lack of skilled professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing would also be the previous broadband expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the ret@@ ina supplies in a I@@ HK survey only with the score 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ dy Internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Economic Minister Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke is out of politics at the moment and is still sitting on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .

Audi is expected to alter 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confron@@ ted with a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options than driving changes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so it moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to prohi@@ bit or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
neither the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the rules of carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ it diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , to install neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exhaust gases &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; also take to what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful auto@@ firms and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called &apos; de@@ af@@ ore@@ mentioned devices that could regulate emissions if a car has been tested , but back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others will be investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Audi Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in Germany &apos;s motor development .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could make Volkswagen extremely difficult : the luxury car manufacturer we@@ ars to win the profit of Volkswagen .

mor@@ dil@@ los b@@ oll@@ es and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most @-@ published Carto@@ on Animation , the Kn@@ oll@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ean still paints and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he be@@ fell among others as a drawing for greetings cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ ier day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded him at the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and then in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again , the artist had inspired himself to be inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures were hat@@ ched in drawings with the Pisa &apos;s Le@@ aning Tower , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still lives on the character , almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches are still finding a lot spread around the world .
since six years he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los as popular animal in its drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ more than counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the movie wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he is looking forward to the TV series , which is , like its original drawings , wor@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened with climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of drought conditions and consider@@ ations for insects , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , make great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural Research Institute of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past few years , who brought much less rain in the spring and much more .
this has impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the d@@ warf , and very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil sp@@ ends not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also in demand for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either weak@@ ened or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are considered in consideration , a better water distribution and deep@@ ening of ev@@ ap@@ oration belong to the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of flav@@ ours , which are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce weekly meet in wed@@ nes@@ days in order to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organised crime , corrupt civil servants , and un@@ audi@@ tory drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what makes it safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leaving them at home .
security experts have written three words on a tablet on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and stomach @-@ feelings .
there are drug inter@@ rup@@ tions , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the administration list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no resting periods of violence , and throughout the country , there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto announced his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 on attacks and threats from Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter , their editors and their asp@@ ir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will feel deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared issues , trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a son@@ ic of the Federal Prosecutor was built in 2010 , in order to edit the cases of journalists , they led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most thousands of murders that are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ derer of journalists are seldom stopped trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still have to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able , although the terrain is still av@@ eng@@ ed .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know this , we susp@@ end all . &quot;
on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th river .
the arch@@ ers drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly free in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but the theme of Val@@ dez , there is nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans have been arrested last year and the extradition of the country had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country because rival fac@@ tions are strug@@ gling here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone can be shot or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of knot@@ ted , two @-@ story m@@ um@@ m@@ asses for drug traff@@ icking , which are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lopez , a leader of the rival board fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication might have been off@@ ended the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought each copy of the output as soon as she was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error occurred in it , Val@@ dez does not force to force the same story after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues to im@@ itate that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ is@@ este in 2003 when he joined Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without hes@@ itation it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper engaged in a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took part .
repor@@ ters loved it to publish hard tre@@ ason without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were intri@@ gu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dar@@ ed to deal with .
she was eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the committees for the protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they went .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; you must take over the task of getting to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done so much ? why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missing Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar over from the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine use ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like if you &apos;re dealing with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their home starting and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ care and self @-@ preser@@ vation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
when it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away .
the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones . days previously known that sp@@ y@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen searched for the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described governor for themselves as not trusted .
it is months ago , since the repor@@ ters went into the mountain region where drug co@@ ders are facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sp@@ ends on three main stories .
it was the assassination of the brother &apos;s former boxing scientist Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é of the government spending , which focused on the home town of the Governor .
and there was a group that has been in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write , that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug traff@@ icking and authorities .
a reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that ruled all the century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the repor@@ ters to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one who escaped the son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; a military assault .
only a few months ago , readers were considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body relief .
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez rub@@ bed a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ dest as they have written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on side@@ ways and construction .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists , because they said the truth .
she has since then asked that she is divided again by the government , because she is concerned that their anger has viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a gender society . &quot;

dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ oufl@@ age to devi@@ ate his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying .
researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even realize that his sli@@ pp@@ le skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; un@@ peaceful past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the immort@@ alized dinosau@@ rs that has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has researchers considering it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil species of its kind .
it was found by Shawn Radio when he took part in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b on March 21 , 2011 .
he met on something that appeared on the plateau , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum .
they spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground p@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only fl@@ ush a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has been sleeping , &quot; said the main actor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creation is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one of the most beautiful and best @-@ held dinosau@@ rs specimens go down - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing tank , probably threatened by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily damaged dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ oufl@@ age to hide themselves of pre@@ dat@@ ory animals , used a par@@ agli@@ de that is also known as a non @-@ bur@@ ial , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to soak up in its surroundings and soak up his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature out of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technici@@ an Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding , a widespread defence method in animal rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the counter sha@@ ded is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today living .
it suggests that the dinosau@@ rs was ch@@ ased out of enough pressure by carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , that evolution profits as a means of survival as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the Con@@ ter@@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belts - are much smaller and vulnerable than spo@@ ils , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , highly polished dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs ro@@ dents of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r rot@@ or was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including his con@@ ser@@ rated intest@@ ine to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alberta was so warm as south @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much more land than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ qu@@ ate skin but also maintained in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the result is that the animal is almost as looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you are just a little with the eyes Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal clusters , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r that stood on two legs , passed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ge@@ ared dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted from some of his frigh@@ tened ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology seem to believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been insul@@ ted after death in the sea and in the mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied .
the creature was found by Shawn Radio when he took part in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the be@@ aker dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , ra@@ ced by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ e@@ aters was har@@ med by the western Canada , flooded with the flooded river into the open sea .
but the underwater cover of the dinosau@@ r preserved his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the resi@@ ded re@@ mn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well received that the Hau@@ tre@@ ad still cover hol@@ low tank plates along the dinosau@@ r .
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of preser@@ vation as &apos; rarely as a win in the lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confused it will .
remaining in the skin still cover the hol@@ low arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed up .
I can count the sheds on his sole &apos; .
in the th@@ under@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age to A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilometres long St@@ s and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) highway on Thursday afternoon , some 20 people have been injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
after the first dis@@ closures of the police , there were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the junction , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a Ge@@ wit@@ ters almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , combined trucks .
there are no information about the exact number of injured parties .
it was mild to moderate injuries , a police pre@@ ten@@ ers said .
a large array of life vehicles was at the accident of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten @-@ kilometer long tra@@ ce@@ au was formed .
like an AZ reporter , there was also on the return way to massive disabilities - by many G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade noted the identification symbols of the vehicle , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock then another accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car @-@ car and a passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : No@@ zzle is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is ti@@ ft in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ing .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and w@@ akes up an uns@@ afe or ri@@ ps off the g@@ ast right out of the work@@ flow .
ticket sales .
but times of breaks are over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tested the work @-@ free ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that is taken in the room and used the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come on offer , wide we know it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will then be available at many other remote traffic routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; said an railroad speaker .
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; call the train card dev@@ al@@ uation without Schaff@@ ner .
to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have a online ticket - what already most passengers do already .
it is also necessary to have the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last one needs a seat reservation .
for the &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one gets up in the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My tickets . &quot;
with the test customers a button on the electronic dev@@ al@@ uation appears .
the train drivers have a message on their mobile devices , that passenger &apos;s X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
comes the train conductor when driving ticket control to place Y knows that there is a passenger &apos;s already @-@ made online ticket there .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; he just wants to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying personnel , check out the DB Navigator just myself .
this allows the passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Remote Traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to approach the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel , know that besides delay and pas@@ sions , the ticket checks are among the largest sleeves .
for often , in any case , one of the participants do not require any documents you need to use online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be submitted .
the result are endless discussions between traction motors and g@@ ast , which leads to worse mood in part or greater space and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and will take care of the creative workers at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also available on the service ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core .
only one day after she had arrived in New York City , the apartment sat in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolls through Facebook to their phone .
they stum@@ bled upon a post by somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it called it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually ad@@ ored on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people , the scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman stand before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and shou@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll all kill you ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to you and that we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the topic of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and life , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a fitting crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which she had numerous times in front of this morning , &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remin@@ ded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not bring them away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and tu@@ cked in it .
it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .
even if I was lucky enough to give you an experience in which she personally experienced no v@@ esti@@ al rac@@ ism , it is not unlike the next black women child .
I feel I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists responded to the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter associated with a local business partner who made lunch .
they were prepared bags and helped to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changes after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organis@@ ing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met after an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came by Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless inst@@ ances of people , often from wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their resistance .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their votes , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area responsible for his activ@@ ism around death cases .
his engagement brought the project closer , along with six other native people the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as those people are depicted , for so I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target was not to concentrate on he@@ eding experience - to show that it is in motion &quot; not for a Messiah &quot; that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls life as she loves and marry her wife .
&quot; I felt like nude , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be certain po@@ ign@@ ity at this work and for the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls is repe@@ ating the role of the black how@@ ling women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , having influenced the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in the year 2012 , identified the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly strug@@ gling to different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ matic type of action , &quot; which Fer@@ rell was chosen as a heart of the film because of their identity .
&quot; she was the person who raised this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the front line because of a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman stands so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone far , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Bel@@ mont is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
she still cl@@ ung to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; Meg@@ al@@ d@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct since the first presentation of 2009 the population in favour of advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the topic is hardly a cold .
even on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one to the bit Gallery say : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole Sc@@ ale ) , comes from the other side : &quot; do not need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ings ) or simply simply : &quot; mag@@ nit@@ ude ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the other business , the opponent will fear the pedestrian zone .
in addition , the gallery will be designed precisely on the grounds , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct marketing of their products offer .
the work will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery M@@ acher will want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers were very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to wish that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will arrive at the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is unlikely to be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping basket in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough in our city .
you see how many shop stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
however , since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the Market Hall remains unchanged .
after all , the goods offered are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer , and is really cheap .
as you see , shop stores are hired only by larger firms , because there are people often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special shops are almost no longer there and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit me together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
most of all : where should the farmers market go during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery has actually happened at some point .
or does it already create the bit @-@ bit gallery , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not going to work .
and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the ins@@ ane market , it has no more space thanks to the ins@@ ane person - as I find - sensu@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg .
if the pe@@ asant hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , that almost wei@@ rd the same - that hang about cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair @-@ sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret services analyst deployed a 35 @-@ year jail sentence after she publicly made diplomatic messages on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August , A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate resem@@ bl@@ ance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was co @-@ efficient in technology , computer science , and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a dis@@ si@@ p@@ tive dis@@ si@@ diary , which was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA , which could look like with those gen@@ om@@ ical data , a sharp , though something intellectual comment is not only to the form@@ att@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has already been talking about identification as a woman , was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white da@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits on a driver &apos;s seat , and a plat@@ in@@ blonde woman wearing - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cig@@ ars and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg for a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were ap@@ preh@@ ended to invali@@ d within two years , over the course of two years .
they even created a comic book &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which would like to transform a future in which the President of Chel@@ ep@@ hor@@ tic@@ ism would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas City , a welcome way of happy meeting was .
there is also the opening of the exhibition a little deep and strong , because Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways to fix them further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , it said that things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in one of the art &apos;s art , the art &apos;s art statement called Mann@@ ing with their superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic sm@@ ashing , whose foundation gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , her mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequ@@ ency - a thou@@ sand@@ mark of Cs and Gs and As , written in graphite .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to demonstrate the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , such as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological aspects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how sub@@ jective it are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works is from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an independent room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing as she emerg@@ es with a free release in the hand of the disciplines of the United States , like King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to cold your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so don &apos;t stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese if I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was pres@@ ump@@ y in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the middle of the room of the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ical simulation , which co@@ ves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , as all in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ em ) , which had been written with a pencil group of gene@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that de@@ formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
a nationwide thre@@ e@@ hunt is underway in a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who had been looking for susp@@ ects , after a man had been stab@@ bed to a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acquisition of the Cook County Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a brief public warning system , published by the police station in Chicago , discovered that the dead was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the event of the event for dead , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
L@@ ath@@ em has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been in@@ famous now and been excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is senior treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the university and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in touch with the police in the UK in contact and ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any conc@@ ei@@ vable way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Administration of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the suspect to susp@@ end the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of stay , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding the suspect .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building who had just had an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , the said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirmed that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the victim &apos;s background and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic fraud . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vi@@ cephal@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vi@@ z@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA schedule has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA schedule to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he doesn &apos;t contain anything in concern about Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the findings of by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly accept d@@ op@@ tically @-@ funded d@@ oping in Russian sport .
regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we lead the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has got an error .
all measures have been implemented .
but there was no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit that which does not exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales department R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v has problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report includes controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the support of d@@ oping control in Russia in November 2015 from the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell any eggs anymore
the divided the company groups .
it is a proper precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed that any health effects could be assumed , it was said in the message .
from now on , only eggs must be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to be tested negative on fi@@ en@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ cabinet .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett did not want to measure your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up at your e @-@ commerce start , but the p@@ olls did not work .
responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even when you spoke anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who manages the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .
she called people from the outside .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , specialized groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ s allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lint , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used for companies to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said that she had a better insight into what your staff think and feel at G@@ lint in the three years .
in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company which shows at a glance , which units have the most complaints and which managers have low con@@ s@@ ents results - so that you can check out why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not need the next utility to be involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which has been an ex @-@ employee , who has been published a blog post since then , with those who have spoken is punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lint , this desire for an overview a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognise , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the heart of Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit at the beginning of this year .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ lint , Conver@@ cent Company can send custom @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report with the employees of bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or rel@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences by consumers boy@@ cott , worker fluctu@@ ation and g@@ ages , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said that there was no possibility to pursue the problems of employees .
now since the company Conver@@ tible uses to have problems , who were previously sitting by executives that were still sitting in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or in@@ lu@@ ci@@ ents , quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can come closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who deri@@ ves the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment and disp@@ utes . &quot;
companies began to re@@ ster Ethics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ees @-@ Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen for ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to her right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that you did not prevent her dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lint and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which both have to start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ ters secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , and set up his total financing to $ 60 million .
this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex in research that shows that today &apos;s staff expect more than expected .
in competitive markets such as silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only w@@ agers .
employees want the feeling that you are accept@@ ing and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that feel their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In which both are Conver@@ tible and G@@ lint .
investors achieve ren@@ dering when their portfolio companies are doing well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the Analytics tools are promise by third parties , commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless when the manager of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks staff after your feedback , it can have a expectation that change on the way is .
and if the change doesn &apos;t get enough , or not at all , the dis@@ appointments and employees can motiv@@ ate them .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ter International , the company which has left to very focused on the collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
and whom do you not care about , why should I ? &quot;
Madison Reed , who passes through the monthly staff p@@ olls , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lint , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees it was to re@@ organise the decision of decision and quality of communication , to re@@ organise multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights over the staff , and it hopes that for a long run , this leads to a better commitment of workers in a industry that is known for high sales .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose your company .
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it will be at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team are talking on the campus .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break .
players who are registered to summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final tests before they return at 6 : 30 to the Water Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the guys the next three days a real p@@ enny mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least to the final on Friday .
that &apos;s why the first three sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 7 : 15 pm to meet the already full @-@ packed time schedule of the players .
a compromise from the two days is more than a day , where the Bru@@ ins shi@@ fted the camp almost a week after the last season and during summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he will support the control change of N@@ CAA , even when they add a further point to the many employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on it , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply push it , they plac@@ ken him , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we will come back to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear transi@@ tions of its fields , surrounded by a adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that already cleared a protective network behind a Tor@@ p@@ fo@@ ster , no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem , once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people would rent a room there and then set up there to set up a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and practice of a exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best thing we have .
so I don &apos;t worry about that too big .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counterfeit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with detection reports from third parties and their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential detection and to send them to fact , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 presidential election .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters flooded with false stories in May and Germany , if they do not succeed in order to eliminate social media networks as soon as they do not succeed in implementing the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will be launched a test of the new facts review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the realization that stories by fac@@ ten@@ ants will be stopped for third parties , people want more context to make profound decisions on what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his news Feed , to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the Scot@@ ney Castle in a sque@@ eze music video was seen and Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher was a can@@ op@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy headquarters in K@@ ent River , and is now an inspiration for an graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he wo@@ ken .
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it &apos;s not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional .
&quot; I have only re@@ acted on the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double bed in the 1700 &apos;s , which he worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is its thum@@ b pressure !
and letters smell of smoke , because at that time they lit a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as it would be even involved .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is involved with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived for nearly four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , see the archives and experience the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ stro@@ us creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in tren@@ ches .
he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle , and spoke with land @-@ care , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was not received in 2006 as the last producer , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent what had said : &quot; we could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch who fought two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all its gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s estate of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the pe@@ asant stood in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , that the family Dar@@ rell sang seven years throughout the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was portra@@ yed in the 18th century , filled his own funeral by filling a s@@ coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his Sar@@ g was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &apos; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be a great g@@ aun@@ t , and again debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
in other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ males , their school crises in giving rich old women , I put it to me as a lot of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ locked . &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des in search of other unique cre@@ b experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish game for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind it , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ n lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ an Chapel was covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the cover of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ an elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Frankfurter Rundschau ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Art@@ z &apos;s logo and slogan .
there will be a feast on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th at the end of August .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the promotion has been on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locking website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
in principle , we are the firm conviction that we know as bad Hon@@ ne@@ on citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
during the promotion , it is more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is to form@@ ulate a stand @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually she stand in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be paid by Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f &apos;s new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the Army
every year in early August , Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) , consul@@ ted on pension and transport operations in Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
so also this week .
on the first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the attempted put@@ sch attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Government now , five Vi@@ z@@ re@@ mier@@ s , as well as the Minister for Defense , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
in this way civilians were civilians in the Y@@ as .
the government re@@ mov@@ als the bre@@ wing on the military .
general Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup of Erdo@@ gan , Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ ers .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the motion of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as an instrument panel .
up to 4@@ 86 people who have been involved immediately at the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara following this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the crash attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the occasion to cleanse the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the grip ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ v@@ ague in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the General Staff , there are concerns about the increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the Army , which manifest itself among other things in the repe@@ al of the sec@@ ession of Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the wholesale accounts for the army and security forces will continue .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan suffered a further 73@@ 95 cas@@ u@@ ators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed like , then , Erdo@@ gan is t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als were earlier considered to be the real gent@@ lemen of the country .
in times , she appe@@ aled to her role as the Gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the World State Order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan suffered the power of the military step back to step , not least under calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is committed to targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer , who sought for asylum in fear of persecution abroad , sought for asylum in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
it is true that NATO could not leave NATO too cold .
anyway , there is doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ge of doubt in the service of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operating abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said president Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media .
he sees to lower the legal immig@@ rant to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for the benefit of visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , saving wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by going to change the way by the US in other countries such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who discuss the financial means to support themselves and have knowledge of the financial means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tr@@ ump said , quoted from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry plans track for racing ferry shuttle
again , over the past months , over the future of the Imm@@ ort@@ sh@@ utt@@ les came back in recent months - now it &apos;s supposed to go quickly .
even before the end of the year it should be built on the mar@@ ital circuit , which travels the tourist route .
in order to secure the future of the transportation services sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport still work on the track this year .
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ es to order and to mar@@ vel , the country has important connection to this especially for the tourism important link , &quot; stated public prosecutor , Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , on Friday in Erfurt .
the costs for the maintenance of the track tot@@ alled approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , will currently finally voted , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as an operator agreed on the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the timet@@ able , the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
that should be a continuation of the Renn@@ g shuttle on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ g shuttle is one of all popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ es .
during the last months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them regularly .
the circuit is also highly dil@@ api@@ dated .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about .
just as you thought that 2017 can &apos;t be tra@@ ced back in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the range of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , freelance professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start to take its ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the company will deliver a lot of it , and we &apos;ll see it much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the release of his new report .
modern sex @-@ dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners into robots using a silicone that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt to its robots &quot; adapt , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot through the shape of the fli@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there is still more troubled that many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would be a progressive woman in a progressive woman .
modern sex @-@ dolls have evolved into robots using a silicone .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they find , for example , rel@@ ent@@ ative .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she may like what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
it also has its m@@ oods throughout the day - just like real people !
it can be tired of being fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ r@@ ying aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ stran@@ gely female characteristics , the alleg@@ ations of rape when you go one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is getting wor@@ ris@@ ky one most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish , or just another sex toys .
its Orig@@ ination and its increasing refin@@ ement prove on something dark and Ti@@ efer@@ it in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of equality of gen@@ ders to a desire for sex with submission as an optional adding .
most men , of course , will have no sex robot , while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its rising popularity while the FR@@ R still remains on the mar@@ gins of consumer culture .
but what was le@@ ak@@ ening out of the fr@@ inge zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive , until they give the free market to them .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a period in which the rights of women are threatened by women , in which there has been an President in the White House , who has under@@ min@@ ed women sexually att@@ acking .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the closed body and em@@ itted eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment , this does not feel like a big jump .
the target behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
her builders wanting to feel human being , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; , robots don &apos;t pose a real women .
they can not separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no placement or background history , nothing , suggest@@ ing independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
expressed differently : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maids
m@@ umps core performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a binary of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which have polar@@ ised the US elec@@ torate , have also divided families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest celebration , there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump sel@@ ectable relations .
we were all told us all to make our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , families .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ headed poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visiting me this week in New York .
it remin@@ ded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , having fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
it is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it appears in a further connection that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we talk of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ assy way that our cookies won &apos;t be rep@@ lic@@ ated in one day .
however , there is still a difficult long @-@ term scenario in the tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a dec@@ ep@@ it@@ ome of dec@@ eption .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the crazy dog - the dog in the Aut@@ od@@ ah , which looked at 14 % of the income tax ( but at least did we know how his tax returns ) - both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact in a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of re@@ public@@ ans must be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin was in town , we brought our kids to Kar@@ us@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York &apos;s park department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ py and the animals rotate to look full of fear on their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ ates of climate convey@@ s this in a notable way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the subject @-@ pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
but Central Park @-@ Car@@ us@@ sel is still a strange magical experience here , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women to go on it and all have a great time .
if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily nobody asked them .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week , my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip money - this to buy something about the shop .
this does not only contribute to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to move personality into a situation in which no needed is .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ preh@@ ensive , while I fain@@ ted the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for the second time for a hospital .
last year , he was arrested because of the treatment of schi@@ p to his hands to the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder in a ple@@ a of pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Morning 2013 by shooting them several times by a door of the Toil@@ ets cabin inside his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin hidden .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say , it &apos;s too short .
the National Law En@@ forcement Administration said that it would rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us does not get danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

afterwards the classes appeared three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ds , the cylinder bore to the bet .
the eag@@ les stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
although the young was different than the other young ( cows ) , but belong to that .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his dest@@ iny lies to be free .
they wish every four @-@ t@@ aut that he felt himself in his new school .
thanks a word of thanks to colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always jumps back to classes , and parents representatives .
the ch@@ ick @-@ time is now over , the class@@ mates explained Sophia Schumacher .
they leave their pupils after two years of lessons only very ung@@ ers , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ aut .
finally , all pupils have a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ wheel@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians , on behalf of illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal people were arrested , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp@@ uses and lay out to everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , which is not responsible for this purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what these parties must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve exhaust behavior of cars of the euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or bad are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives ass@@ essments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously applied only for vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Squ@@ ad software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and from when will clients be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced their immediate implementation in the next few months , but no exact date is mentioned .
he has informed that Daimler has to write on each affected .
if it is an inspection one , I will do it in their frame .
how long does the retro@@ fitting change in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the connections are from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; as we have seen , the deal@@ ership could not deal with the topic of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop .
there could be some time consuming to make an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car of BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will have to wait for .
presumably , foreign manufacturers would move , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where the network is threatening .
in the rural area there is no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE will have to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize of President Tr@@ ump is promising to be politically .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first R@@ apper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding .
the L@@ ear Progressive TV series announced that this is why L@@ ear announced its participation in the gala &apos;s participation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even the means to withdraw - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clari@@ fy their visibility .
the Kennedy Zentrum named after the former President , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
among the former prize winners , Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing .
we make the city vibrant
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - however suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ mer has been born for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun to him as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it admi@@ res him that no application has to fulfill the requirements profile .
the city is looking for the next possible time an architect or engineer .
this should - under respect of regular notice of notice - still enough time for being elabor@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance authority for the administration of the Building Authority , the applicant must indicate appropriate connections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this feature wants to keep the city definitely .
if they are unable to fill this out more , citizens would have to travel to Offen@@ burg .
but close to the city and its own importance , W@@ acker says that of a good company lim@@ a as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years , some major projects have accumulated , and the h@@ ack@@ ers look back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing the city , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Low Water parking lot are joined .
the theat@@ rical bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the Sta@@ di@@ on@@ ation is still a theme .
the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; If we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
aged for a city @-@ gro@@ wer large game room exists .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ner@@ ei , it can be re@@ acted quite flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces become comm@@ end@@ able by citizens and visitors often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going urban building is st@@ amped .
the city master carries high responsibility .
he is Buil@@ der , &quot; at the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ay@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been around for 15 years .
also , that his successor is long , W@@ ack@@ ers wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot;
for continu@@ ity , continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the future design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , then it should be a degree in degree as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge of knowledge in the areas of construction and construction activities .
the municipal office is underground and civil engineering , building planning , property planning , property management , urban property management , urban operational management , and sub @-@ building authority and sub @-@ building authority including monument protection .
bike on pipes thrown : southern route closed
according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators brought the blue bicycle from the railway bridge in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so badly damaged , that the her@@ ald goods had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go from two male occup@@ ants and search for the night hours after them .
close to the crime scene there were a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bike driver was observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the Laus@@ bus@@ hes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB , Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators would have brought themselves in great danger and at risk of mig@@ rate .
besides the damage at the Lo@@ k and the plant and the delay @-@ minutes and the cost of rail service , P@@ ön@@ alen of railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern route could be led without disabilities .
there were almost ten families in the morning , two of which looked at the correspondence .
freight rates were not exp@@ elled , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of pi@@ pel@@ ines had to be exchanged .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to re@@ lie@@ ve IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amed Dar@@ ing )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based protein and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases could be left .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and fl@@ aps , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , loss of weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers found the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ ro@@ ate to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , will not enter into the body .
cells , which are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body , without fo@@ aming sensitive tissues .
if the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments , it was noticed that a kind of tolerance promoting immun@@ o@@ deficiency in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its inn@@ ards .
and the bacter@@ ium needed Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he proposed that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han varied diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ lic group , if the same system also work on humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of students who had such cells had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been accommod@@ ated separately .
it susp@@ ects that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the gl@@ ances of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they lack the mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment so they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers made L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then survived small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component has been cleaned out of liquid , it turned out as a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ism which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells decreased by approximately 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ bearing cells such as mice , and that most of us should protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , that Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho loved his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday night .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre@@ season game , before the UEFA Cup hit against Real Madrid on Tuesday and impressed you as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to sh@@ al .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes to improve Mour@@ in@@ ho to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mour@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him sooner than to be ready later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic started Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , Mour@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that Mour@@ in@@ ho still wanted three additional novel@@ ties , but he insi@@ sted that the club has done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four senior restructuring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four you get , so thank you to the club , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
it was a pro@@ longed test for new engines .
Boeing already had such advertising taken earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new fence for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind yet revol@@ ves : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD boss , the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister will always remain with a certain concern for Berlin .
only no distur@@ ban@@ ces of the party headquarters , just no head@@ wind from the federal government - thus the most important desire of the electoral struggle .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the people from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ned state capit@@ als .
what was said from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with head@@ winds in the approach .
these were civil strikes .
and one after another .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can &apos;t be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary Peter Di@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fra@@ gment in one green economy has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the election @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition launched its One @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green National Director Michael Kell@@ ner called for the tr@@ uss @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets to return to its mandate .
the acc@@ edes to the CDU means a clear violation of the electoral body .
El@@ ke T@@ ens must immediately return their mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and campaign of the Green Party Leader Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true enough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ s an SPD election fighting than on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ scene to the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the surrender of the green M@@ EPs El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ als for the CDU without its own government majority .
it is the provisional figure of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more than not , the comra@@ des were calm .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and it became - and it was all much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the reel , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ ite breath@@ ed the party smoothly .
in the weeks the comra@@ des then moved up again in the weeks .
then , when they had sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next deep breath came .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burnt .
and because he in crisis communication so pretty everything went wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz struggles for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil am .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
Mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tional values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe even so , Because in the past weeks , Weil attempted to implement the federation of acc@@ ents .
with Martin Schulz , comra@@ des of Hanover &apos;s former Mayor , not hidden his power in Berlin , was not hidden by Martin Schulz as well .
they let him grant him , as they spoke out of a stabil@@ ising the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
together , Weil meets the party &apos;s internal rule , there is no fault at the part@@ n@@ ical level .
and Schulz certainly don &apos;t know .
sometimes , comra@@ des , therefore , stri@@ ve to keep his own ranks close .
their wrath is committed to the green , and above all on the ab@@ out@@ ings of par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in the life@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democra@@ tised , as Mrs T@@ ens has her own career entry on the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ens is not elected as a direct @-@ candidate , but on the state list of the Lower @-@ Sax@@ onian Parliamentary Assembly , and the Dutch party de@@ pu@@ ties .
the logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of the four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on SPD as a top candidate in the general election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of personal career will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann further said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or further comm@@ it@@ ments of the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding for the city centre III
those who want to renov@@ ate the years will soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler inform@@ s and three representatives from urban development on Wednesday in sensation .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler announced again a review of the events .
since 1991 , there is a sensation in sensation .
at that time , in the San@@ itary region I from 1991 to 2004 , Baden @-@ Württemberg land took over two @-@ thirds of the funding sum@@ s .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , not only to develop new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , at the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , I received the information that there will be a renovation area III .
the funding amount tot@@ alled 8@@ 33 333 Euros , which would come to 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the community .
how does a refurb@@ ishment then develop ?
you will continue to investigate if the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of any interest of existing , to san@@ itation .
if necessary , area limits could be post@@ p@@ one again .
spent on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal state @-@ country &quot; Social city , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and preser@@ vation of infrastructure .
the measures would be objec@@ tively related , i.e. each plot is carried out .
the renovation area would eventually be established as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 2017 .
however , until September this year , however , the existing taking @-@ up would only be carried out , as part of those involved in the renovation area involved a questionnaire .
in November or December , the by@@ law took place in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that every Commun@@ e had to perform the said pre@@ ab @-@ investigations .
it means to evaluate the municipal w@@ ron@@ g@@ acy and decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and in which extent .
for the respective property there will be also a renovation mer@@ k in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after sensation and to make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , an essential success factor for the project was the participation of those involved .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens next weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Fo@@ und@@ el@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things for the structural condition and the restoration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; Hou@@ sehold and M@@ ow@@ els , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential area .
the blue &quot; operation arch &quot; is only to fill when working in the office space .
however , however , Got@@ zel gave it out that a p@@ aired questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding is supported by the &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes , lunch first .
there is no funding available for &quot; reserve &quot; later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the project , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the end a restoration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pal@@ atable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come to a hand@@ held movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he will open his door , his office , and even starting with a hand@@ held movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index fingers and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has concluded with Dr. Ge@@ off@@ Watson , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ the@@ tist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant method is carried out according to medical standard .

the promotional fees of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that will cost the American manufacturing of the last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers will cost the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president is on board , was the heart of the event held on July 17th in the White House with American design programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter designed in Connecticut was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ ft truck .
the White House &apos;s military office demanded the presence of helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or freight , scar@@ c@@ ely 36 hours before helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn after the recordings of the helicopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware that you are aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event in his superior , Deputy Chief of Nav@@ al Aviation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message was shown that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , on the South La@@ wn at 7@@ pm , and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in this evening .
note : adding that if the White House &apos;s departure should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight .
during the event , the original flight @-@ government was at the helicopter , while the security personnel remained at the plane during the period during the time .
from being provided by the TIM@@ E , it wasn &apos;t clear whether a second flight number was finally needed .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits federal government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 is asked whether the event could be inj@@ uri@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we did if it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if you are shut up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was marked by the White House as an official event and were not covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a violation of reform of health reform that was in the Senate in the way , and he propag@@ ated efforts to promote gender equality rules .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly any new phenomenon from politically advant@@ ageous purposes .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump resulted in an investigation in February , when the presidential plane was in front of his first campaign en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential vehicle by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states who are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy managing director of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 crew often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to dep@@ ose the US President at the White House with precise Zen@@ ob@@ ers@@ tics .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was at the White House 58 exercise landing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training equipment for the month , an official said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in additional 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support committees . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers did not acqu@@ iring the burden for any of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 doesn &apos;t have budget desig@@ nations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D conference set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unity list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual costs for operation of helicop@@ ters lie far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers determined based on the estimates of guidelines is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funding . &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the rates for DO@@ D will not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former senior citizen of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly worked .
it is , of course , reasonable to empha@@ size . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his round about the South La@@ wn at the event but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and gro@@ oves with the media about its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will occur tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel , at the table of the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still in f@@ ell@@ os@@ er , the leaders of the second tennis @-@ Bundesliga won the sense of reality .
team@@ leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay does not have respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
right on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for grade and stability , the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V mainly provide the imports coming from the high north .
&quot; the Danish and Finn@@ s are even able to refer to the Davis Cup .

&quot; it will be as hard for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss team for the trip to the high north is practically established .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
at the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ chman does not create the Bundesliga match in the Italian Bi@@ ella game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at the tournament in Czech liber@@ ec Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at its first deployment in this season .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he set his signature on Wednesday evening to put the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his eyes , the law passed , &quot; the Congress held a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated .
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed against the US violation .
at least , the design aims to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
since then , investors from home O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , is co @-@ financed by the Russian Baltic leaders Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is tremendous .
however , it is too early for an evaluation of the consequences , as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump had to raise sanctions even by Executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed what the Group could rep@@ el and what could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the city organis@@ es the Kit@@ a lunch table again .
with firm response partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centres the clock will be turned back .
on September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the city &apos;s care services in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
furthermore cooked by house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh @-@ boiled co@@ ols .
the city runs in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children have a warm meal .
in the past year , 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the need grow steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ days in the Kit@@ a at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers from the 1st September kitchen service : they have heating the supplied food , add them to the salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food off , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are tied in a Kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are much stronger , and it is easier for the Kit@@ al@@ line simple , educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the Team &apos;s kitchen is reasonable .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not continuously changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the Kit@@ a @-@ rooms - now also the task of the kitchen forces - will in future be done by special cleaning personnel .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen power and the charm , which she exhibited in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ent and foreign inheritance for the city as the most economical solution , says it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are set to be set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong in the education field at all about 750 persons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women , the UN says
elections can be only representative if all members of the company , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , reig@@ ning Director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are joined in the provinces in the provinces . three women are can@@ di@@ de for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be only truly representative and credible , if women are un@@ restricted and involved in all parts of the choice process .
the elections for the provincial council elections and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
Taliban have published threats against a choice process which coinci@@ des with the transition from international hos@@ tilities to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed down peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om , a strong role for women , will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern on investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union agency aims to make a certain commitment to the production of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company held over the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which produces , besides other products , Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits .
in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties , owners of Pla@@ i , invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s decided to express &quot; concerns about financing the production lines of production lines . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win from the General @-@ Site manager no clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross , affecting our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here , and labour forces are strongly focused on the local community and the metrop@@ olitan areas of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and well@@ being , and before the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the Eastern End of Glasgow strongly ur@@ gently need a bo@@ oming mining of production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesperson for plaque said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Toll@@ cross has just received a letter of G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this , since we encourage continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives of ra@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly examine our business , and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the inheritance of Toll@@ cross as a production facility . if our company changes will change at the location , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League likes to regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in her persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having given an offer of £ 189 million to cancel his free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have you warned Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has been heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds .
after the completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of over 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious via the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source close to Catal@@ ans insi@@ sts that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
as a Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign one of our players on sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish organisation put an interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow it to leave the International of Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers thrown and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ rator has been deliberately thrown in the Königs@@ felder street prior to the property number 30 and served so on the covering of the vehicle Sach@@ et by more than 200 Euro .

an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ ar@@ au and Le@@ ese looking for the police witnesses .
because he made a car in his lane to the track , the driver had to sof@@ ten and touch@@ screen the dra@@ fting of a VW Tour@@ an .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg L@@ occ@@ um was travelling with his VW at 19.@@ 55 on the B 215 from Stol@@ ar@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of Stol@@ ar@@ au , a passenger car was contrary to him , so that he had to turn right to the right .
in this context , the Tour@@ an drivers touch@@ screen the over@@ lap .
non@@ damage caused by car .
the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued its journey to take care of the traffic accident .
it can be good , according to the accident , that the car driver had not yet noticed the accident .
the police therefore asks witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the car , at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au .
interview : &quot; domain @-@ atzen report lists Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ ens@@ atzen report to the abuse of abuse by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means au@@ tho@@ red and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ nick atzen continues to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sen , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication across the German Press Agency , he acquired by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very much for the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express its deepest regret about its own under@@ ings or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
the Vatican Council &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in the coverage of violence against dom@@ inion with &quot; two different measures &quot; will be measured .
concerning the en@@ cro@@ achments in Regensburg , no one knows that it would have to be prevented and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media mani@@ pulation , &quot; such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committ@@ ees .
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church , as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experiences and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis stated in the interview with Bavarian Radio : &quot; we are happy to go to the Church and this is a big fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saw a totally normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one to be ready &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were unfair to apply today &apos;s standards on earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often di@@ ved .
completely to in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger , wrote the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the En@@ ist@@ um Regensburg which he introduced to the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 shel@@ ters per@@ missions were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high pl@@ undering &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ ize that Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms forms of physical and mental power .
due to high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for students could even be heavy .
contrary to numerous other sign@@ ories , many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R. , and in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann said , why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ nick atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has reli@@ eved in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of violence in the shel@@ ters &quot; shel@@ ters &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture taken by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
many students lift up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for others , it also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which was used by the econom@@ ist when a cathedral set has not brought any top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you use this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
at him , eight pages are dedicated , and he is clearly acquitted of every sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the violence processes at the pre @-@ school event took place outside of his action .
you can , too late , learn it too late or to have first suggestion not seriously enough .
the cathedral mo@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt from practically all respondents as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the broad majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent witness , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; understand@@ able , &quot; as highly goo@@ dly teacher who supplied the guys regularly with cakes , biscuits and bond@@ ons , and &quot; always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which also led to wound breaks .
that he had not only kn@@ itted with chairs and threw the key@@ presses on the ground , but also ear@@ ful boys in the hair or ears , he has already been deeply regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
however , his honorary deliver@@ ance must be said , however , that such education methods were widely distributed in the fra@@ y era , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents like in teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think anyone of us , who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a se@@ cular school , a state school .
compared to what it actually goes in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , are the free bag@@ at@@ ella .
it is already asking if it is not to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media had just thrown onto him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him would still be ze@@ al@@ ous .
but the truth is : the report ent@@ ails Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , there was a lot reported about the topic mis@@ use at the site of Regensburg .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report about any processing or complic@@ ation in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were con@@ se@@ cr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem at En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral person who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how is the job @-@ atzen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which he had been aware of ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I hold it ... also for a really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him ... b@@ ben as an ob@@ tru@@ sive or even more abund@@ antly , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ or conduc@@ tors , trust instruc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the advance affected people and / or their surroundings , the investigation could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concerned about sexual abuse , so Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak about every collabor@@ ator .
thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to put his good name together with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
in the media , much of &quot; Non@@ discrimination &quot; was to be read at the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Cathedral .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of &quot; looking . &quot;
does he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the great problem , that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
yet exactly this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separately : between pre@@ school and secondary school@@ mates , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as we say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , inci@@ dents of inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral rest@@ ors of the dom@@ es@@ hi@@ ker .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boy of sa@@ vi@@ di@@ st teachers were wrong and mal@@ nourished , all were all at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where truly sk@@ il@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he didn &apos;t get the boys only to face when they were already on the site .
it was on that , like the most witnesses , the subject &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ ic@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was no discipline there , but no sa@@ vi@@ ed violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many of the victims of the general humanity is estimated , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
so , at most , the alleg@@ ation remains a throw away .
yet despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods where it was reported from the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and began his predecess@@ ors at a school where he didn &apos;t work and was responsible ( such a witness ) , and then again around 1993 .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger fl@@ oss the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domain chamber , which the report was even re@@ produced .
in this he shows this , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the test will continue to practice . &quot;
he felt urgent influence over the risk of negative press coverage .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria in Germany .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows how to know .
it was hard to estimate that those affected are perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where actually the allow@@ able limit was exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have looked away .
it just doesn &apos;t matter .
only in 1980 , the test case for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and taxis claimed , it was unfair to apply to the current educational standards that time to time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , the past to today &apos;s moral measures .
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
but this obviously does not apply for sexual abuse , who was scar@@ c@@ ely in all times and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children , that is far beyond the time .
this is all awesome and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be stopped .
but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
its means to the punishment and punishment of punishment , i.e. ear@@ chers and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then it was forbidden , he also strictly kept it to it .
what is the picture of his days of reg@@ ain , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has been given the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; in talks with you ?
was the issue of exam@@ ining mag@@ nit@@ ures also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , meaning Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a tri@@ roll .
nevertheless , I didn &apos;t feel at no means that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without any un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably never have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ s , true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singers as well as every success , in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks to their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann said : thanks to the work on the book and beyond , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , low @-@ believing , deeply believing and warm @-@ good people , you could not imagine that he could only do a little bit too .
I receive regularly with how many former dom@@ inion is still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him to visit him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until now , that he was once hard to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the domains are thank@@ ful to him today , that he en@@ riches their lives and brought the world of music .
and that he always was a good , v@@ ain@@ ful teacher , a stum@@ bling father , certainly , that may be - but also a lo@@ ve@@ able resp@@ ect@@ fully , to which they still look and honor them .
and please , once more clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were the agenda at that time .
we can be glad we have overcome this time ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and one more prominent brother has to make the medi@@ al scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
there is the evil intention that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the an@@ ach@@ ting areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had gotten himself great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know not yet one of the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ uns , finally in peace .
