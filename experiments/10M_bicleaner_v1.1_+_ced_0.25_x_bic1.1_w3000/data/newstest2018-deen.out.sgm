<seg id="1">Munich, 1856: four maps that change your view into the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where youths should meet young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Minigardeners generate the hardest reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Münch promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that it had to be exciting, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a strapping road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are everything else than current - but is therefore very impressive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">It became clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is an Flickr carpet, which one can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called certificates, and so-called certificates.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian regulations between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since spring 1800, the French forces occupied Bavaria with Austria, during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course with military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Finally, when the French troops finally moved from Lunéville, February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a countrywide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "KurfürstMax IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and hence the Bayerische Vermessy Management" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Primary data sheet of Munich comes from 1856 and is available as all others on the Bavarian State library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruit / today is the most impressive state of the state.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is the sub-type, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map of the map, in 1877, as the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the bustling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the buildings are located around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is located, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in zoom, a small-piece map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten notes from the so-called "primitive" derived from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are only little plots there today, but farmers in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is characterised by the sub-sendling north.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the October festival, was actually still a meadow, and was not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the draft periodical, one reads not only the road name "at the Gasteig" or by the Anhöhe "on the lusts" - but also in the big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield street, one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "" "on the Auer Lüders" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the establishment of the psychiatrist who is brought to King Ludwigs II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended the purchase of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has prohibited the personnel to apply violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, first place was out, and it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the recycling plant in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now on the area of former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920, moved into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">The soccer field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of the houses of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" built in an architectural monument to the origin of the Irrenies, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was" "" "main place" "", "the Kaufstraße was named" Kaufinger alley "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied Forces took many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses, and a sewer's chapel of the Middle Ages were once located on the Marienhof, where these days are the preparations for the second S-Bahn tricycle on 5 April 2017.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the shooting-ler, the old Munich map can be compared with the air image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of Farming has exhibited a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discriminatory policy and the racist attacks in the state after Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which should come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and missourians, as a series of dubious, racial-based accidents occur in the entire state and here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain Discriminality, as well as the law enforcement agencies of the state, which are disproportionate the group, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of civil rights, which happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are attacked because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that has issued the organisation for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist violations of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances in the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during the journey through the State of Missouri, and was accused of being accused of being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recently published report by the Office of the Office of Missouri by the Office of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers are more common in the state 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"the people must be ready to bring Caucaine or its relatives to travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "Missouri was recorded in the year 2015 100 Hasselt, after the latest figures from the Hasselt's report of the FBI, which regulates the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country." ""</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse companies because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona, after the States have adopted immigration laws to arrest people because of immigration inflicences, which will contribute to the development of ACLU for further filing.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have deployed the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The subtle project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezvn project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU out of the CDU White and Kordula Kovac were a picture of a picture taken on-site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the rectangle of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fishing bacher gathered together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann bestows first insight into its operations in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" is for him the alternative marketing course for milk of his cows, as Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the table of the Feria-stallions only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also called the BLHV-chair of Fisbach, he described the fence as "elementary-important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit up on so steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, much needs to be edited with the engine sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and the topography" "", "Schwendemann emphasised." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the elongated operation and used the management of this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the deception project and is happy about the leader of the" "" "Leader" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers had to be supported at a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the orying of the areas could be moved quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and making thoughts about how they continue their operation," "" "emphasized the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in criticism for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is thus 40 hectares, which are not permitted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total costs of 71 500 euros was funded by the leader, a quarter brought to the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Consequently the farmers had to invest 12 billion euros that had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and countrymen it does not go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter White stand: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The policy-care policy (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of women fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the closure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr drawn conveyor track.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the unheated area may not be bad (slopes over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened with confidence.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fischerish crossover project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area covers 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking off the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it, when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciated this as well as any other - hence the sort of staged fall of Saddam Hussein's Firm place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regimes, certainly knew what he did when he took an axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have caught him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their importance, and especially the meaning that you was attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta complaining: "I don't want to go back to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... an American freedom that shines the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance on Lazarus, the only ones where a state does not only invites any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "your troubles, your poor, and your suppressed masses which are looking for free to breathe freely, and the wishing trash of your rich coast."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Truman USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who used to make their words after their death at the base - knew quite well that they have completed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicans in making them a classic representation of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they are themselves a different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a disastrous attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change it long from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not united, but rather an early Neoconservative, who bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry out the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch shall not shine the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual, Limbaugh is tossed here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great terrific fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the true sense, to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome you must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is obviously not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wanted to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine the way, but hatred that is their only source of power to ignite.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidate, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butine, who can compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle from the team became a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her capitalist speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were met in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman was at the team Lee McConnell.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block by critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office when you do not wear the dial-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from the Domestic Policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He imams in criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For the year 1783 Washington said: "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupidly and dumb we become like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">It brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on it more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and deleted, which expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained of it this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-action with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest ranking of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand at the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and debating his hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come on the page of the Governors - which is a public forum, is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse commended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trout or spammers or hassent people who swinging the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer's Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not satisfied, but she asked to hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I told politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news," she wrote in the comment on the news show "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people responded to the same subject, they are considered as a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what employees of the Governors" "" "concentrated Spam-Attack" "", "others would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut off a message by blocking one critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time, when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect, burn, burn, burn papers or protesters to silence and to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this just happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public civil servants who is criticized for his Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors, the Loudoun County, last the first Amendment, according to the U.S. District Judge, James C. Cacheris, in Alexandria, appointed a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time, Washington had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers had been varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters beat down his guidance.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius," wrote all letters to newspapers that make Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents produced by the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put it into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of expression, opinion, and discourses belong to our nation.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery-Areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, July 16th.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can enchant off this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The salvation and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stressed: "it is a unique grievous small od."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuscelle was first mentioned in the Württembürgischer Lloyd Book, Count Hermann of Sulz and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the Word, after standing on the Tumlinger mountain, apart from the Parish Parish Church, a gorgeous courtyard, too, belonged to the church or patron was not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, along with the Lower Village and the Oberdorf, who today are still visible in the outskirts of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the manorial settlement center of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 signatories these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronatsright arose from the early medieval suitability.</seg>
<seg id="477">One Lord, who built a church, remained with a priest, and remained with a priest, and was able to inherit it.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to use a priest or bishop of a new parish.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church, two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell appeared in 1692, but had to be released after the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were stewed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was very dense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and churchwares out and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to topple 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilfiger-Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from listening to Hörmann.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery expanded and the Hilariusher church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year of the year 1834, a storm split the storm and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today, the turbulent tower remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "creative pensioners" as a successor by Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>

<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers are hoping for many supporters to the obtaining of the historic St. Hilaire plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörswiss.</seg>

<seg id="504">Society intends to examine permission of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim restrained itself" sees no legal requirement for building and has therefore turned into the Landrat.</seg>
<seg id="506">The club "Boisheim" denied with "Boisheim" has encouraged its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved, as at that time in Viersen only existed on the city limit to Schwalmtal a wind force concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration area, construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration-zones causes a exclusion of wind energy support for the rest of the urban area.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are to prevent a "savings" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although the town of Viersen had a second wind force concentration in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier - which however did not allow the district government Düsseldorf, because of a formation.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "the lack of approval is the required approval decision, as before unlawful and therefore," "" "Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim "" "." "" "</seg>

<seg id="518">However, they do not expect that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With a view of ongoing processes in the administrative court, the circle on Thursday was not going to appeal to the argumentation of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette to build four meters high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company in which the City of Viersen has been involved in the town of Viersen, was concluded with its owner of approximately 65 hectares of large land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind energy plants, the power demand of around 11 400 households can be covered, which is equivalent to approximately one-fifth of the electricity demand for all four-grown households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Foursens urban resigned a green light for buying three wind turbines at the wind farm Linnich at Aachen and a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>

<seg id="1404">When his staff managed to keep it several times, anger from him, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it, that Trump controls are calling.</seg>

<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the Committee recorded work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote under appeal to the people trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper opened the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified its investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1484">US intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin to have targeted in the 2016 Presidential elections.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller is examining whether they were going to vote between Trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">There are several men in the focus of investigations, who acted in election campaign as advisor of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the magnifying glass.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special-mediator Trump personally wrote in the center and undergo the accusation whether the president might hinder justice in the wake of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand lawyer's main task is to examine and decide whether the indictment is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Thus, Grand jurys are called the mersal chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when larger and controversial cases are.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be switched from the public prosecutor to charge persons under Eide.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, CNN counted proposals that turn around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons who were involved in the meeting were prompted to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. did Truman advisors and swimmers Jared Kushner as well as his associate Paul Manafort with his talk.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the objector show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he should be necessary quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it must not necessarily mean that Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the reduction of the committee from the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something changed, it was called in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>

<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate also stands under voltage and could dismay, if at a key place a slice.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeira and Eisberg does not raise the sea level, as they swim in the water, and ice as much water as it gives to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the Schelfeat leads to the glaciers directly into the sea and much faster can be flowing as before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low measurements, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfestival is the fourth largest Schelfestival in Antarctica after AWI-data.</seg>

<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems, which one did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a real "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, a high number of employees, disease, or age-conditionally, comes from the service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is high time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter is the leader of the CDU, with his party even beyond the joint application.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He has long been in the crayon for a fat-thick surprise when he publicly posed the personnel charge in question and startling the rest of the parties.</seg>

<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently pre-written, increases or more money there is only if one changes in a higher level, which orientates itself to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be furnished, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute legislation.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightened the tone of NGO migrants rescue booting</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has NGOs working the life-boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue their operations for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs sign no new code of code, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Home Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin-based daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German charity organization 'Youth Ruttled' because their crew had effectively worked with hands-traffickers in a way that lightened illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which is in operation only since one year, refused to express itself as detailed allegations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we can't operate at the moment in the search and life zone," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all the accusations that are currently being raised, after we collected all the information and evaluate the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rutt', the Iuventa, who has been monitoring the Iuventa since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes slotboat migrants aboard, delivered them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can drive them, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such additional reunion took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutors, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of suspending the authority of Italian coastguards, the rescue paragraphs in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives to impose.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of behavioural, boats such as Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and life operations have so far been agreed to hold on the code: save the Children, MOAS from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessarily, but acceptable to no "fundamental changes or disability" of their life-related activities.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign themselves is the Nobel Prize Laureates Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti said in the meantime, that the number of migrants who arrived at the rescue measures in Italy came heavily in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastal waters and the cooperation with the local community of fruits have carried away.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan Citizens in this month's economic development and with Chad, Niger and Mali, to reduce the number of migrants to reach these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened with climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of drought conditions and considerations for insects, which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, make great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural Research Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change in the past few years, who brought much less rain in the spring and much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium, the dwarf, and very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there's a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil spends not only for holidaymakers, it is also in demand for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant watches with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either weakened or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">To the solutions that are considered in consideration, a better water distribution and deepening of evaporation belong to the ground, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of flavours, which are resistant to dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce weekly meet in wednesdays in order to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state Sinaloa by the organised crime, corrupt civil servants, and unauditory drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what makes it safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a tablet on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose a name for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach-feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug interruptions, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the administration list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no resting periods of violence, and throughout the country, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto announced his office in December 2012. 589 on attacks and threats from Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and their aspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake it is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will feel deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice." two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, trauma, its nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a sonic of the Federal Prosecutor was built in 2010, in order to edit the cases of journalists, they led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderer of journalists are seldom stopped trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still have to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable, although the terrain is still avenged.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know this, we suspend all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the 12th river.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archers drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly free in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But the theme of Valdez, there is nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans have been arrested last year and the extradition of the country had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country because rival factions are struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone can be shot or more people on the road or that the cemetery is full of knotted, two-story mummasses for drug trafficking, which are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rival board fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication might have been offended the sons, suspected gangmembers bought each copy of the output as soon as she was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error occurred in it, Valdez does not force to force the same story after the seizure of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and its killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues to imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noriseste in 2003 when he joined Riodoce to the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism, without hesitation it," "" "Bojorquez said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">The newspaper engaged in a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took part.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to publish hard treason without fear of censorship, and the readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories that no one dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">She was eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the committees for the protection of journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they went.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you must take over the task of getting to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done so much? why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missing Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar over from the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine use?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like if you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their home starting and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-care and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones. days previously known that spyware that is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen searched for the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in scherz, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described governor for themselves as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago, since the reporters went into the mountain region where drug coders are facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce spends on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the brother's former boxing scientist Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé of the government spending, which focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that has been in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write, that everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug trafficking and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that ruled all the century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal begged the reporters to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one who escaped the son of "El Chapo" a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago, readers were considered Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body relief.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez rubbed a couple of signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning because of a further journalists to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become loudest as they have written in organised protests "SOS Press" on sideways and construction.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists, because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked that she is divided again by the government, because she is concerned that their anger has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a gender society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters not only be killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the past year, the Media-Assembly group "Articulo 19" has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die, because they want you to hold the mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Societas-Kartell: "here I'm because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones in addition to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to continue like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly founded the drug cartels with an editorial board on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home states, or even out of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armored hereaters is the best preserved fossil species of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Radio when he took part in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that appeared on the plateau, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in the Royal Tyrrell Museum.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground pumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only flush a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has been sleeping," said the main actor Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creation is visible.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily damaged dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves of predatory animals, used a paraglide that is also known as a non-burial, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to soak up in its surroundings and soak up his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature out of the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contershading, a widespread defence method in animal rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shaded is usual, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today living.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was chased out of enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution profits as a means of survival as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the Contershading - think of deer, zebras or belts - are much smaller and vulnerable than spoils, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor.</seg>

<seg id="2003">For the "Comfort check-in" works: one gets up in the train, calls his ticket to "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">With the test customers a button on the electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train drivers have a message on their mobile devices, that passenger's X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Comes the train conductor when driving ticket control to place Y knows that there is a passenger's already-made online ticket there.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"he just wants to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying personnel, check out the DB Navigator just myself.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows the passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal "says Michael Peterson, Marketing Manager of DB Remote Traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our staff have more time than today to approach the individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel, know that besides delay and passions, the ticket checks are among the largest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">For often, in any case, one of the participants do not require any documents you need to use online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document must be submitted.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between traction motors and gast, which leads to worse mood in part or greater space and delays in control of your own tickets and will take care of the creative workers at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is also available on the service ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she had arrived in New York City, the apartment sat in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolls through Facebook to their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by somebody from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," "" "it called it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused when nobody else had posted the information on their feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ Theepharoah was continually adored on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old boy who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns leblosem body, which was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to tweets on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the screaming, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed, with which a policeman stand before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted:" "" "I'll all kill you..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "Ferrell remembered her testimony." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to you and that we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and life, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell ran with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a fitting crown, after Ferguson, the two had a conversation, which she had numerous times in front of this morning, "on the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson, because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not bring them away, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and tucked in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It has to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution, and what we have to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I was lucky enough to give you an experience in which she personally experienced no vestial racism, it is not unlike the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would prove her a bad service to keep them far away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists responded to the potential non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There are Ferrell and her daughter associated with a local business partner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They were prepared bags and helped to pass them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism totally changes after 9 August," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met after an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "documentary" "", "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came by Ferrell in mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless instances of people, often from whites in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently explained in an interview: "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised their votes, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area responsible for his activism around death cases.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought the project closer, along with six other native people the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as those people are depicted, for so I will be portrayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The target was not to concentrate on heeding experience - to show that it is in motion "not for a Messiah" that is coming together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she loves and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like nude," said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be certain poignity at this work and for the realization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells is repeating the role of the black howling women in the broader Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, having influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in the year 2012, identified the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement" "", "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly struggling to different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is held by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatic type of action," which Ferrell was chosen as a heart of the film because of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who raised this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is no coincidence, although it was at the front line because of a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman stands so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone far, but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Belmont is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">She still clung to a singing and she feels obliged to remember this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "Megaldahn": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation of 2009 the population in favour of advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic is hardly a cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Even on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit Gallery say: "it would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real" (Nicole Scale), comes from the other side: "do not need a person" (Siggi Bings) or simply simply: "magnitude!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the other business, the opponent will fear the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be designed precisely on the grounds, on which the farmers market stands, in which 13 direct marketing of their products offer.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The work will conclude with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher will want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Beda-Platz, with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers were very happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery will arrive at the height of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but this is unlikely to be low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping basket in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shop stores are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">However, since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the Market Hall remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer, and is really cheap.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop stores are hired only by larger firms, because there are people often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special shops are almost no longer there and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Most of all: where should the farmers market go during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery has actually happened at some point.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create the bit-bit gallery, to drive all shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real estate market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But thanks to the insane market, it has no more space thanks to the insane person - as I find - sensuless building projects in Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2123">If the peasant hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, that almost weird the same - that hang about cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and hair-sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret services analyst deployed a 35-year jail sentence after she publicly made diplomatic messages on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August, A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was co-efficient in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a dissiptive dissidiary, which was converted by Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA, which could look like with those genomical data, a sharp, though something intellectual comment is not only to the formattability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 because of 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white dafie, in which Manning sits on a driver's seat, and a platinblonde woman wearing - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of their 2012 project "Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigars and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg for a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were apprehended to invalid within two years, over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book "Suppressed Images," which would like to transform a future in which the President of Chelephorticism would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning would ask for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas City, a welcome way of happy meeting was.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also the opening of the exhibition a little deep and strong, because Donald Trump leads a war against informant from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways to fix them further.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, it said that things happen for a specific reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one of the art's art, the art's art statement called Manning with their superior signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic smashing, whose foundation gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequency - a thousandmark of Cs and Gs and As, written in graphite.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to demonstrate the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), such as astonishingly similar, at least in biological aspects, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what kind of people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective it are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works is from 2007, Spurious Memories." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an independent room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she emerges with a free release in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, like King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "when it comes to cold your speech, then they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so don't stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was presumpy in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed into the middle of the room of the masks, from their own genomical simulation, which coves like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, as all in the exhibition until the size (5 "2, Manning Stem), which had been written with a pencil group of genetics.</seg>

<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company which shows at a glance, which units have the most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so that you can check out why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture, you do not need the next utility to be involved in scandals, which has been an ex-employee, who has been published a blog post since then, with those who have spoken is punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for an overview a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent bad behavior and recognise, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the heart of Misskredit at the beginning of this year.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convercent Company can send custom-made "Puls-" surveys, confidential answers in real time and view the warmth-cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report with the employees of bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is badly treated or relethically, it can experience precious consequences by consumers boycott, worker fluctuation and gages, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures, and a simple way to achieve its corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no possibility to pursue the problems of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now since the company Convertible uses to have problems, who were previously sitting by executives that were still sitting in offices in cities or countries, such as discrimination, harassment or inlucients, quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can come closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who derives the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders in employment and disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to rester Ethics, Values and Employees-Commitment in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to her right" "" "that companies realized that you did not prevent her dirty clothes online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture Capital Investors, which both have to start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convertible received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the whole capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitters secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, and set up his total financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">This investment is hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex in research that shows that today's staff expect more than expected.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only wagers.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepting and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that feel their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then feel more strongly committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience in LinkedIn which both are Convertible and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve rendering when their portfolio companies are doing well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools are promise by third parties, commitment and commitment to the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless when the manager of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff after your feedback, it can have a expectation that change on the way is.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't get enough, or not at all, the disappointments and employees can motivate them.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the business management company Kotter International, the company which has left to very focused on the collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow employees," "" "Do you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And whom do you not care about, why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who passes through the monthly staff polls, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees it was to reorganise the decision of decision and quality of communication, to reorganise multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company will always receive new insights over the staff, and it hopes that for a long run, this leads to a better commitment of workers in a industry that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you will lose customers.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the Scotney Castle in a squeeze music video was seen and Margaret Thatcher was a canophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-he years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cozy headquarters in Kent River, and is now an inspiration for an graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshiman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," says he woken.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It's not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only reacted on the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double bed in the 1700's, which he worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is its thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters smell of smoke, because at that time they lit a fire because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect as it would be even involved.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love Archive! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is involved with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived for nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, see the archives and experience the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monstrous creatures on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle, and spoke with land-care, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" whiskey "" "" and started writing. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was not received in 2006 as the last producer, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said," Oh, cast it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent what had said: "we could mean that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch who fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all its gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man that leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's estate of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant stood in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">"" "maybe they are connected with each other?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patrons, that the family Darrell sang seven years throughout the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century, filled his own funeral by filling a scoffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his Sarg was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: 'the gentlemen seemed to be a great gaunt, and again debt and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">In other generations of Darrell-males, their school crises in giving rich old women, I put it to me as a lot of well-looking guys, with a talent to promote landlocked. "</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the motion of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees Erdogan as an instrument panel.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Up to 486 people who have been involved immediately at the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara following this week.</seg>

<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unvague in the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the General Staff, there are concerns about the increasing "Islamization" of the Army, which manifest itself among other things in the repeal of the secession of Soldier, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the wholesale accounts for the army and security forces will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan suffered a further 7395 casuators, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed like, then, Erdogan is tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals were earlier considered to be the real gentlemen of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In times, she appealed to her role as the Guardians of the World State Order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan suffered the power of the military step back to step, not least under calling for the reform of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 can't be traced back in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the range of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, freelance professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take its ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the company will deliver a lot of it, and we'll see it much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex-dolls have developed from their inflatable partners into robots using a silicone that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt to its robots "adapt," and select everything from the eye-colour of the robot through the shape of the flipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still more troubled that many robots have the "personalities" that would be a progressive woman in a progressive woman.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex-dolls have evolved into robots using a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robot to the properties they find, for example, relentative.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relentness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the site of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she may like what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">It also has its moods throughout the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be tired of being fixed on conversation, or she can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the substrangely female characteristics, the allegations of rape when you go one step on Frigid (is here: resisting) Farrah is getting worrisky one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish, or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its Origination and its increasing refinement prove on something dark and Tieferit in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equality of genders to a desire for sex with submission as an optional adding.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will have no sex robot, while the FRR notices its rising popularity while the FRR still remains on the margins of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what was leakening out of the fringe zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive, until they give the free market to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a period in which the rights of women are threatened by women, in which there has been an President in the White House, who has undermined women sexually attacking.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic pictures, the closed body and emitted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment, this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Her builders wanting to feel human being, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to their "personalities", robots don't pose a real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can not separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background history, nothing, suggesting independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Mumps core performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney for the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary of the trump era that the political divisions, which have polarised the US electorate, have also divided families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest celebration, there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump selectable relations.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We were all told us all to make our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-headed poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visiting me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship, having fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">It is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it appears in a further connection that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the grassy way that our cookies won't be replicated in one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a difficult long-term scenario in the trump Republicans of the right wing "normalized," which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a decepitome of deception.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of the crazy dog - the dog in the Autodah, which looked at 14% of the income tax (but at least did we know how his tax returns) - both occur in comparison to trump in fact in a very mild criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="2443">But Central Park-Carussel is still a strange magical experience here, as there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women to go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked them.</seg>

<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it's the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip money - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only contribute to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to move personality into a situation in which no needed is.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (Inflamed Daring)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based protein and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases could be left.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flaps, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers found the essential amino acid Tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patroate to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in food, will not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body, without foaming sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is inclined towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was noticed that a kind of tolerance promoting immunodeficiency in mice that carry a specific bacterium in its innards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needed Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan varied diet tolerant, less inflammatory bolic group, if the same system also work on humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan, a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found out that a group of students who had such cells had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspects that the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The glances of mice were found DNA sequenced, and there were six bacteria species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they lack the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment so they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers made L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then survived small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerant-tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component has been cleaned out of liquid, it turned out as a byproduct of tryptophan-metabolism which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells decreased by approximately 50 percent, but when the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant-bearing cells such as mice, and that most of us should protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri found the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2864">The page of La League likes to regret your interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Saint-Germain will not leave in her persecution of Neymar after having given an offer of £189 million to cancel his freewheel clause, but have you warned Barcelona three years before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has been heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers salaries of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious via the way that Neymar has forced his way out to the outside, although a source close to Catalans insists that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But the football world was warned of the PSG president three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2870">As a Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best player from PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>
<seg id="2872">"we respect all the clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign one of our players on sign, this will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish organisation put an interest in the PSG-midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow it to leave the International of Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona was able to feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2878">Police Schramberg, Phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for information.</seg>
<seg id="2879">An accident on the B 215 between Stolarau and Leese looking for the police witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="2880">Because he made a car in his lane to the track, the driver had to soften and touchscreen the drafting of a VW Touran.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg Loccum was travelling with his VW at 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolarau in the direction of Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of Stolarau, a passenger car was contrary to him, so that he had to turn right to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">In this context, the Touran drivers touchscreen the overlap.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "domain-atzen report lists Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domensatzen report to the abuse of abuse by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means authored and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse of abuse at the Regensburger Domnick atzen continues to discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissen, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication across the German Press Agency, he acquired by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very much for the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express its deepest regret about its own underings or their then false estimation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican Council "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in the coverage of violence against dominion with "two different measures" will be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Concerning the encroachments in Regensburg, no one knows that it would have to be prevented and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committees.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habits, the Catholic Church, as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experiences and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated in the interview with Bavarian Radio: "we are happy to go to the Church and this is a big fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "in addition, she pointed out that in her youth," "" "saw a totally normal educational means" "", "" "" "with naughty children, as I was one to be ready" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They were unfair to apply today's standards on earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse often, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger was often dived.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely to injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger, wrote the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report, which was presented by the Enistum Regensburg which he introduced to the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 shelters permissions were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plundering" victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summarize that Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms forms of physical and mental power.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Due to high Emotionality, the punishment for students could even be heavy.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Contrary to numerous other signories, many victims were estimated to be the general humanity of R., and in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann said, why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domnick atzen Georg Ratzinger has relieved in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in the shelters" shelters "is a contradictory picture taken by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Many students lift up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For others, it also appears as a choline and perfectionist, which was used by the economist when a cathedral set has not brought any top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you use this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">At him, eight pages are dedicated, and he is clearly acquitted of every suspicion of complicity or compassion in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the violence processes at the pre-school event took place outside of his action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can, too late, learn it too late or to have first suggestion not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The cathedral momnasium, on which he worked, was felt from practically all respondents as "redemption," "Heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The broad majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent witness, describes him as "warm-hearted," "competent," and "understandable," as highly goodly teacher who supplied the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bondons, and "always surrounded by children's grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about its perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which also led to wound breaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he had not only knitted with chairs and threw the keypresses on the ground, but also earful boys in the hair or ears, he has already been deeply regretted, deeply regretted and apologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">However, his honorary deliverance must be said, however, that such education methods were widely distributed in the fray era, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents like in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think anyone of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually goes in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, are the free bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">It is already asking if it is not to do with his acquaintness and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media had just thrown onto him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him would still be zealous.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report entails Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, there was a lot reported about the topic misuse at the site of Regensburg.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report about any processing or complication in sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no, no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual violence claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem at Enlightenment of sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral person who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How is the job-atzen-students Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which he had been aware of (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... also for a really absurd to assume that it is equivalent to him... bben as an obtrusive or even more abundantly, than compared to their parents, internator conductors, trust instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - thinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in the advance affected people and / or their surroundings, the investigation could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">This is concerned about sexual abuse, so Georg Ratzinger is free to speak about every collaborator.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to put his good name together with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, much of "Nondiscrimination" was to be read at the Domensburger Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of "looking."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the great problem, that in the coverage everything mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Yet exactly this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separately: between preschool and secondary schoolmates, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as we say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, incidents of incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral restors of the domeshiker.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases where the boy of savidist teachers were wrong and malnourished, all were all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly skilous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he didn't get the boys only to face when they were already on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was on that, like the most witnesses, the subject "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domicatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was no discipline there, but no savied violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many of the victims of the general humanity is estimated, and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So, at most, the allegation remains a throw away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Yet despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods where it was reported from the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and began his predecessors at a school where he didn't work and was responsible (such a witness), and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Is Georg Ratzinger floss the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domain chamber, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he shows this, "that in the pre-school, the test will continue to practice."</seg>
<seg id="2965">He felt urgent influence over the risk of negative press coverage.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was also banned in Bavaria in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as everyone knows how to know.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate that those affected are perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where actually the allowable limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">It just doesn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test case for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed, it was unfair to apply to the current educational standards that time to time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "Fallacck of Anachronism," so the danger, the past to today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this obviously does not apply for sexual abuse, who was scarcely in all times and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children, that is far beyond the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awesome and I'm glad that it will finally be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means to the punishment and punishment of punishment, i.e. earchers and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then it was forbidden, he also strictly kept it to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What is the picture of his days of regain, Georg Ratzinger has been given the book "My brother of Pope" in talks with you?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the issue of examining magnitures also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, meaning Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the cathedral sparrows played only a triroll.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I didn't feel at no means that he led a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without these perfectionism, without any unconditional discipline, it would probably never have been possible to form a institution of world trans, true cultural ambassador Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singers as well as every success, in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks to their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann said: thanks to the work on the book and beyond, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, low-believing, deeply believing and warm-good people, you could not imagine that he could only do a little bit too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I receive regularly with how many former dominion is still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him to visit him, read him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until now, that he was once hard to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domains are thankful to him today, that he enriches their lives and brought the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vainful teacher, a stumbling father, certainly, that may be - but also a loveable respectfully, to which they still look and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one accuses to him are educational methods that were the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and one more prominent brother has to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that stands behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the anachting areas, a 93-year-old man who had gotten himself great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know not yet one of the Regensburger Domuns, finally in peace.</seg>
