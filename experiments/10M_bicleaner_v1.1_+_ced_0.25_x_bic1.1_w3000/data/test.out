Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now understand@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in dra@@ wers , or I get stuck from the outside label which have a little bit to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I myself have not the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot;
to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the Sport@@ py@@ rami@@ de
his experiences on the horse are horri@@ ble .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a variety of colleagues with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses had remin@@ ded of their holiday evening , they pursued the quick gal@@ lop to the house .
one kilometre at this speed , I &apos;m afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the hor@@ semen ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses .
he left with his family on the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he won &apos;t go to photography .
it was the first time in Aachen , so it was the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports help handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala with Golden Sport@@ rami@@ de .
and does not lack the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men .
Federal Reserve , silver bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen left him already .
long is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid of trees .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
this award means a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes young talent .
and so he continued the prize money from 25.000 Euros .
with 15 more outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US master@@ class winner was induc@@ ted into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot;
among the flags of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ven , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ an , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the pioneer Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the Pal@@ b@@ aller Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sporting activities came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively company moved into the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , un@@ just the two US presidential values are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the one , about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against such as the State of the economy can harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to ste@@ er the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , however , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will go massi@@ vely , and makes it strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open and needs money .
for this reason , taxes would be increased to the rich , &quot; she says .
Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
the latter has to be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ sen@@ ing .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party of the Republi@@ cans .
so on tr@@ ump , there could be part@@ n@@ ly internal discussions .
clear@@ er are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power plants and drive the coal extraction in the US again .
oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas so that he plans to cancel the Parisian climate agreement .
Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment programme and requires : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of the clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not just in infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the self @-@ fish trade agreement , they both don &apos;t want to sign .
at the same time , however , both of them want to is@@ olate the U.S. from international trade but simply protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , calls to Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a star@@ ring .
it wants to increase it up to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in that question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says he should not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to spur growth .
his critics keep him ahead , that the budget deficit would only be bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who want to ask at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each baby has a baby , which is only a year old .
she placed her little son in the arm .
he looks curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother st@@ acks on the tabl@@ etop .
until they notice it is being monitored .
she sm@@ iles and kissed the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
it is the division &apos;s director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social packages in Bavaria , and it deals with the subject of women on the escape .
the four women in the kitchen are vol@@ atile .
they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ conditioned women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs merged the furnishings with pro family and the Munich women &apos;s aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - not as visitors alike .
the exception is an wa@@ ist before the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated : every woman who comes here has lived on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are t@@ ort@@ uring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; torture or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they send them to Europe as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope to look for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are ste@@ aling away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sive , hon@@ esty , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
and that drives them away .
on the run it continues .
&quot; the tu@@ g for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who , as soon as they should come to Germany , believe that the end is about danger .
even here women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and worst .
this leads to some 90 percent of women living in the Munich North , trau@@ mati@@ zed and under@@ estimated .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so familiar to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the awakening , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t get to help , there are more accommodations for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
on the question whether they have been using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers some with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women should not be accommod@@ ated separately , Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer says , press pre@@ ten@@ ers of the government .
in some community shel@@ ters , underground and middle fran@@ ken are available in some dormitories or private homes for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately .
in a study published in the committee it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can lead to - ongoing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shower room should be easily accessible and accessible to women easily , stands in the study .
how much the women feel the need of this need , you can &apos;t read it , which there will be at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily create a second house .
resident custody strikes : recei@@ v@@ ables after new campaign measures
Deputy Members of Assi@@ sten@@ cils have called on their union to appro@@ ve new action in dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more integration measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the Ministers would have failed to deal on the concerned about the contract .
Regist@@ rar and Media Collec@@ tors have voted in July on the ref@@ usal of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; be@@ consistently calm &quot; on problems whatsoever that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requ@@ esting official new negotiations for all your pro@@ stitutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board has set up a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work towards the beginning of September .
the disp@@ utes led to Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ sts to strike six times a year , the first total failure in the history of N@@ HS .
following the election , the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana re@@ signed the agreed signing of the agreed contract , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance parties and media inst@@ ances that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of outer lateral &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is in receiving his Turkish counter @-@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot defend me that Ankara wants the reconciliation of the most .
there was the g@@ ale , yes .
but Putin worked very narrow and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper , that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so much worse than would never happen .
his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s shining , sustainable feelings showed that Russian leader of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the crisis of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
the aband@@ on was even greater , as it was committed by a shared friend .
the Vet@@ ro@@ en is being re@@ building up again , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a strong , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
serious accus@@ ations from senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse when Putin wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a tru@@ ce are clearly on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan is first all of his friends who he can get after spending the last month during a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
terrorist attacks on Turkey were also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of bat@@ ants that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number dropped by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agency and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they are counting on a late seasonal tower of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the Bavarian television set forecast fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish farm imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it looked at its response to the attempted put@@ ty of power than weak answer .
to achieve this , the persistent Gro@@ ll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke of it is to take advantage of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West .
Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat for the attempted coup .
this is a self @-@ understand@@ able for Moscow , that even has to change a deeply sitting fear of the regime .
the summit in this glorious palace located in the sea , it enabled Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analyst at once , &quot; Alliance of out@@ sides &quot; : two countries that have viol@@ ated the West and are badly treated and al@@ lied with .
nevertheless , despite the public pro@@ pi@@ ti@@ ation , there are still big differences between the two .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support additional pages .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks on the press conference , both pre@@ sidents affir@@ med that they didn &apos;t even seize the issue .
the president of Turkey avoided it deliberately to answer a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear con@@ sensus on what a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect Dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey lost the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of states talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role , according to the Bank &apos;s head office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago .
at this time brand offensive &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now it has decided to press more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B are references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters , and the IP@@ Os to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan has been interviewed during a inspection tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand and the brand that our staff will be busy as we are now able to become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we have no global goals , but pursue local goals .
each of these stamps , in their own municipalities , will stand for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship , and that it will enhance the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , as we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Executive Officer .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , when we had said we had been a great bank for our customers and launched these trademarks .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ins Champagne after a double at New@@ market that brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track , with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is also here
I &apos;m very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
Lester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ys@@ ers , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career @-@ in @-@ goat
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey on modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , just a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans already for this sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already taken 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekend and grand@@ neph@@ ew !
Frank@@ ie has suffered almost 30 years winner , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British flat ren@@ dering for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of great tur@@ ni@@ ers win , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug prohibition .
three years ago he had difficulty in difficulties when he returned from his six months of semen , but showed an impressive strength to de@@ fer his branches and to return to his top shape .
and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said he wants to continue at competitions up to a minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia &apos;s Chief of Staff Ser@@ gi Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the nar@@ ro@@ west trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin explained that Putin had ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was deputy of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn , Tall@@ inn , in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo .
on the site of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it &apos;s ( in Russian ) that he was later de@@ struc@@ ted and Vice President of the Government .
he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support its activity as head of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
find out the smiling fac@@ ets ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ Ivan@@ ov had long been one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest collabor@@ ators as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced , especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this .
but the official asser@@ tion that once as a potential president was praised , a man who wants to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed for a great scep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks at Putin , which are cited in the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - one could almost say - to have confidence for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB &apos;s Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted in most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov had become President of Russia &apos;s second term . as a third ten@@ ure of Putin was forced to viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post has been taken by another , obvious allies of Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ View Cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing with the vi@@ adu@@ ct which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ per@@ missions of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 shafts .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go into the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is an historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering with a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the passport .
in total , nearly 79 % of total bridge trucks are in their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets a che@@ que for the deck , which means that the whole Deck will be ready to be lifted to its place .
Michael Martin , project director of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the sh@@ utter @-@ proof high @-@ quality and deep @-@ construction .
after installation of the last road cover and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close that gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pulling in the northern part bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very fin@@ ick@@ y business .
massive , because the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
if the toler@@ ances where the team works , they were tiny - on each side , it was only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot;
three men have &quot; good luck to be alive , &quot; having been thrown by her fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty going to swim in safety while their boat moved away from own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turns around and turned the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat apart from their range until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from age 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board of the coast @-@ saving boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have got happiness and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the motor vehicle had a emergency stop@@ over , this however dis@@ b@@ anded the boat off the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone over these men are w@@ aking up today .
seriously injured - man stir@@ s up to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had received the key to get his personal stuff .
instead of the alcohol @-@ corro@@ sive perpet@@ rators , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when this came into the flat , he stab@@ bed twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and in the body .
the police could determine the perpet@@ rators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
these al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother together with her partner .
but she could not move it , however , to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her life @-@ endangered in the house .
on the street , she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women stepped up the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old created his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Brown &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens answered : investors should become much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 in the next few years ?
the SPD suggests a &quot; manual concept living &quot; to the next rat@@ chet .
but dispute is programmed .
first , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
one control is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD faction Chair Christoph Frit@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the gre@@ enery : those who want to build on urban areas must be 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the affordable housing can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main point in the town hall was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such areas at least 10 per cent , but 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments build . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new city housing program , which will cost millions , and must be financed , shall provide for inc@@ en@@ tives .
the problem , as Brat@@ man : &quot; there is still no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left will still want to take hardness to investors .
regardless of , as Brat@@ man , p@@ aving a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the manual concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration .
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program isn &apos;t completely complete : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments were to be built anyway .
how does one compare the loss of further 1300 inexpensive apartments , whose funding is going out in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into the price bond .
that is possible in the western city .
on a strike the problem can be solved .
because at the end of the western city , Fri@@ sten are running at the end of the year .
around 1800 dwell@@ ings could be found there in the price for cheap apartments .
only : they don &apos;t want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social apartments in the West@@ stadt is again dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the aim of the so @-@ called mixed mixture .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak areas in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; S &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more grounds for single family homes .
but what does not mean , that not even a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s fascinating , how the world is changing .
that teenagers and child are not going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time outdoors on screens , has been pro@@ claiming in the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , people are about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
the screen at the screen was at the beginning on TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activity do not exclu@@ de each other .
I refer to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app which was based on the characters , which were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later , it developed a animated series , playing cards and other sp@@ in @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in front of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smartphones go out and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined W@@ ahn and jum@@ ped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps caused by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; person &quot; &quot; &quot; every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ac , an app for Apple Watch , followed by the 35,000 users , shared the Washington Post recently , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , who jum@@ ped 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it simply looks the rough data to improve performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public clari@@ fication campaigns for the health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threw every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on deaf ears because many public emb@@ assies are boring by people who look at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
whoever drives regularly , reduces his chances to get cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing that Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered , exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friends .
however , there are also oral gam@@ em@@ bers that must always compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
a breakthrough has happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new one will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , because of Po@@ k@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and to be ch@@ asing with many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for the combined events and extended the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team c@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt the pig @-@ bal@@ ken during the single campaign for women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American player who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date its reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment .
it succe@@ eds in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought up their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es dominated their sports art in the last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , who have a mixture of ambition and precision , that she said , &quot; The best gymn@@ ast is that I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to be a final examination in Brazil , a contest that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a hand@@ ful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after winning gold and silver in the single multi campaign for women at the Olympic Summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday and won .
Bil@@ es won the first coin on Tuesday while she served as a clamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team @-@ party coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top , never planned the future , that &apos;s not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is based on Latin American music , which would suit the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , was put into force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost a multi @-@ campaign competition in the summer of 2013 , a victory of victory that will continue as long as it wants .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turns , the picture dec@@ eit@@ ed .
pig bal@@ ken and bu@@ ds - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - listen .
they went back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig &apos;s bal@@ ancing again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still a one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected their En@@ der@@ ial - a pure form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ red on fine red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in their collecting book , became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke in Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ulated , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their ground , she over@@ threw the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ volumes , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seems dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as regards Bil@@ es , so quickly the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in a car incident at the car in the car
according to police reports which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , which occurred in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial production of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot dead on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in an entrance , the authorities said .
the do@@ ers fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon , while he was on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , to read the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , since the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police pre@@ ten@@ ers of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led to investig@@ ators , whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
predominantly in His@@ panic attacks , 7 attacks were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that susp@@ ects several vehicles used , including one brown denom@@ inated out of the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to determine the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are tied up and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised with its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness , the police informed that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on shooting g@@ ging , which was carried out on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and assumed that it was the work of the standard m@@ ör@@ head .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball out of the seat and ball frag@@ mentation from the engine room .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his anti@@ quities , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I can &apos;t create that .
I do not create this .
I didn &apos;t let on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not correct at all -- of course , it is settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband was informed that Edmund they could never recognise them under circumstances and that he may not survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to be institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I did not know the people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can help with the help of help .
he could not sit neither sl@@ um@@ ble until his third year old nor yet he cannot speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
he can run and cycling with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Edmund created for &quot; Please sing me a little before . &quot;
&quot; we bring to him a drawing language , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical sign language -- it says . Edmund invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a wide range of causes : genetic as with Edmund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it is affecting the life of the cor@@ on@@ avirus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds on the emotional price of a tremendous future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I did not ask for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the cor@@ on@@ avirus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , flood events on b@@ ail@@ outs in Louisiana , Mississippi
violent ra@@ ins and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to pro@@ claim the emergency , on Friday . it will reck@@ on all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Rhin@@ pp@@ is flooded their sho@@ res and threatened with wide floo@@ ding in extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National We@@ ather@@ Service .
the governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards distributed that state officials are standing in permanent contact with the local authorities and had assistance to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor &apos;s Office , shared that requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather Service ordered that additional 3 to 5 inches could be falling to rain in this area .
in the south of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will likely reach all odds over the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many homes in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream of floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers will only flow slowly in the Mau@@ rep@@ as Lake .
the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi national border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams are still adding people from the flood in the area of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son , were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet to be removed from his house , by night strong increase .
he said that another step of step@@ son who lives near , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and put in in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was my wa@@ ist .
his wife , Hans@@ ford said that she lived in the 48 years , in which she lived there , never had such a high rise in the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he was the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that remedi@@ es had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread rapidly , since there were still heavy rainfall , and the authorities ev@@ ac@@ uation transfers into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ servers near Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the floor has been a lot of over the rain since Wednesday .
the authorities noted that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ding inhi@@ bits the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the instruction in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a sub@@ or@@ derly lies in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now flooded so now .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed from floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were furnished to host the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the community Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed on due to the flood , which we hope to hold the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems like a similar incident .
in Te@@ pp , the emer@@ gen@@ ation manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Harrison called , said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday have been reported as over@@ flowing , but there have been no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; Made by balls , &quot; survive shooting in Philadelphia
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identi@@ fier him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several gun shots , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was at his transport in hospital with consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was extingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ des@@ z on the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family distributed to the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four who arrived in German@@ town .
three men were recorded too : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two cas@@ u@@ alties are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , an@@ gled , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police just identified if under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had come to a cross@@ roads between several arch@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ es of the assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been tra@@ ced to different assault ri@@ pped the crime scene .
it seems that there is definitely a lasting battle here .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were inside .
so there seems to have been several armed fighters here , which were very actively involved , &quot; by police det@@ achment Anthony G@@ inal@@ di , police in Philadelphia .
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
there was no ass@@ ump@@ tions and the police have currently reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket , when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
they are re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I introduce myself under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ ship in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that from more than one reason .
first , I joined every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspi@@ rational for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ kin is off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the US .
it has consolidated the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the head of this sport species .
in the last four years , the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ship a Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
with the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the unbelievable achievement of the triple world champion from Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ m@@ tik@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ ages throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie put all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison one to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last five &quot; as the next Olympics will have only four turbines in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that Tur@@ ns a more expensive sport is and Turner will unite the first line in private gymn@@ as@@ tics which are maintained by parents , which are responsible for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) .
the majority of these Gy@@ ms lie in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these verses , Turner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , train@@ ee of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both its athletes since it started with the tower .
we have to be inspired by the churches of Au@@ n numerous young girls who inspired Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible gymn@@ asi@@ fication .
I founded my Turn@@ stiftung of 20 years .
in my events we offer free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will exp@@ ire to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics to get the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ ative for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is so exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thank you that so many young girls motiv@@ ates her way to start their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organize more strikes after she has rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
the Ministers had been hoping to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ alities of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Assi@@ sten@@ cils , which voted in a vote , refused him .
in July , Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the Treaty , and said that N@@ HS could be united in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance of assistance should receive a new contract , which includes changes on night and weekly work to improve the maintenance times of permanent clock times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A coma for Assi@@ sten@@ i@@ sts divided the last night in a message with &quot; Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ sts , &quot; in particular that it will heat up the present current crisis and to handle all doctors . &quot;
for only eight weeks , still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by BM@@ A to the disp@@ utes of disp@@ utes ar@@ ising during the government to participate in the government &apos;s dispute and sometimes att@@ acking silence at times .
this was done by a speaking that Jeremy Hunt made a last month in the last month that his door would always open .
Jeremy Hunt must now act now to raise the up@@ side down and concerns the assistance of assistance . &quot;
if he does not do this , the Assi@@ sten@@ i@@ sts have made it clear that they are willing to perform further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 termin@@ ology , as nur@@ ses and doctors have been involved in order to grant physicians on the strike chain of Dec@@ ision .
the Ministers had been hoping to end the dispute over the amendments by the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called for assistance to help end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration measures can reach nothing of the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing and their families only cares , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the Com@@ pati@@ ee of Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ai@@ as , and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es positively respon@@ ding to the concerns of gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ity and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employer hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important issues - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , training courses , mutual recognition of the teaching , education service and the health ministry in compliance with the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May were accepted .
the £ 2 per day medication which can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ iting from a £ 2 per day medication , after having been recommended by the authorities , to date more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ular drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
this medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
regulatory Authority N@@ ICE ( N@@ HS ) has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
regulatory Authority N@@ ICE ( N@@ HS ) has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ial walls , which form the pads .
if the layer broke out , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that inf@@ lic@@ ts the flow of blood to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots draw@@ backs , it can flow through blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who had already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk to have another risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is exp@@ elled under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ bable .
the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Insurance Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke , often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
information about the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the management bill recommends not treatment that goes over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ ri@@ ness leaves voters to blo@@ om in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ a Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption in office
a culture of Political Cor@@ y@@ ness has led to it that widespread choice was ignored in Muslim communities as a devastating government report .
the former cabinet of Sir Eric Pic@@ kles inter@@ acts with the police , election ob@@ servers and town buildings to have ignored the evidence of poll@@ ination due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former minister for integration and communal government , which now is a scandal of religious motivation so bad that the police should be allowed to set up the police force outside of election cubic@@ les to protect against in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should take an identity card to prove their identity in the elections .
at present , a elec@@ torate has to name only his name and address .
the report proposes , not removable ink on the finger of a person , when they give up their voting voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should obtain more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community materials and decisions of un@@ official comm@@ ent@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not only serve against electoral fraud , but is also to protect the communal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ toral Area in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the reig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man should be enth@@ r@@ alled to corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ tes .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ance of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation by which one person cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - where the elderly members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the watches of evidence to prove identity
in his report it says : &quot; as a proof , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in accordance with the will of the El@@ derly , in particular communities of Pakistan and Banglad@@ es@@ hi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions ignored such a behaviour due to &quot; politically in@@ correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists tend to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , being drawn by Ther@@ esa May in consideration , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the suff@@ rage of immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options , elec@@ ting voters off the choice after your identity .
not removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once they released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications on an automatic letter .
ban , that political activists work for a letter and env@@ elop@@ es .
the police give the powers to lift off voting stations .
a change of the legislation , which was facil@@ itated by the Act of the People Act 1983 ( national law law 1983 ) .
photographer and ban on election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training , to ensure that the employees rule out that voters go alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; surprisingly &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets .
&quot; the electoral tribunal found Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his pro@@ xy for a lack of corrupt and illegal practices as in@@ comparable , &quot; he said .
it was due to a number of reasons for the reason - according to the high demands on the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check check@@ box &quot; of the election divisions of the City Houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court rules in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country is a proud heir to the mother of the par@@ liam@@ ents , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten these good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler &apos;s double @-@ per@@ secut@@ ors and other famous bi@@ kers from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are held this week over the French cycling team Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot besides the edge and band that has proven to be an impressive double @-@ rank of the Duke of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic in this summer is by far not the only one , around the golden Ath@@ let who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you give the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently fli@@ ck@@ ered on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists at Olymp@@ ion@@ aries , which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
except K@@ ates double @-@ rank on the cycle road , many people on the Internet showed how a certain arch@@ ers of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
in fact , the arch@@ ers had the mad@@ ness of mad@@ ness in the social media and he had to hear that he had already been listening to his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the face @-@ hair@@ y , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&apos;@@ er is a good @-@ looking guy , so let &apos;s do that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur in the centre : the most striking simil@@ arity between the British broad@@ caster Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eye is intended to go through as a double @-@ singer for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a speed higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actors .
another comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal for Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ burned skin and bl@@ on@@ ous hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan has attacked Adrian of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about others the simil@@ arities are also fallen .
theory in space : according to this user , there are perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason .
Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter has an incredibly similar visual appearance and eyes .
another popular reproduction of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her sm@@ iles , which is almost identical to the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , and the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , that resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off when he flo@@ ats its own views at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Back@@ l@@ swimming pool .
Mac@@ don@@ ald was brought to board the C@@ BS on board team to give more &quot; color , &quot; and could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like Mi@@ ef , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ru@@ ck which enabled the Canadian to complete the gap to China .

Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane Twe@@ ete , &quot; Has the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot did not act that they were still on the show . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described for women with the fin@@ alist 4 x 200m for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to put him many on his speech .
Twitter users did not move back when they heard how un@@ ensi@@ tive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you are just presenting the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like ra@@ mp@@ ant . # numbered .
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming pool . &quot;
it was an un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it is happening . &quot;
at the end of the last 90 times , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for people who have answered the emer@@ gen@@ cies of Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald .
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we regre@@ t@@ ted it correctly , that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast them .
yesterday we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at our viewers and our followers in the social media .
to put one of them , Byron &apos;s comments relative to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not in them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and un@@ fortun@@ ate chosen formulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday , Mac@@ don@@ ald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the broadcast and trying to justify his remark by telling that it was not his intention that she was working as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympic race , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have taken care of the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not in them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regarding , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark disp@@ at@@ ted by woman who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to see her , when a woman pulled her clothing in the midst of a priest , to try shelter .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mut@@ tered her as she looked at it and put them back to the shelf .
she sticks along and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tested the under@@ pants before they put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the store , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , she went back and the business left without buying anything . &quot;
she said , &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
standing in the middle of the retail area , she took up a pair of under@@ pants , gradu@@ ating from her own Str@@ um@@ pf@@ h@@ osen and tro@@ users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply was there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each star@@ red , when she moved the lower abdom@@ en , which you obviously didn &apos;t like to please it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , attracted it and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone watched - or about the person who would buy under circumstances which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how do you agree that someone would take care with her home who had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I did , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pede@@ stri@@ ans to go home and find out that another woman had she had and didn &apos;t have washed her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone was un@@ conscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect ones@@ elf with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com might make him safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to get around with armed pre@@ aches .
regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or back , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ ewer .
if you come back from behind , then you should turn up as the first , so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and enter &quot; yourself from the Fire line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
pull the gun then between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free el@@ bow .
kne@@ ad it with the kne@@ e to the body and rotate , while the att@@ acker is so@@ aked in pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into your face and move on back@@ wards , while they do the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching , the technology is similar - move your body from the Line of Fire , seize the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker is not to shoot .
head out the weight on the gun and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving forward and make the weapon on him .
sounds easy ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ set .
but remember that with a ra@@ pine on the saf@@ est one is to submit your money - unless you are not a Kra@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue on the dirt spots in Europe
a British journey inter@@ rupt the immune system and thro@@ mb@@ ef@@ lex of a serious test - marking some of the hum@@ bl@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the host and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk scra@@ pped his course on a Euro cas@@ ein , a rail@@ ings at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button in Russia as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system .
before removing every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer , in order to show and let us show on what it is settled .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the daylight .
the thought , the dish@@ wah@@ er kno@@ b of a tractor toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely disgu@@ sting , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sp@@ ula .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical experts on promoting intestinal bacteria , as well as on his own health .
fortunately , nothing left , which he li@@ cked , more than a bad breath in the mouth .
Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intest@@ ine by travelling around the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to stations up to dish@@ was@@ ps of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health affects and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and lu@@ dge . &quot;
in the film he was definitely just right .
the only thing he dismissed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test line showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ esc@@ ence number is freshly made hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their L@@ umin@@ esc@@ ence count increased more than 4000 units , while freshly baked hands have a little less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce Vali@@ o produced the travel il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial numbers at different locations such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the worst thing I &apos;ve joined in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not mist@@ aken here , because it &apos;s inside it inside .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new .
something that is fascinating , and at the same time explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings which ended with it , that we said , &quot; Let us make ourselves Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have liked my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have directed to it , just like the lav@@ ish Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to fet@@ ch them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of respondents were associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent that they have at least occasionally use products containing in@@ sufficient lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

after being for@@ ci@@ bly removed from her man@@ or , shocked employees of the residential community found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were scor@@ ching holes , wooden floors were torn down , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed to live in a private accommodation now .
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears that the apartment was no longer a repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I &apos;m convinced that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to take into consideration because this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its call is also .
the couple had three sons , which had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terrorist who had attached the family , stre@@ w@@ ns with bases , abuse of abuse , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug abuse and excessive cry , stre@@ ches and flu@@ kes included .
Skel@@ don , 47 whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be demolished under conditions , old garbage was found
they were tra@@ ded in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor layers
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and the police had to be called regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ged them and her partner these week for@@ ci@@ bly from the estate , after they gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
one said : &quot; they were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived for 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we can tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
now , where it is finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had to co @-@ operate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called for regular intervals , 20 years
on the secured side of the house , garbage and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it hat@@ ched the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and the family , as a delay is always the final step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , who have cour@@ ageous to us and have given us the information provided .
I hope that this development will don@@ ate comfort to some neighbours , and the message is convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedroom of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation dropped on the floor .
workers of the house administration are now occupied by garbage bags that sur@@ round the house
in 2014 , the police triggered a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and guards , Par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine of fine , after it was found guilty of a drug in a drug in the case of a drug .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in an accident accident .
once they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were honoured with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says she is ten@@ sion@@ ed to susp@@ end ten@@ ants , who do not think of the house@@ keeping order
Angela C@@ row told the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants which do not comply with the house@@ keeping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they may behave differently , as well as to those who were har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti@@ social behaviour that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tr@@ ump dre@@ aming ″ tremendous problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans have pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now the weak@@ nesses of his campaign in the existing republi@@ can stron@@ g. Utah .
a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dent .
after having thrown 16 rival within the Republican camp from the race , now is the doubt of his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said before Evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt are false reports on his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sites .
republi@@ can high bur@@ ds w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June 1998 , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes may look forward to the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the federal state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the CN@@ Y CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump on the question as he wants to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done it so far . &quot;
and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything else than you tell the truth . &quot;
if there is no rich for him for the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness of political correc@@ t@@ ness , the tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present a better demand .
rather than if one would take the candidate of Republi@@ cans for Congress more than the arms .
Olympia : thirteen Sc@@ am with D@@ oping test
the IOC plans to set up an event commission on the event .
Ken@@ ias meet threat@@ ens after the second D@@ oping affair during the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
after an attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with immediately set up a national commission in order to investigate the case .
a ken@@ ian function@@ alist had told that the former Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine test named F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i in the Olympic Village in the Olympic Village .
this was the Team@@ manager Ken@@ ias reported by D@@ oping Con@@ trol@@ le@@ urs .
the International IA@@ AF world association gave the IOC about the event to recru@@ it their own research , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man shared with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the examination and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; called it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and has issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the sample of and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ ias Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the athletes who stood on the list for training controls in the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan Athletics delegation &apos;s leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is alleged to have informed about cash payments from his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya is at the IOC after numerous d@@ oping tests have been under special observation for a longer time .
in the announcement of the IOC accepted more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the visa .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ Start .
subsequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya took place from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control with the rules of WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD has always been le@@ ased out that in Kenya D@@ oping funds will be easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
IOC member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study on Kenya as he had asked them in the Russian field of athle@@ tics .
in this way , it could be demonstrated that in this sport area , it has been tigh@@ tened and systematically .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with him a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ einer masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth camp .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted under the Venezu@@ elan conducting Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is war@@ med .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older than Mary .
she re@@ members her love with melanch@@ ol@@ y with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it &apos;s exceptional musi@@ cally !
and then Mary &apos;s personality is still .
she says in her song : &quot; I Fe@@ et Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I @-@ Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is smart , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I used as Roman &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dud@@ amel is full of praise to the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour to work with her .
it is a terri@@ fic man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his gl@@ ances , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temperature , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ atism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want to .
there are the same topics , and they are today as seas@@ oned as then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died after their family shortly after she had pre @-@ leaving Land to return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that are associated with it to go into a war zone - People will ever stop this decision , &quot; Ak@@ in@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school@@ girls from the east of London climbed from a plane to Turkey and subsequently went into a bus to the Syrian border .
sul@@ tan@@ as family was informed that they have married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton will nom@@ inate Judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere , to deliver an 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .

in the beginning of this year , the Chief Editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us in the beginning of this year that his nu@@ dity @-@ magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes itself as &quot; Playboy &quot; for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classic con@@ d@@ iness , in which both women and men feel good and inspired by this pictures of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ endars . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and engaged in Erdo@@ gan , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ ready foundation in dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in short notice , the Kurdish parish of Germany anticip@@ ates a short term with tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , there might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the attempted put@@ sch attempt , the Kurdish parish of Germany expects a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; at the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already attracted Kurdish high bur@@ dens with pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kurds are on the run in Turkey .
after the failed coup attempt to add se@@ cular and opposition ethnic Turks .
many will start in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in their own land refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Commander of Commander , accused of hos@@ tile Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic towns .
with this , Erdo@@ gan may increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were already eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Government demanded that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
in Germany , there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I didn &apos;t feel safe in Germany last months for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks overseas .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ elle .
the fire market as Gü@@ len pendant will anni@@ hil@@ ate teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics to professional existence .
&quot; who is not fitting and Erdo@@ gan , is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ ready Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper under calling on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks already set the largest group for asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all patients accepted as well ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , you do not find out about war , poverty or perspectives .
asylum claims according to the Basic Law are politically , thus from state side , individual followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get any of the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
the Sunday election will not again take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Assembly has already decided at the beginning of the year .
but , as far as far as it does not have : summer holidays , heat and land@@ scap@@ ing thro@@ es - that is .
the locals who are to be convinced by the elec@@ tors are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not any natives , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they come to practical problems : in the vac@@ ations are hel@@ pers , the posters that hang up , fl@@ ashes , fl@@ yers , and fl@@ yers the end of the vote , apply only m@@ üh@@ l .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and final day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to wait for a campaign close to the people .
the hot stage , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition that must fear his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now in p@@ olls clearly behind the CDU .
what is exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains in the end of co@@ ali@@ ent construction .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age , and his head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as well as his predecessor to his predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Merkel is the blame for Af@@ ro @-@ blo@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will now cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right time on the right place of election campaign .
she has invited Angela Merkel twice ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s federal government is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Sax@@ da as Mec@@ kl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity to nobody to listen to other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the nor@@ theastern CDU remains largely on the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
this means co@@ ca@@ des , plays only a &quot; minor role . &quot;
the Union , too , has noted that in the country her base must crum@@ ble , that it must be very strict to find a wire back to the people .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there are in the borders of the country .
however , the Council of the CDU electoral co@@ king to its Mit@@ terr@@ ors is , however , self @-@ de@@ bearing : &quot; you have to go there where human beings are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
because much in the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD now to an especially committed campaign .
in the p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group finally fell by 22 percent behind partner CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD still clearly won 3@@ 5.6 percent prior to the CDU ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens Green Party , with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will probably make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holiday @-@ need and make their choice of choice on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign &quot; is known as the President Claudia Müller .
otherwise green electoral violence on track ensu@@ ites according to local stimul@@ us are among the holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top candidate , cur@@ vy just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ine lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay .
construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south at the yearly beginning , until the end of October was supposed to be finished .
at comm@@ end , the oppos@@ ing of persons responsible for the construction work is comm@@ ended , even if it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ein@@ ises .
since the construction site was transferred on Monday to the south , and the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was removed and the connection to the Rot@@ tenburg Castle is also relaxed , the traffic situation has been relaxed inside the place .
now the citizens can operate from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the exclusion of exclusion through the place seems to return .
&quot; there has been some significant complaints , &quot; says the responsible senior management of the refurb@@ ishment responsible for the development of management of the main office : Florian King .
the residents of Bach@@ ar@@ ach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ er@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many shots were seeking and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to that some trucks in residential areas have been fran@@ king .
as the speed lim@@ iters were not observed , the community intensi@@ fies the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made up the location on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the way with 77 km / hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it became qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg are now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B @-@ 27 @-@ renovation has led to sales in revenues , everyone who is asking you can look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is , of course , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cat@@ ch@@ as@@ antry is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the strongest , the local paths are on the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , the owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Kron@@ a , finds clear words .
that is already existence threatening .
not only him , but I hit all the guest places &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil failed .
we have to be glad about every euro revenue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue rises to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street perform@@ ers have cast their operation &quot; around two years . &quot;
he had to put the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , the policy would have acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt thus respon@@ ds to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation , the inn will benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it also has to dis@@ advantages the dis@@ advantages caused by the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other country circles , where something more generous .
in all claims , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , the family business was already set up here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
so that other regular guests are now able to store less frequently due to the complicated public transport .
if you can &apos;t drive out , it is also somewhere else .
that its ec@@ lip@@ ses come back to the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its customers &apos; clientele , which has experienced its place in many years of history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
continually , in the name of counter @-@ terrorism , laws shall be screw@@ ed .
according to recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now establishes a thick safety package .
but what has a Dul@@ id status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner tell all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package .
they are demanding no one .
others , more further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also involved in it .
however , as interior minister , he was lying on results and a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition .
after recent attacks in Würzburg / Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère , having a little time , he presents his conclusions for the safety in the republic .
but now the more extensive are falling .
some is already known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the pack of encrypted communication is not new .
also , the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements to passenger data and arms .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies is also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère takes a second start for proposals that have not been doing so far with the SPD : he wants to make sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and wi@@ pe jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CDU man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers this to be reasonable and nothing at all , whatever in the coalition partner anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas show@@ cases de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
these are partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for shifts and more possibilities for dep@@ loying people in front of the deportation .
refugees who are picked into the country , should pre @-@ check their smartphones and show social media accounts for a security check .
for asylum seek@@ ers he wants to pose some even worse than to date - such as such , off@@ ences , or have been deliberately throwing their papers to scra@@ pe their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
it also works un@@ balanced and makes questions open .
and with some points on the im@@ bal@@ ancing of Ged@@ bers , for instance , the question arises : what does it mean to do with safety and terror ?
yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
moreover , many people were worried about security in the face of high refugees .
and things that are deeply ap@@ preh@@ ended with people , did not let go out in election times .
the inner safety is stimul@@ ated in the focus area .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
and yes , it is standing att@@ ests .
the Union and SPD domin@@ ate the topic of internal security increasingly in position .
in the past few days between the two parties went up .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Unions of the United States , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also working here to reconc@@ ile tones .
from a return from the double pass he considers anything .
we reduced the discussion in Germany .
you should make sure , be not meaningful .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ prohibition he has constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is necessary for the coalition partner .
there is quite a lot in it to make war .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ claim in the issue of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the party of Part@@ mar Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled in a careful discussion and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing the security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still going through .
despite diesel and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
in the return operation , it is about a term .
Volkswagen launches in the deliveries in the second half of the year .
in the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer , despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , can continue to prove a plus .
but in July , the core brand VW introduces above all in Western Europe and thus loaded the overall sales department , such as that in Da@@ x recorded in Da@@ x .
in July , the brand sold the Volkswagen brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles compared to the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany , deliveries increased by almost one sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , led the weak@@ est figures back to Europe less than two sales days .
in addition , in some core markets , there have been &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; to make a purchase back .
in addition to the situation around the attempted put@@ sch attempt in Turkey , the British vote suffered for the exit from the EU , a speaker explained .
in the US , where the com@@ bat@@ ants first escal@@ ates first , another Min@@ us is also up to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the primarily affected house brand in Lower Saxony is further lim@@ iting through the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extradition of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is charged .
in January to July , the Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales growth .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen calls approximately 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the upgrade of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bus stop to the customer after conversion a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I don &apos;t talk of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in the Company districts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be the legal rul@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen ex@@ its its German customers now a guarantee for new diesel models now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the regulations of my Commission of In@@ quiry and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; differences of these are not accepted , &quot; Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has taken the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power after the upgrade does not take any deteri@@ oration and all typ@@ ing relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was called in enterprise issues .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that clients come about half a year after conversion with a engine damage to a workshop , and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in Customer Inter@@ est , it is important to avoid that any damage caused by any other damage caused by any guarantee of guarantees in terms of guarantee is how it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands a second institute in Germany in future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is possible for 139 customers to park 40 million euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily cas@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Association of German Banks speaks of a single accident and does not see in it no signal : regular savings would not fear to pay for their austerity complaint . &quot;
store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay her 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee is required by the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund in September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily cas@@ ings .
&quot; the first € 100,000 is free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been in existence for 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and could not be able to use it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me is 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank of Banking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t put it for every million 4000 euros . &quot;
the cost he continues , according to the fault of the principle .
it would be too dangerous in the che@@ ers of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank , it would have been too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four accidents , I could not have the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank account .
most clients would have understanding and change to other suits .
only a few moves to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the design@@ verband Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB caused considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you alone contribute , &quot; business @-@ economic durable is not possible . &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or credit transfers .
the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land made headlines in 2014 with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect that private clients need to pay a wide coverage for deposits , in addition the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a clientele , which is a little sum@@ p@@ tuous from the wealth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it bag for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the G@@ mund established in 1911 was founded in 1911 in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ operative association &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calcul@@ ates a storage set for deposits of private clients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Federal Association of the German People &apos;s Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold , to go to the Individu@@ als , is very , very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of June . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the competition was hard , and it threatened the emig@@ ration of investors towards competition .
customers in Germany would not have fallen below the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who is buying records ?
lon@@ ely men mean age groups love sheets .
before you come to the comment to over@@ take him under the p@@ seud@@ onym non@@ Al@@ le@@ Al@@ le@@ men &apos;s aid with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ tudes of records of records are not seen on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to greet the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but attributable to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record have been fore@@ seen before the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older flat@@ ters retain their emotions rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while I keep in the midst of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest gray suit and wild gest@@ ure before I stand still keeping my hands and have a bit of determining as : &quot; so , let &apos;s throw a closer look . &quot;
so , let &apos;s throw a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os is slowly standing on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were based - are there still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to eliminate the camera for the next part , in which I stand up close to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I asked Sister Ray ( number of data : two young women , three male middle ages ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data count : eight men of medium @-@ age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates .
these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed by him ) , dressing the walls of his sitting room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income is : it is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy it when she was selling , when he was young and ple@@ xed .
&quot; many things I buy are out of the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
it is true that those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend alone in time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my button .
We@@ z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray , believe that many customers that he meets with the You@@ Go@@ v @-@ profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have led to buy their old albums again .
by the conversations that I have led , people usually have off@@ ended their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their panels to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to recognise that record stores offers a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ ations .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers start the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and want to return to stability of confi@@ ded records cover , from objects which are happy acqu@@ ir@@ ant vig@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or property of material poss@@ essions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z .
this is as a collector so and I think it &apos;s so many people .
it is a simple way to deal with intellectu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red@@ dened a staff of a stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M revealed in April that almost 50 % of the people who have bought a plate last month have not yet been heard .
the pol@@ l also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ az@@ ing a pil@@ se of Bos@@ sa Nova compilation .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just returned here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ tables , but I would like to buy a radio plate , so I &apos;d like to put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a great percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music cl@@ as@@ tig .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which only come slowly .
opp , which has been dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a poor audience than I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teenagers and women middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ lich@@ ter Pop , instead of experimental jazz dr@@ am@@ pered from the speakers - is it good to see such diabe@@ tic .
none of them look very lon@@ ely , but brand mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable if you stand for about 30 seconds in addition .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes in business and consider the variety of plates available for sale .
she rather makes a sh@@ ov@@ el bum@@ ble@@ bee than a big one .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore the collecting of records is no real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a really loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the licence to mu@@ ck the je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young te@@ ens to group up for a moment with Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left , there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essenti@@ als for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to write them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry , and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the most suitable for luxury goods such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the B@@ um@@ meln by Train stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves , while the star@@ ring look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false comm@@ ent@@ ator who stands out about the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ eless men of middle ages .

French court re@@ jects offer over demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live , settled in .
during a hearing this week the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should carry 72 provisional stores in which persons inside the camp products , from cigarettes to energy drinks , sell , hairdres@@ ser services and sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and medical risk .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals that supported by the state @-@ supported association and other groups are not enough food to provide the growing figures in the camp .
they led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there is no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but cleared a fact that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture will be totally neg@@ li@@ gible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food shops , cafes , and restaurants would play a much larger role , as only people live , who live &quot; in extremely pre@@ conditions conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly used as well as 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice to asylum causes for hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied minor age in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .

like a lot of money for the take @-@ over , Microsoft shared not on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and has already more than 100,000 users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can watch others by playing , but also interv@@ ene .
for example , they can give players missions , and opp@@ ose enemies as well as equipment items .
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
Facebook is expected to help on the global media event .
the advertising industry is already running .
staff of Start @-@ ups , which has its headquarters so far in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Red@@ mond , like Be@@ am &apos;s co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
so , for the customer , we should not change anything through the takeover .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video player , according to Microsoft &apos;s video player .
the Live @-@ Stream &apos;s Market is currently growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by the online retailers in 2014 - for nearly one billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google @-@ Mother Alp@@ habet .
here comes the en@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation of vel@@ ocity : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new lighten@@ ing devices will be tested , the temp@@ o of the game should effectively perform effectively .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic in@@ separ@@ ating en@@ forcement trailer of the firm Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance on accident areas where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on motorway fl@@ ask or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary leaf for maintaining the speed limit .
a durable construction , however , can be too dangerous or consuming .
the en@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operations , the case data are transmitted via a modem .
with laser @-@ measuring technology , all vehicles can also be detected on several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed lim@@ iters , as well as a transmission network according to time , road@@ way strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly @-@ driven state , one can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car cl@@ utch .
in order that it is not easy to c@@ ater , it is lowered to the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and also fl@@ ush @-@ proof outer cover will disappear .
a built @-@ in alarm system should also protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashes with the new technique : recently France has added 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by , after he brings master@@ class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by came to a corrupt stop during the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated by a score of 43 @-@ 7 in De@@ odor@@ o Stadium here in Rio .
Fiji divided a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , cr@@ ut@@ ches , scheduled race , and ro@@ wer strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color .
the defeat was sunk by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall to them in the final .
but regardless of this , in this form a 15 @-@ man team had failed .
it could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not be - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : fi@@ j@@ is boss coach Ben Ryan , the former chief for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult way behind him .
she lost Ryan every game eight years ago with the Adelaide Sev@@ ille .
here they lost only one thing .
this sli@@ pper will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji had begun mira@@ cul@@ ously and caused the attacks of GB@@ S from fun shut down .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au attacked in the corner .
with just four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack in the right corner which he turned .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely has the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle Drop Out Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but it could only be stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua l@@ ete in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute play time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ broken through a further weak tac@@ t@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is like it would be born in Fiji that 7 to play while GB still allowed .
it is that way .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova had gone through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game went long in favor of the southern se@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans che@@ ered , sw@@ inging and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to see the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame made the i @-@ dot the dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ ff finds , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB k@@ ick@@ off cr@@ ushing in the lawn .
early on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals of 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a cris@@ p half @-@ fin@@ alist from the race - Great Britain converting the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton took the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thereby the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fight with the cancer of the train@@ ers victory
there will be no less than gold than in those games and what will be called .
from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 hard drives that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ im , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the train@@ ers Robin Williams was more present than they left for the second Olympics in the two without control woman , the first women in the history of British sports that laid such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9.@@ 8 un@@ stable use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete who slide over the surface with the elegance of wit@@ ness@@ ing , reflecting not the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind every gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on is content to content contributing to the difference which make the difference and it was not easier than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had the bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and that did them .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could be treatment early 2014 , out of season , which could start the inter@@ ruption on a minimum , if such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ entive .
I was in the hospital and running at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ toxic@@ ity of victory , their initial idea went to Williams , who spent a irrit@@ ant morning so that he was trying to speak anything else and thereby trying to process his own fears .
St@@ anning who was the cent@@ ur@@ ent of the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week a emotional wreck . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it is so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would not have a better person for coaching or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join forces , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were really caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to let themselves rest .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions on his future .
bell must be on a wedding next week , their own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
London took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years to be exempl@@ ary for clarity
the managing director of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is considered &quot; Bavaria far &quot; exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small , soft drinking water purpose , as a model for the large water producers .
so there was some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a Bavarian Radio post .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia were promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sailed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all the Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , who was 31 years of employed employees , 28 of them as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants .
members of the church are the churches of the church , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
for further cities and municipalities there are water suppliers .
the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller was set up in 1985 as a Wasser@@ wart , and was appointed CEO of the Pur@@ itan Federation in 1988 .
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they stretched out from water management and maintenance activities on office and organis@@ ing activities , the budget plan , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency notes on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchasing activities in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the restoration of the high tank ( 1999 ) , the new creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partition of water pipes .
there have been no lac@@ tation and I always resum@@ ed new innovations , because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio she praised G@@ ö@@ hler , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he worked with a lot of heart blood for its purpose @-@ purpose , and he has lived for the purpose of water , as if it were its own company .
a few weeks ago , he considered to present the success concept of the vac@@ ancy scheme for the nit@@ rat@@ ory reduction in front of the Aqu@@ atics district of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
the Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller , on hand , praised hydro@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best waterfalls and he was a loyal killer .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view , he described the well structure and re@@ structure of the twin federation .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were due to the quar@@ ry at Kirch@@ hof on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages with water could be looked after .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can only be maintained only because you filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches .
the management of the drinking water purpose was delivered to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds from Ru@@ pert G@@ ö@@ ller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ rebellious ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine has made big progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease was diagnosed with her son , she believed they had to die .
however , the eigh@@ ty @-@ year old Ti@@ ago had come forward and moved to New York in private , where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to give an example : if I sang him something for two years , when I sang at La Scala &apos;s Mail@@ änder , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoot at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man arrived in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) and wounded them fatal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself and stated that his partner have been shot dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police maker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator may be on the run , and after him it becomes public .
meanwhile , since Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned , and has a gl@@ at@@ cher .
meanwhile the police released a photograph of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man we@@ ars a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with themselves , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , the 110 is going to call .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victims were born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
in Lübeck , the police in Lübeck had not wanted to do any information about the ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; at the moment we do not say , &quot; she said a police maker in Lübeck .
according to witnesses , a special police unit ( SEK ) was on the crime .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ based German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional cost in millions of stones .
financial loads that threatened the industry from the green power fo@@ stering are from the table .
it remains at the liberation of renewable energies in the emerging markets in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday , Friday ) .
&quot; I &apos;m really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had planned to set up the steel producer , which use gases in the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel sector threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there was now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Com@@ mis@@ Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this in the steel industry is not raised .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on its own production .
this means that the status Quo &apos;s status is largely re@@ written .
the Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts have a particular significance for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is the future &apos; is that a first step . &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt , also stated in the reform of the emission of emissions , &quot; says IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt .
the steel sector in Europe has been suffering from excess capacities and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producers in China , faced with the weak@@ ening domestic demand , threw considerable steel to the world market .
European manufacturers refuse Chinese steel concerts .
over the course of this spring , the situation felt something relaxed .
the import of import duties on imported effects , for example , have increased economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear , how sustainable is the price relaxing .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
most recently the prices were more stagn@@ ated .
the sector re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
however , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp initially wanted to exclu@@ de any works of individual works .
at the end of 2015 , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increased orders .
they produced from 3.4 million tonnes to six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the steel association was divided on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the out@@ set went back the second month after the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the Association reck@@ ons in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , Spirit , health : singing the senior well
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied all her life . when young girl was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
quite by the way , she does something good with her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is equal to several perspectives : a great hobby for seniors , also Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German retirement home .
most senior citizens sing in a choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular mer@@ its , senior citizens can p@@ opp@@ ose and maintain social contacts .
because frequently solve social and family structures in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to talk and organise themselves to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the most part . &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever requires his lungs regularly , doesn &apos;t get so fast in everyday life .
even when it comes to get the sound of voice in the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , &quot; Ursula L@@ enz works from the Federal Employment Community of the Seniors organisations .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher job , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them .
L@@ enz often proves that singing or listening of songs in older people are w@@ aking up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and particularly melo@@ dies , people dis@@ infected ones@@ elf in de@@ men@@ ing@@ form of self @-@ lying events .
in the singing , the head also demands special power , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , do not only practice themselves to concentrate themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in a choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in a choir .
to show itself : if I try for something long , I &apos;ll get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
whoever wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you are not singing - at 50 singing people , who hears , when there is a clay to it ?
looking for the matching offer , seniors have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle in a senior ench@@ anting person , you can simply connect yourself .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
if you want to sing in a church choir , you can turn right into the church or the church .
many veter@@ ans &quot; fans can also be found on the Internet .
those who have no access to the Internet may ask family , friends or neighbors for the help of the Internet .
those who want to sing , should necessarily connect to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something free - that is true for every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a boy on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which has the effect the calls of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they always kept the difference to the females always .
female cats can recognize the ar@@ ous@@ y of cat bab@@ ys on the th@@ a@@ wing of the little ones .
they respond to Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens , ten percent faster on Lau@@ te von K@@ itt@@ ens , who discovered in great trouble as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
tom@@ cat also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the th@@ a@@ wing of less and strongly inv@@ inci@@ ve for the male , either not per@@ cep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published in this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already figured that the duration and pitch of the K@@ itt@@ ens terr@@ ors diff@@ ers with the drums of their assistance .
nine adults were observed in a total of nine adult males and eight samples from the MH@@ H animal life .
they were played for a pet of small children , taken for three minutes from the throw box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of stronger cat@@ ches , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample for meaningful .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had its own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they swi@@ vel faster on the loud@@ speaker , when this calls of the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be an@@ born or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males did at all react , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men in baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women react sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ ologist reported to She@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
already in the suspension of acceptance after the attempted assassination attempt in July , the government accused the everyday life of norm@@ alities should not be imp@@ aired .
however , this does not apply to those who are suspected to join the exercise of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
football is not just done before the football .
the prosecutor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the earlier Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
so , in the meantime , South Mor@@ avia is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ch@@ r should be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
while the emergency situation is valid for a period of 90 days until October , the majority of Turks do not have any effect on the life of the most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ Wa@@ iter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sport is - like the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and enemies .
traditionally , fans of the fan@@ club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are not counting to the friends of the President .
but what the Turks do about the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict ref@@ usal of military put@@ ts .
even the fans even agree , regardless of whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at the winner of the gala &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be coming to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Köl@@ ner exhibited its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; rejo@@ iced him : &quot; he was the best in place . &quot;
he completed the season in an outstanding way and secured the trop@@ hy for his crew .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season was found for a con@@ cili@@ atory graduation .
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League say the &quot; lions &quot; say early in the Europe League early .
in the sweet@@ ness of Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
most of all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who won with 26 seasonal travelers as the South @-@ Li@@ g cake , the basis for the 14th titles .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the AC of Florence , under the signing of the treaty , had only been announced at Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted put@@ sch attempt to return to the country in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; if Mario yet wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; cited the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , however , the Stür@@ mer must be ready to aband@@ on roughly one @-@ third of its estimated annual sal@@ aries on an estimated year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence may not be paid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa can not launch in Rio .
other Athletics Women &apos;s sinners can just laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio .
D@@ oping was determined about the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had surrendered to a d@@ oping sperm on its grid shortly before the games was depos@@ ited ( 100 meters of chest ) gn@@ ashed out and hat@@ ched out .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le Sz@@ ener@@ ie : with a troubled smile , she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
it was declared that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a crowd tower .
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men , who , despite the d@@ oping past , go to the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics Athletics .
he was already locked two times for d@@ oping ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and se@@ ven@@ fold world championship had to sit in 2010 , after having been proven by the pain using Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after surgery I had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ends .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the forbidden stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est stran@@ ds this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ ent .
La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , has been tested positive and 21 months in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ alleg@@ ation , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athletes were detected as many medals .
in this way , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 , nine years later , after it was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping .
in 2004 , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of star@@ ring d@@ oping and release the European Championship 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
in 2008 , the winner of the 2008 Olympic Games were also recognized by the CA@@ S International Court of Justice .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked number two of the world tran@@ s .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ ine was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world championship , indications of taking a banned dietary supplements were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman viol@@ ates - more people dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have taken sore , and was treated in the hospital , but I have already left this again .
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on are also called Austrian citizens , is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stand in this respect in a permanent contact with the local authorities , so S@@ ö@@ ll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in some 200 kilometers south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in an Nightlife .
according to police , a Thai woman were killed and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian woman , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two watch@@ outs then went high , and with the authorities , another man was killed .
from Phu@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the Det@@ onation at Det@@ onation in the near of tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , the south @-@ east coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bomb planted by urban employees .
the explo@@ sives have gone into the air according to the authorities in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct of the coast police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g ran on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
there is a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army officers Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning prior to journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves , in order to do , however , to destroy the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , stated that the attacks were not related to Islam@@ ist circumstances or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it was more likely that the bombs of the opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were put .
the authorities have received secret indications in the country last days - but they have not been informed of the exact date and the locations .
to be un@@ clear , which group is behind the attacks .
the police in the whole country refused to increase security relating to important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure district .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge against tourists .
Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following reason of well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , Austrian Foreign Ministry advis@@ es on his homepage , to clari@@ fy the instructions of Thai &apos;s security agencies .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ cl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
there is no necessary travel to these provinces after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim people .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
these dre@@ amt of the military influence in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ CH@@ A said these bombs be an attempt to handle chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody ri@@ ots , keeps himself good to reg@@ ain the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to handle the Muslim rebels in the southern part of the country for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists were killed .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is advised to the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
after several regional offices , the constitutional bodies provided a group under observation as well .
&quot; we see at the &apos; identification &apos; movement &apos; point for efforts against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; Constitutional boss Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate , the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , immigrants will diff@@ use Islamic belief or from the Middle East in extrem@@ ly way .
that is why we observe the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is turning against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; Un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; the loss of identity by survivors . &quot;
constitutional Protection in nine German states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - watch the &quot; identification &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority has closely matched the country &apos;s decision .
groups like the &apos; identify motion &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; the Constitutional Court said .
generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts , to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
identi@@ ties Islam@@ ists as well as justi@@ fi@@ sts .
this is not a concrete advertising for its own cause .
propaganda must speak emotional to people .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
at last , reports from several federal states had given reports of &quot; identification &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he did not have insights .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contact with this kind would only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - because of certain people , which are extrem@@ ly , changes its mission and extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is , if such people have contributed to the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase of final crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee rights , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
however , in recent years , we established that there may be tim@@ el@@ ist structures .
there was the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite well that further legal terrorism fac@@ tions or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extremis@@ m .
however , an exhaus@@ tive or whole @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate concerned about fact that many gri@@ ps have walked on the account of people who did not have appeared in the right scene before .
that is wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum claims are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated crimes or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people who have committed crimes committed before , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or chose the CDU , SPD or Left &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which , however , have been radic@@ alised by right @-@ wing extremis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

not always determine the Olymp@@ ian risks or world records the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro summer festival .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center s@@ lu@@ dge the easy @-@ to @-@ use s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer able to see in the TV pictures anymore .
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
then , in social networks , Hab@@ ré was then called for the vir@@ g@@ th@@ it .
in fact the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his pre @-@ race at 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
it was , however , rather his sporty figure , which attracted attention of international media attention .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old does not participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian came from a special launch of the international swimming association .
this is distributed to be well @-@ known for swimming in different countries .
as in O@@ op@@ ies most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the round .
some of the media referred him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made him fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds more than 100 metres Freestyle and played no part .
the same with &quot; Eric the eel &quot; were also dra@@ gged .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney hosted the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pass over 100 metres Freestyle alone .
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired back then .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old lear@@ nt to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Gf@@ K @-@ leadership occurs after dis@@ appointing business figures
the Consumer Research Group Gf@@ K ex@@ chan@@ ted his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returned performances came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult position of the market research scientist Gf@@ K plans that the chair of President Matthias Hart@@ mann will remain un@@ secure , the longer the successes of his promised successes .

who will continue to lead the market research institute in future , is still un@@ clear .
it was in An@@ le@@ ger@@ m on Friday , in the shareholders , at least the dis@@ appointment over the continuing restructuring was initiated in years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring , however , have not yet been seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K @-@ business numbers , each shareholder will eventually be in@@ qui@@ eted .

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cr@@ um@@ m@@ oo@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
during an accident of a tour of 43 elderly people as a passenger car there were eight people injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , the police par@@ ted .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus for a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to soak up their data according to an opposite number .
bus came to the right side of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons were unable to leave the bus , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ men liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances arrived at the state road 2 .
the most famous trav@@ eler were brought back by a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ble district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there you should wait for a replacement bus for the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the load @-@ driver and possible witnesses to report at the police .
the fees per cubic meter is from 1 October 2016 for the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World bill 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the installation in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage surcharge will then increase if appropriate for improvement is necessary .
following a ski@@ pping calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was found in the approval of the budget by the Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage plant gri@@ lle was established .
the market Kaz@@ endorf is obliged due to the legal fundam@@ entals , to operate the facilities .
from October 1 , 2016 the citizens and the industrial and industrial enterprises are made up of world &apos;s di@@ pole , new village , re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg to get deeper into the pur@@ se .
the for@@ ti@@ fications are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re@@ ten@@ ant of charges for se@@ wage plant population was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ size and under@@ scores from the previous calendar year were to be compens@@ ated .
thus , Schmidt thus substanti@@ ated Schmidt thus to establish a relatively small waste disposal for all three se@@ wage plants with a very small waste disposal , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
for example , due to the small distribution of distribution , expenses for the necessary repair of several thousand Euros would seem serious .
moreover , the se@@ wage is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the rec@@ lining period in all three plants , three plants were not least due to its age of san@@ itation and repair expenses in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world lif@@ ter , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt showed that in the waste disposal system , A@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the pump system , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and at the pond Cl@@ ari@@ est L@@ opp needed for nearly 20 years of operation the first sep@@ tic pond has had to be fitted and an additional ventil@@ ator can be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses the continued maintenance and maintenance costs were to be considered in the new Cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous lim@@ esc@@ ence in the years 2011 / 2012 is still clearly below the current level .
stone houses made it clear that at low san@@ itation in the three facilities the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
thus , Schmidt , complem@@ entary Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs for se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years have been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain pre@@ heated , especially since one could not expand the supply of the se@@ wage plant in Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ oc@@ al to expand this facilities because it is a deficit facilities .
Bulgaria marks for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % monthly on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average flow of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1,2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .

snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Effect as Asian carto@@ ons critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ ensi@@ tive against races .
with his filter tool , snap@@ chat allows about 150 million everyday users to change reality and borders with identi@@ ties on such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a character that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are uns@@ bloo@@ ded , independent tools which generate more than 30 million sel@@ f@@ fies per day .
all Mis@@ diagnosis will arrive to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past where they were accused of propag@@ ate the Black@@ face conveyor or white skin as beauty ideal .
when they proposed a filter to several users , who gave them sl@@ ums , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ ching . &quot;
they asked if this repeated controversy is indicated on a bigger problem , that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but the out@@ standing , which has experienced rac@@ ism , remin@@ ded the filters of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , grace as@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American student , whose twe@@ ez@@ ers were widespread about the photos widely believed that the filter &quot; inj@@ uri@@ ous and m@@ ild@@ ly said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the return of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ secured , but that the j@@ aun@@ dice has been pulled to the off extre@@ mes .
snap@@ chat is not the only company that this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate was crossed .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all keep in hand .
and snap@@ ch@@ ats a big crowd of young people - who are vers@@ ed in the breed as their older counterpart - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult for a user to keep un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete your Snap@@ chat account to do the same .
in an essay writing for medium and in a telephone interview they said that they believe that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in setting practices in Snap@@ chat .

&quot; either she has no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures to the diversity of his staff , pointing to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a speaking driver , the company has recently presented a staff approach , focusing on sub@@ re@@ presented population groups and on internal integration events .

military leadership dirty ISIS intelligence information , Congress of Congress ceremony
military @-@ affiliated member of the United States Central Command has changed down@@ draft information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria than it allowed the actual states &apos; conference in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the armed forces , secret services and the defence bud@@ get@@ ing , reported of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence services , reported on how the ass@@ essments were changed to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news coverage that were typically ab@@ dic@@ ated by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Commander , signed a posi@@ tional image of the American efforts against terrorism , when the actual states were allowed on site , and were consistently positive than analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , is fixed .
the leadership error in Cent@@ Com are up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government @-@ sp@@ ik@@ es have been given orders to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to the pressure of their predecess@@ ors , an optimized picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or I@@ si@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military recovery had already started in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a republi@@ can congress of Kansas , in a statement .
from the mid @-@ year 2014 up@@ to the middle of 2015 , the points of Central Command changes the down@@ stream reports to trace the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force in life after it was agreed , that analysts were worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports about the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense at the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the news post office published on Thursday their own findings , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com created a fully reduced trial for the creation of nach@@ richt@@ on ass@@ essments on I@@ si@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest ranking Democ@@ rat @-@ Committee , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. , known in an opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of post @-@ democratic reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the demo@@ cr@@ ats said , no references to an intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st have found in relation to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , which were included according to Cent@@ Com &apos;s complaints .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ ten@@ er of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of Congress during the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor still in progress .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations against the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a asser@@ tion that is now made by a growing number of relatives of the defence ministry ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have dropped out the question , President Obama has reli@@ ed on Central Command for honour@@ able evaluations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret government remin@@ ded over the Islamic State from more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , described a document of many analysts only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to ob@@ lige the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government &apos;s declar@@ ations , that contrary to the government statements made by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this preliminary refin@@ eries had been put into service to sell oil on the Black@@ market .
this recognition was not published however , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the leg@@ islat@@ ures due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field @-@ hockey women , show@@ down a show@@ down with great Britain before
one day after having shot down three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two gates in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever did .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal to their group with the Brit@@ ains in their first place , which remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within six teams .
the first placed will be a strong Dutch a little longer from the way that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising h@@ uss about their success story , four years after it landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team got everything wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work story in London , which we now have .
we have the ru@@ d@@ der completely around .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close area .
India had left the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , it &apos;s too late , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and un@@ avoid@@ able , a race @-@ run for@@ int between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is like the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is offered by Armb@@ ru@@ st@@ ers to the Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting time in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing from Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ fon@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of black with dimples , could absolutely be sent among these well @-@ known names that would be sent to Prime Time , accompanied by sponsors and chari@@ ot @-@ TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ true .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold .
the Olympic flame is illuminated not every event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow , the sports that are not univers@@ ally accepted : air guns , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may reign long .
but if I should go modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
although the trampoline was already an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been spar@@ sely perceived that many people , I had questioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic athl@@ ete .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA has sent athletes as a competition , it never won a medal in the tramp@@ ol@@ ines until 2012 , who made it until the end of the end .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for both men and Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain outer edge , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a C@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as those that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a little bit of enthusiasm .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous te@@ ats of its never to end s@@ cour@@ ing bri@@ mming - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which is as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
the winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a series of falling movements ( turning , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
according to the official Olympics , they are rated as execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete in Rio each other .
the common Olympic V@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists need to go further down in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes go back and back to the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the starting line , but in the TV transmission another one @-@ term goal : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted stre@@ ak is no@@ bel , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a viewer too tears .
but it is also what I sensitive to see these games as a little ti@@ res@@ ome .
this trampoline offers an at@@ sink .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is up .
a forward movement is not the objective .
he or she jum@@ ped off , seem@@ ingly heavy as an astr@@ on@@ aut , then down@@ wards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no h@@ ek@@ tic attack on the target , no expan@@ se in the distance , only the dre@@ ad@@ ful , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s like Zen such as the competition at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final results of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will ex@@ ert the final as part of a night event at two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to over@@ look in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase of consciousness is only achieved through anxiety and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base , according to The Wall Street Journal .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long a ally to the US
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , demonstr@@ ating political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gled on violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that tiny prot@@ esters were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia doing just together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid trade union with a fast growing economy .
but during the past months , protests against the government struck the country and spread themselves in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med around the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot down un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably taken from the past or earlier this year , show how security people strike young people with p@@ ples , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands an incoming investigation now .
&quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services are closely associated with the Ethiop@@ ian , to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded its remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new campaign in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
similarly , Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - Human Rights Organ@@ iz@@ ations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country were limited , where dis@@ sidents were put into silence .
many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , driven or driven into the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; if you prefer people and don &apos;t have any other options besides prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Ethiopia .
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints covering all kinds of land @-@ use and cover to power of the ruling coalition .
following an extensive critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border with Eritrea ; a battle for this h@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts agree that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , were forced to explo@@ it more or less , the turbul@@ ence could benefit and re@@ arm the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ors after years of age can now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , cheaper smart phones were increasingly becoming more common and improved its Internet services .
even if the government locked the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , they hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians at that they gathered themselves so much protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
since its own prosp@@ ering the Am@@ har@@ as , who predominantly come from branches in total of Christian countries , in politics and the economy , while they captured the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ lands areas .
but even this is changing right now .
&quot; we are on co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos areas .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death at a non @-@ publi@@ que illness in 2012 Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister for 17 years .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could remember corners .
analysts predi@@ ct that it was particularly understand@@ able to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contrac@@ tors to work opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime will lack this fundamental feeling , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analyst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take on the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am come from the south .
analysts predi@@ ct that he is not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the outcome will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the analysts , apparently by the government , and subsequently stolen from the government .
during the following Raz@@ or , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development of development experts Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure development , as well as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ade , as well as for their measur@@ able progress on the poverty level .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ out@@ art of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it adop@@ ts a dangerous form .
last month of print prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ u@@ rous city , owned by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred toward the Tig@@ ray becomes more common in the social media .
analysts predi@@ ct that protests in the US and other western allies bring in a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights via the neighboring Somalia , although they recently ha@@ sted that it closed this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want to inter@@ act his ally in a vol@@ atile area .
this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ emigrated . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS is a sar@@ cas@@ m .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy over the last controversy by giving his campaign by repe@@ ating that his multi @-@ repeated statement , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication threw new questions concerning the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans , whether he was able to communicate and understand@@ able with the American public .
it also brings his fel@@ low@@ soldier , which ende@@ av@@ our@@ ing to take him during an event@@ ful period to explain in the actual position , statements that he could not have meant .
after expl@@ aining the election at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he was really not intended to signi@@ fy that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he is simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to do something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS would not want to know the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate .
the last storm of criticism sp@@ elt down to Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling re@@ frac@@ tures .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the business situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
telling about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals were lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m into his defense .
in late July he attracted strong criticism when he said the Russians should let Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he declared &quot; Of course I meant the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then to rowing them back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive , and then may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , closely observed the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think it &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ending the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump responded to an even corro@@ sive tone since its re@@ frac@@ tures went further back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to excuse his prov@@ ok@@ ant statements , he acc@@ uses his critics to dis@@ cer@@ ate his testimony or to understand his hum@@ our .
but while he stands in focus of attention over the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ uman Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal companion to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps prominent scientists , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ sli@@ der , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am @-@ Republi@@ cans try to argue that the Government of Obama , in Mrs. Clinton , served as Secretary of State , eliminated ISIS to spread the situation in the N@@ ear East as aggressive .
ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words and to be con@@ du@@ ed against him .
he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked because Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ologi@@ ze for just another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ ot@@ ated café in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years , good coffee was ser@@ rated .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop was pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , decorated in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in cup@@ cakes like cup@@ cakes .
local gener@@ als mour@@ ned as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is change , it &apos;s also new .
a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outside world , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept much more .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lights coming from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches are lined with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ ages like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are nature keys .
the café is not serving beer anymore , but it is fresh juices .
after nine months he said that he noticed a st@@ aff@@ ed electricity to old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by William@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said .
recently on Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way forward .
after closing the ver@@ b , she gave the coffee to a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realised that it was on the coffee and at the culture of the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they drink a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea from that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees of coff@@ ees .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long and loyal customer since the start of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there in front of the work and ordered in@@ sof@@ ter always .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything gel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with butter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal gets its usual order today , but sometimes he changes his season with bacon , eggs and cheese .
Rodriguez said that he did not know a p@@ enny , that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodriguez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabit@@ ant Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish , and Rodriguez said that he pre@@ fers to exp@@ ose it soon , so that his new neighbours will welcome you .
the location also has other lifts .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ dried coffee in the bottles .
there is a chance to expand the café on a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt told that the staff of Lok@@ als and the Order felt a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a f@@ oo@@ dies , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy at Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tor@@ to@@ ise soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bricks in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house near the Lower East Side has been told . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cover with olive oil while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetables .
as the reporter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this pair found the pair for a discussion on food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was pean@@ ut bread , meat lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the years before Great Depression , the table was in a American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male fel@@ ine workers and it was freshly baked and served at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were the Americans sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands the path with which the country went around , not to be the ar@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in the food for the Americans was a central , split topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget of bud@@ get@@ ing was : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and k@@ asser@@ tion were used to stap@@ le food , the casserole dish as &quot; wonderful species , food remains re@@ peti@@ tive , &quot; I noticed Zi@@ egel@@ one , as ch@@ efs able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients among a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by Che@@ ap dried fruit .
meat that has been the heart of the American kitchen for many years , has become a rare luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures were tested , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction priority prior to taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no more popular supplement at lunch@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onion do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ dies of household goods - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country .
by presenting recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become just &quot; budget @-@ makers &quot; and the challenge to transform the pamp@@ er such as cre@@ mic Sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic treat .
in particular , the reports about the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ cake @-@ Food @-@ E@@ ver .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ th heavy man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental food like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a nearly g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and wore a tu@@ x .
he was glorious real@@ ation .
President Roosevelt had perhaps committed the same bug , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to out@@ fit him with his stomach an ex post@@ mark .
as described in the book , the hired servants of the house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors of Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the boring food in Washington , but also one of the best prepared food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food was rejected , once the country came back on her legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science has been applied to food@@ stuffs .
in writing to the book , the couple gave better understand the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans school@@ ing in better - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
brick remin@@ ded himself : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the sw@@ ath .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled down and co@@ e a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roosevelt &apos;s lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick , humble recep@@ tion@@ aries had a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped a spoon into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E repeated three times a sur@@ ge .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ dy he spoke to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he made his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even at a Fass@@ bom@@ ben attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Omar was a member of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a civil group of civilians , which according to the newspaper newspaper , nearly 60,000 people had saved the lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers have their own life on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the vision of the group : a video of the civil actor , which shows him from the ruins of a house with 11 hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians in bright symbols in the horror of war .
as a hero , however , he never seen himself saying : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die trying to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
shortly before Omar had fallen victim to an attack , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have four faç@@ ade bombs at the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ o@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous re@@ mn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rates is nearly 400 years old
more rarely sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually come on the surface only in winter .
this ha@@ zi was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on the ship Shi@@ ff S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only got with 150 years of young offspring .
leis@@ ure@@ ly , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k is swi@@ ft along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this sil@@ ly @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a bul@@ let for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen wrote by the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander S@@ inners from the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this li@@ fes@@ pan , which means verteb@@ rates a world record .
indeed , the evolution@@ ary biolog@@ ist suspected that Greenland will become rock .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland is hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coastal regions of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter .
researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie .
their time @-@ pent@@ ul@@ o measures her , when they spread six animals with a transmitter .
however , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks too : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swallowed up the ja@@ w no@@ ose of a young cone .
possibly , they hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ roll@@ ers at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and search car@@ c@@ asses , that sw@@ ings from higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch of the North Atlantic ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens core with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the shar@@ ks that are contained in the proteins later no longer .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high Carbon @-@ 14 in line core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as atomic tests try larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters , the lenti@@ l core contained a low excess of Carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear forces , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens core that is created by cosmic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 watch showed a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timet@@ res long Green@@ land@@ hai an old of 335 years , while the record @-@ Ha@@ i is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the Green@@ land@@ hai @-@ females then get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters will probably be determined on the threshold of sexual mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ hair is obviously at least one and a half centuries .
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ves are mostly living in icy waters , is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland , in whose neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to low temperatures often the organism from there are living animals on spar@@ ks .
it also mature later - and al@@ ers slow down .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal covers heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on how many generations have as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , however , should rather invest in a long life .
building plot in double pack
with topics around B@@ auen , the common@@ place has focused on the most recent session in the most recent session .
with relief , the Committee adopted the mayor of Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently re@@ inst@@ ated housing can begin . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ zel@@ i@@ des and closure requests were resolved and the applications for measurement were made , the sale of plots in the residential area &quot; road route &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( range of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Termin@@ ator section 1 ) has nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or is convinced that the b@@ lower in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au spoke young families and gl@@ amor@@ ous elderly people alike .
however , as it was called , you can immediately report to the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els , the joint venture is expected to advise in its September meeting .
in order to include further inquiries about res@@ ett@@ lement , further commercial establishments , linked to the creation of jobs , decided the council that only decided in the spring of this year to be re@@ done in sub @-@ areas of this year .
thus in the sub @-@ term , the industrial area has already expanded its two plots heading towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
accordingly , the city has the best chance to attract jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ oli , head of the Comp@@ et@@ ence of Excellence in Financial Markets and Real Estate of the I@@ W .
after a Bre@@ xit , it is uncertain whether bank houses can continue to operate on London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU .
so far the approval in the UK is enough for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass .
they just take advantage of big US banks .
several banks have already announced , to shift jobs .
the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects a 10000 new job work@@ places within five years .
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance cover E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , although it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg , a great fund business , which seems worse , is bad in the infrastructure as well .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt am notice@@ ably easier to reach .
further points the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ oli .
thanks to the Seine , the funds for top @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the corporate consulting Mer@@ cer , the city rose at No. 7 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could move further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite a Bre@@ xit .
there are also the power relations : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US official judge decided that Gilead &apos;s Sciences Inc . , based on the re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the legal costs you have evolved from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge issued a pattern of mis@@ conduct on mer@@ cks including Mein@@ l and other inhumane acts .
in a survey of the complaint on Thursday , US president , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the costs incur@@ red during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ alise the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took over each other @-@ def@@ endants and property on laboratory activities in which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r submitted an active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
from the USA , troops say that they returned complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .

Clinton Ear@@ nings 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released their tax statement for 2015 , revealed that it yiel@@ ded an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million for the presidential candidate and her husband , an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the US donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton had almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; former Secretary of Foreign Affairs received USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their books in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife , Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax returns of the past ten years .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i gave in an opinion .
in a sharp contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false statements and tra@@ vers@@ ations in relation to its previous promises to publish its tax returns .
it is custom@@ ary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged by law because of the law .
tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man and his lawyers have indicated a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for its ref@@ using .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s wrote on Twitter , regarding the release of the presidential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Advisor to CNN that he did not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax tests are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critic , amongst others also the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already agreed that his ref@@ usal to acc@@ use questions regarding assets , his funds for char@@ itable organisations , its operations and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown a video on the Internet and released a video on Friday in the high @-@ ran@@ gling Republi@@ cans of tr@@ ump cap@@ turing his tax returns .
on Thursday , she talked about the subject during a speech about the Michigan economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and release its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump had paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax bill and tax advis@@ ers that still could be the case .
Federal taxes have become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a rule which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election event for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate here his seat , Tr@@ ump on to exchange their tax returns .
buff@@ ett said that he was subjected to a tax examination of the IRS , and the dump is &quot; afraid &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has decl@@ ining tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clinton who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , were paying an effective Federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax statement by the 2015 Clin@@ t showed that these only USD 100 of their income was to be counted as a wage , unlike most of the Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ t divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9,000 .

Jewish director defe@@ ats Berlin Hotel because the Israeli pre@@ fix after &quot; Arab &quot; was removed - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli choice in Berlin since it had an estimated number of people according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Shoah , &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an option to choose Israel via an own call center .
after an explanation , the director looked at the reception .
the answer he got there , &quot; picked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel appointed that the measure has a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was standing , the director stopped anger even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre@@ fix is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the staff of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has worn itself in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large reson@@ ance on the Internet in which people called it a scandal .
some subjected to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged con@@ sent@@ ees of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed to you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was written in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble cour@@ ge of Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly proved all the accus@@ ations from and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not record in the quick list of Israel , quoted a representative of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police use Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke for prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students were putting together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered themselves together to protest against the reforms of the government for public education system .
the police put j@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber floor against prot@@ esters .
the difficulties began when police officers attempted to distinguish the students , which led to the police g@@ ums and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their con@@ ster@@ nation over the plans .
according to the proposals for the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , somewhat less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the participants were looking to see Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ tits against the preliminary President Michel T@@ emer on walls .
the most recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ det president Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff who had been enth@@ r@@ alled by a Senate vote in the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran at the same time was 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interests of Russian companies in the country grew strong , distributed by the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , another trade extension is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran fell by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 to increase to $ 8@@ 56 million compared to the same period in 2015 .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade recovery was reached by deliveries of machines , land @-@ vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes back to this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russian foreign affairs stood around 35,000 Vis@@ as , mainly travel to travel agents , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as regards the tourist number in Russia .
it could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador is hoping that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the ancient per@@ si@@ can civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were handled .
in order to over@@ take the time to the next nov@@ ice drive of all the immigrants , two years later , the Minister of Dep@@ art of St. Anna has decided to prepare for the preparation and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .

S@@ cot Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms at home , gained as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Män@@ ner@@ team spr@@ int in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a role , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y who had made his fellow country@@ man of Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who went home to his home to hit a victory away from New Zealand &apos;s favour@@ ites .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they re@@ peti@@ tive the trick , after having won only a modest sixth place in London in March , despite the return of Ho@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when Hin@@ des appeared .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the gravel , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner pursued an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round the New Ze@@ al@@ ander won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was back on lap after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy of strategy made a large part of transformation from the execution in a higher gear to slow him down and it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defe@@ ating the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win .
after the triumph of 2012 on the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there were Hin@@ des that he looked after a weak start to the track .
he drew this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we came so badly up with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months is that we are expecting successful five days in vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for the British sport ; Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster , were born on 23 March ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels really lon@@ ely , to win alone .
Hin@@ der said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , it should be beaten to a k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ on of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometres race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , who won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins meeting safety in focus .
he was cont@@ ested yesterday with supp@@ ression of the qualification , when officials call him to measure his body size .
the female competition that will continue tomorrow and finished , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB Team is on his strong platform to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a stake to medals .
after a truly extraordinary view of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations were driven down for Rio .
it played drama in the background , so the resignation of the technical head Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the heart of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ les , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees itself the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks very afterwards , then the legendary reputation GB@@ S , which has reached a perfect moment , has to be repeated again .
future of the melting of Portland due to increased energy consumption .
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are on the game , as the plant operator contrac@@ ted the energy supply agreement and will thus raise all delivery contracts , such as the supplied energy company ha@@ sten@@ ed .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout lasts for 20 years .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Portland are located on the game .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk at a closure .
in addition , domin@@ ates could come to domin@@ ate , as the melting point consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melting , which resulted in a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which exposed the large aluminium scra@@ m@@ ist with his Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ex Valley , divided that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the system is operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continues to argue that the treaties so @-@ called &quot; securing transactions &quot; should be present in force from November 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treaties have a 12 months notice of notice that they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the business year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong schedule markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L divided that it had already written the value of the contracts in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of an termination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to book the contracts called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Arti@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; melt the melting or the power supply to ensure the melting point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that it has completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still an explanation , why it is ref@@ unded by the contract .
analysts are warning to the poor economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closing of Portland @-@ melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland brought about 900 meg@@ awatts of electricity every year around 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ an reality TV @-@ star , that is available on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue
San Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as she finished the cover of their sister and finished with a classical twist : you have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the kl@@ ish@@ oo@@ ed action almost every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ rest assured the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , but Kris had to leave her other girl somehow involved in this publi@@ city .
with regard to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , the Vo@@ gue started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ alls great Sister Kim is concerned about what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ edition is the most common issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a range that resem@@ bles more than a fashion magazine , the output represents a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accord@@ ing Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a ) by the 8@@ 32 pages of the bearing ( 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the revel@@ ations of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years images of the magazine was still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover are Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Moss .
in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; as &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
in 2013 , Oscar winner &apos;s winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had honor .
but even at the low probability that Mrs Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; Break@@ through model &quot; of their generation , is under the former category , it is in a good company .
those celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people , or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turning a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are engaged in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ant &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ant appeared constantly in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues critic@@ ised her colleagues &apos; the Mi@@ st@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ined back up when the message comes out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ant on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but ride on the mixed lot seems to pass by the point .
Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your prim@@ ers by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in her free time she is watching TV . presumably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres show 16@@ 0,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid con@@ fig@@ ure@@ head are rejected by the community centers in the year , while the industry had already made the impact of further medium @-@ cuts in already loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ og@@ ations and the same have been rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services in the community , which are already over@@ ly fast@@ ed , make themselves ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , this legal centres will continue to lose up further 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Municipal Park was revealed that thousands of people already had been rejected by people each year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse by the federal government &apos;s resolutions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ land Municip@@ alities are chronic under@@ funded , meaning thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ able and pressing debt , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ fortun@@ ate - all these people have problems of legal way and this survey shows that they do not need the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will cut the resources by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning thousands of people from Queensland to be forced out of Queensland with their legal issues without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand the Federal Prosecutor and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ ers and the Federal Minister of Queensland , George Bran@@ dis , to reverse these medium @-@ cuts promp@@ tly , giving people the help they need to obtain legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to national average .
it is now at the time to see the needs of the community centers and their client communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey in front of countries elections : SPD and CDU lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) have significant losses on the gover@@ ning parties of the SPD and the CDU .
this revealed the representative surveys of the opinion research Institute for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could move closer to the North , this is not possible after the re@@ frac@@ tional values in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and would have good chances to continue their head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party thus b@@ lows down the CDU only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
the left hand would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the national parliament .
in spite of the slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens entered the Gre@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the national parliament each with 3 percent .
according to the Berlin House of Represent@@ atives , the SPD &apos;s SPD is estimated to say only 23 percent ( choice 2011 : 2@@ 8.3 percent ) .
the CDU only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
they still have to say behind the Green Party with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left , with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope to return the pirates to miss the pirates .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ assy .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ abytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers the devices can still buy in the Internet , but they come from the st@@ on@@ age of the internet era .
20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product to be announced for a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access@@ ing web pages was possible by HTML @-@ Browser , if also tor@@ ment@@ ing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be stopped as a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen found themselves .
very proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could know in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone card of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates providers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online anywhere and anywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices were sold , in Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the global sales of the equipment is around € 400 billion .
these are the well @-@ going shops of the countless app providers and t@@ elec@@ oms corporations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the smartphone , in the meantime , a whole industry has developed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive breakthrough to mass market occurred at the beginning of 2007 . at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he also promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and a internet communications , easy to use via touch screen .
Apple has started the winner of Apple , the iPhone is the most important product of the corporation .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had seen the night .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
now the days have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smartphone is 20 years after his invention , an understand@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , every German has seen 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get out the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessings .
England must expand the Olympic spirit and expand in Heathrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heathrow will not only be in our local community and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ en , the same as in 2012 , when we were operated on a big effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be back , as we create new opportunities for local and firms in the vicinity of Heathrow .
for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and will cause youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were in London 2012 , there will be such people going to think that the challenge of the enlargement heathen is too large .
I told me that England never gets ready for the games and that we will blow on the world stage .
they had been wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heathrow .
there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heathrow touched every question .
like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is one for many and not for individual infrastructure project .
enlargement is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion at wid@@ est growth and left a legacy of skills and employment at both the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in Heathrow that has been implemented a £ 11 billion imp@@ ose infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T5 - which was elected five years in a row at the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two @-@ frequency cat@@ walk of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third running cat@@ walk , supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one of them .
it is time to expand this Olympic spirit and Heathrow and create our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment , to be proud of England .

&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ oleum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad locking systems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with On@@ line@@ wer@@ der , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid display block@@ ers , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and mouse &quot; play . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad loos@@ ening on his desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to block up again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding on its advertising display , to display it displays the detection of it , which is part of the page advertisement , to be more difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block told that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blo@@ gger wrote the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ Stru@@ ggle is underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left for social media in the struggle , is a strong indication of how to obtain wor@@ r@@ ying points for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ge@@ air , Adobe has some 200 million people display of advertising ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion per day active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices makes hand @-@ advertising 84 percent of the advertising revenues .
in addition , the company has no effect on display systems on desktop PCs , because mobile network block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker divided .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenues , such as Facebook receives the investment of such a pac@@ emaker as worthwhile .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that the number of blocks would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters , because they could also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; for the user this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; a spokes@@ man shared by Facebook in an email message .
ad block@@ ers are a silent tool , which is why we have concentrated on Develop@@ ers tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people instead .
woman susp@@ ects suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses , after a woman in the early morning hours of Thursday was suspected of having taken suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman found herself in Dun@@ kl@@ en in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said .
it is obvious that a Swiss population at the age of 49 , which was passed by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , these as well as each voucher of the incident .
it was opening up investig@@ ative proceedings , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , the Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait , if one of the driver will be displayed .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver won &apos;t be pulled to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran on the motorway - was decided that the drivers do not assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night runs on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent hom@@ icide was acquitted when they had killed a man and killed one night on the top of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was un@@ conscious of the street .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman - who had responded to a justified way -- justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judges .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should noti@@ fied at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate models : Venus was once hab@@ itable
Venus was , according to projections of a new NASA climate model , probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on using tools and algorith@@ ms to res@@ emble climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus can be identified with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once exhausted .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have a thin , er@@ d@@ dy atmosphere , and nonetheless slowly turned around .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved to be more dry conditions than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accom@@ o@@ date life and shake fast ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus had also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS range simulation , the slow circum@@ stance of Venus its daily page of Venus had almost two months , &quot; explained by G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io to a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella due to the surface of a bulk of the sun@@ ba@@ the paras@@ ols .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles Evolution , which was prec@@ eded by Planet@@ arium researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billion years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro @-@ departed , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly green effect -- Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che in Thursday and led to a small participation in decision @-@ making of the team .
an alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer .
&quot; in the past three years , I have met my obligations as chief coach and vice President of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy met in a statement .
during the summer long and much more thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to give it a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of train@@ ers and vice president of Hockey operations need to be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a joint right of decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has won the winning season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer in the League .
he led the club on 112 points and in first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the two last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches represented a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the wild for a second game spot spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal newsletter and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ p workers take up talks again , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be suspended on the re@@ mun@@ eration for the North Sea workers , while all the parties voted for a new talk round at the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the un@@ ites and r@@ ust trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the crash process of the current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some all @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting the beginning of next year to re @-@ start problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , has been a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
Wood Group has cut the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the companies needed the needed room to come through the market recovery .
Shell has released for his part of thousands of people and plans to give up his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a consequence of its mega @-@ breaking relations with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are under pressure , due to lower raw oil prices , a economic situation that would rely on the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliamentary committee , Dave Anderson , met up with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the greatest jobs in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion worth spending for new projects in the North Sea expected to aver@@ aged around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the shooting of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Wel@@ cope teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers in order to collect the most complete catalogue on rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the stars .
the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star@@ loops are rotating at different rates as well as in the context of the emergence process with the planet Earth .
we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Inf@@ ra Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from Earth .
many stars in this constellation , originating from approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they turn right now on the fastest .
at top rates , these mature stars encounter large quantities of star fa@@ des .
because these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a slow effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ erts , his rotation rate starts to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of every star , putting the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like s@@ ungl@@ asses -- .
the newest catalog of Rot@@ ation rates indicates that the more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while larger stars slower than smaller pi@@ rou@@ ettes .
&quot; in the Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , clear , whereas faster Rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mic laboratory to compare performance qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it &apos;s still much ahead of us what we like to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow down their rotation rates and to speak to their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star step@@ pe off
tears slept at Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball star in best days of base .
after his emotional recovery announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will carry the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &apos; to assist the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Particip@@ ants of the Major League bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodriguez became the most valuable player of the League , he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature is under a ten @-@ year contract , 27 million US dollars annually .
by the end of the contra@@ ction on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - at full salary .
as a player , Rodriguez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) and gained the Yan@@ ke@@ es since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show another two bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should nevertheless not be recorded in the resting @-@ hall of the bas@@ eball .
because that &apos;s so successful Rodriguez - the nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field , so the occurr@@ ence outside of the place is cont@@ ested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was employed between 2001 and 2003 , which banned the ster@@ oids of ster@@ oids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed down due to a change in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal to 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodriguez is considered to be the major suspect for years to have received funding over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodriguez then said to me .
even his farewell @-@ days do not fail to be silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends still get the big stage again , Rodriguez had often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves attempting to win any game , &quot; Show Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married to the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the interview with Pop@@ star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson mentioned , sympathy and fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee Arch@@ du@@ val Boston Red SO@@ X .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping properties
wi@@ ped : because of a positive d@@ oping sample the ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland won &apos;t start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overs@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping waste .
an caught athl@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ oping cases have become known as the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metres steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded from the beginning of the world @-@ critical athle@@ tics competitions this news into the accident .
last Sunday , Ch@@ en has been documented the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de on Sunday which is used as a m@@ asked resource for d@@ oping sub@@ stances .
the International sports court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon in their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en had to take part in the stock exchange of over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has applied the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IOC , but CA@@ S is responsible for the sport@@ ation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive test with Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athl@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act with the banned substance to act the d@@ op@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended on the preliminary basis , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ trial should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ ted him to answer him immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athl@@ ete do not drag the right shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are Bulgarian under observation , so many are already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , approximately every weight lifting from the nation can not participate in the chronic d@@ op@@ ing@@ polluted nation .
on Friday , the fall of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ olic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both will deny the taking , however both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world @-@ federation had set up the complete Russian team up to an exception due to systematic Dop@@ pler , while the L@@ äu@@ nation Kenya also produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the life of swimming , earlier verses have also been carried out in China for severe disp@@ utes between athletes .
thus the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang E@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle , I will hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio .
sun also stood at the centre of a confron@@ tation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ orton H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping frau@@ d@@ gers , &quot; said this .
sun was positive in 2014 during the Chinese championships , but had to be tested a three @-@ month lock .
dat@@ ashe@@ et : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pressen h@@ ack@@ ers her rans@@ om
programm@@ ers of ex@@ tor@@ tion mal@@ nutrition are currently targeted company - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the mal@@ war@@ ding specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of surveyed companies were at least once , some of several victims of an attack with black@@ print software .
in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies have already been target of a ran@@ som@@ ce ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims were willing to resolve the charges required by the T@@ ables to be able to utili@@ ze the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alise their ex@@ tor@@ tion software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes and attacks on attacks in corporate networks .
if they succeed there , the potential loos@@ ening money will be considerably higher than in private use .
&quot; we are currently watching a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ dives have been designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the express software for themselves .
only private users were the goal , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly during the past few months .
ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it looks specifically for un@@ long @-@ changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ s and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the final turn@@ key code , the victim will need money - usually in form of value added Bit@@ coin .
but where in private use the personal photo database is on the game , it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage will fall when a ran@@ som@@ ing strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to under@@ mine business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients could be threatened through the loss of sick .
&quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
yet , 80 to 90 per cent of the companies paying , their data get back .
for managers , it is difficult , in view of stagn@@ ation in operation the demands of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , security researchers from F @-@ Secure have studied user interfaces and contact with the agents and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to make more money .
they explain their sacrifices by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , set free in@@ accessible support websites or de@@ code for free example files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed to be paid out of a few hundred euros , companies have to deal with hard @-@ negoti@@ ation and five @-@ digit sum@@ s to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ce Er@@ express , the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the job , explain security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ce about within a week . &quot;
it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their failure software in the form of a software structure to the actual ex@@ tor@@ tion .
the previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; the scope of delivery is a adap@@ tive tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the Bu@@ press@@ ors are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so , in one of the forums on the underground , the set is buying from a crimin@@ als and sends another software to install the software to many PCs as possible .
payment is made per employee calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als carry Sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known in many companies that make their data better .
over 50 percent of companies &apos;s IT developers responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust Ran@@ som@@ ce can be able to rep@@ el the back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; when the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful replacement , the perpet@@ rators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this makes the s@@ lugg@@ ish potential depending on the type of data a multiple times higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also take up entirely new goals on the Internet of Things .
on the h@@ acker conference , Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers as they could have been using the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the c@@ lich@@ ary of a so blocked heating so many victims could definitely be a rans@@ om .
if the perpet@@ rators are then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ day @-@ fit
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to wrap everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life .
although only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have lots of space in the first row and in the rear , it seems to be close to any location .
the materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls down there .
versatile as comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is the storage room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l , with high @-@ quality and 10@@ 26 l made of folding down rests , but there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical , than it sounds : seating area of the return bench can be folded like cinema bo@@ ilers and offer a storage room which is high from the floor up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk is well loaded , however , the load level with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008 .

air@@ line doesn &apos;t carry : down@@ fall to passenger bridge
&quot; &quot; &quot; an airline is not responsible for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers which are typical of air traffic , argued the Upper District Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a kne@@ e at the fall .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
sickness : when paid for the event
after their journey , only money will get back when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate free to find out in the hotel .
but this is only the case , if more than 10 per cent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the trial , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rhoea in the second day of their Turkish offensive .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective f@@ rank , which supposedly poll@@ utes the sea water .
the family was the view that the journey was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success before the court .
indeed , the cl@@ utter situation was defective .
but the organizer did not know shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to go out that the sea water was fine .
so he did not hurt his information , so the verdict .
especially in the samples of the water there were no imp@@ urities found .
the condition of several hotel guests - perhaps by plug@@ ging each other - belonged to the common life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 people .

this triumph will not allow the terrorists .
if off@@ ender had to leave the country faster , this will increase the safety and strength of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to reach an implementation of the proposals until the end of the Bundestag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ ell rein@@ forcement of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ digit order form over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ri@@ cher for the char@@ cu@@ ti@@ ers in the CDU / CS@@ U &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Gabriel said the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fun@@ ke Media Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the motorway bre@@ eder
it is st@@ out regularly on the stra@@ pping road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal system should pro@@ long .
this is good news for all the car drivers who go to the occupation street every night in the city centre , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
the road construction continues to extend road construction on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Street , the right track which is 700 metres away .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road right .
the major advantage : traffic is early based on how the total completed section of the Federal highway 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Repres@@ entation Münster @-@ West .
driving direction on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerv@@ t is the driver &apos;s driver especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; week@@ day extends back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping route and sometimes beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the con@@ i@@ fer on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic will only be tra@@ cked on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be restored to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge has no longer necessary load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the daily cancellation of the daily St@@ au shall not say , then the competent country can &apos;t say .
however , for years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official run time up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal system , the con@@ stric@@ ter period deliberately sought the traffic crash@@ es during school holidays , because it is charged with disabilities .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday , on Wednesday .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has attended a presentation of the award winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the club , which has set itself the cultural integration of adolescents with a migration and refugee community , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most students of the class come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the course , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .

rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvements
the weather was made in the southwest of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a d@@ ash through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night would have been badly suitable for clouds and rain to observe the Himm@@ els@@ spectacle , said the Chairman of the Z@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday mor@@ nings .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
when shooting stars , Per@@ sei@@ den , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they apparently come from the Per@@ seus constellation , which is in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening it gets caught forever , at night you wake up awake , in the morning it &apos;s already far from the wake @-@ up cl@@ ing@@ les to think of sleep anymore .
that &apos;s all other than relaxing .
after all , it is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent emp@@ ow@@ es their sleep frequently or rather relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and it can cause them varied causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eg , member of the German Society for Lo@@ com@@ ers and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is an entry and sleep problem .
especially that can sleep through many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ sufficient , Jens Wag@@ ne@@ cht says the board member of the German home medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind Sle@@ ep Dis@@ orders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological , or behavi@@ oral factors , however , can also be used medications .
not rarely is the sleep problem expressions of any other condition .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is often common in depression , &quot; says We@@ ep .
and it can be that different factors op@@ presses each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lay bad , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and starts to sal@@ v@@ ingly , about everyday problems and care to sal@@ v@@ els , give wisdom an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I sleep with sleep disorders ?
whoever doesn &apos;t sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week , and is com@@ promised on the day , should go to the doctor , does We@@ ep advis@@ es .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look quite different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ marked , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep problem , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and for a maximum of two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
located in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University of Berlin , is hardly empha@@ sized .
therefore , at first one should turn problems with sleep problems at first , does We@@ ep advis@@ es .
you can clari@@ fy your studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should be in sleep laboratory , and what happened ?
for checking in a sleep @-@ laboratory medical profession , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing , in case of illness fatigue , at bed@@ time or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleep problem , explains Fi@@ xing .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not have a mid@@ day hi@@ ber@@ nation , &quot; says Fi@@ xed .
after reduced , one walks into the bed at its normal time .
beside the electro@@ des in the body one is wearing s@@ ungl@@ asses , a chest strap and a fountain on his finger .
she also paints a camera on the ceiling of sleeping .
how can suffer@@ ers get rid of the problems in the handle ?
there are pretty many screw@@ driving up where you can attach for a better sleep .
neither counts on : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch television for sleeping , alcohol to avoid drinking alcohol at the clock - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s all at all .
what the jungle camp with lack medals in swimming
former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook as a dis@@ appointing turn of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he was first brought gold at the Doha @-@ World Championships in Doha and exhibited its first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has put into account his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle heads of 150.000 € could not be surprised by no lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night on Friday at his Facebook page .
the transport system in sports is bad , d@@ oping controls are very good .
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote very much , and can &apos;t really watch the d@@ oping theme or even run it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that these checks are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first start to the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly the same way with countries .

airport : bonds of luggage
professional thi@@ eves at the Airport Düsseldorf
civilian b@@ ahn@@ ders of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer Police escaped the capture of two women and two men in the age of 50 @-@ 61 years .
the susp@@ ects have committed several hand@@ ker@@ chi@@ efs and pil@@ es of pan@@ ties .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civil servants recognized in the area of Düsseldorf &apos;s airport a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ ties since mid @-@ July and were collabor@@ ative , working in and particularly profession@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the crime of criminal off@@ ences , 34 can demonstrate their actions for off@@ ences from off@@ ences to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros .
Alt@@ built , a few lime trees , in between yet another head@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the town .
when you walk along the east along the east , one comes along playing fields , a fresh@@ en kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house somebody has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot;
opposite the Li@@ dl , which is to be disman@@ tled , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ements will be created here .
article about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible for the company Friedrichsha@@ in , will be pre@@ fers with burning cars in the last weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor are premises guarded and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , at the beginning of the year , the Berlin City Centre has repeatedly been responsible for a tough approach to the police , which was called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ets , cleared with 300 police officers , had been pat@@ ched by police officers and three weeks of official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three cre@@ w@@ men on site , closed parts of the road , and stopped to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative District Court decided that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and hab@@ itations .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents go with children walking , people sitting on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others convers@@ ing in the late street .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the principal concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are three children , are gener@@ ously generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the hood , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a &quot; Kie@@ z , who wanted to offer a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin City Council and the police officers , make up their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour @-@ quarter , which is today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
also houses and native projects belong to the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 many homes were occupied in the former East , including almost all the Main Street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the main@@ frame was cleared under large police force in a real road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who were occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the district in recent years has become increasingly become a mag@@ nets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : now they share their residents from East @-@ times and former home @-@ etz@@ er their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable even when renting cars , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to colours .
no other street has been mentioned this year so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason for that not all neighbours may have this as a problem , it could not necessarily be affected by crime : crimes such as body violation , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make non @-@ damage , which tend to meet newly built and newly renovated houses .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 years , cannot be heard of uncertainty .
as for violent actions , it is crucial : people in the 94 are their neighbours , who have not been determined .
also the famous burning cars admit it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er already longer .
for the German architect , their street is not a criminal inc@@ entive , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is conscious of the thorou@@ gh@@ bred road - and remained .
that &apos;s why it was so important that local residents returned to their streets : from the police , the politics and the media , which claimed the interpretation of the city in July all round .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will still be taken away : through un@@ com@@ promising new@@ buildings in former construction g@@ aps that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well booked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not gu@@ ise . &quot;
but what should you do when somebody hears anybody ?
there places fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer possesses little understanding for Zu@@ bay@@ ern , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the Hau@@ tes and the Left Sc@@ ene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from , should be aware of - just like someone who is moving into a pub area to compl@@ ain there badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names were asked to be called to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee contrac@@ tor
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partner for integration and organizer .
in addition , she is a social worker .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee contrac@@ tor for Ur@@ bach since July .
social ped@@ agog@@ ics supports the management of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as the contact partner for all actors : refugees , workers refugee aid , administration , authorities , and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the Working Group indicates that the volunteer is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the gre@@ ed wo@@ ol@@ d@@ au that has a problem above all .
so some - less mo@@ cked than the multitude of relevant assign@@ ments - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , an ei@@ ving wool mil@@ der .
however , administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is necessary to organisation , work with people on site , and behind the scenes , as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place to be limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ lich and full official actors support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
coming soon , new containers are located in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been found since a period of time to find flats for the connection people that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection assembly .
they must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes .
the costs for building , rent or renovation of these accommodation must wear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ sell@@ or to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not everyone land@@ lord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been made very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private homes .
it doesn &apos;t work until now , so you need to rely on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , Community dwell@@ ings need to be respected as it is so beautiful .
so new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and subsidies for refugees and migrants who have to be ti@@ led or established .
&quot; more places were good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ star , perform char@@ itable work - and that motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that work for the community is leading to a positive aspect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but that &apos;s not just work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
humans would have to develop a conc@@ ession .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here management and honorary posts .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you have to explain the refugees that it will take time to over@@ take time , for example , with language courses .
whoever makes the feeling of evolution , he could not help in Ur@@ bach , I should not work and be un@@ profitable , I will never be in@@ corporate .
the clear majority is motivated .
problem cases , however , does the customer be honest , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer may always be motiv@@ ating others .
everything was already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do they have fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine tells quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher can call nai@@ ve . &quot; a rest of the risk and would not exclu@@ de them .
sensi@@ tively to be sensi@@ tively aware of the hel@@ pers .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the assass@@ in bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would happ@@ ily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary site must look for activities and in the region according to activities .
they always have in the background that a new shot could be coming to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clear , the politics are afraid .
actually , it is unfair to place them on @-@ site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher even utilized to integrate the existing people in sensible .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they have to help them , both of them are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers .
