<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the Sportpyramide</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are horrible.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a variety of colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses had reminded of their holiday evening, they pursued the quick gallop to the house.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometre at this speed, I'm afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the horsemen ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He left with his family on the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he won't go to photography.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen, so it was the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala with Golden Sportramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">And does not lack the sympathetic sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Reserve, silver bay leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen left him already.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid of trees.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">This award means a lot, "says Langer," because she is not only awarded for sportive successes, but also for social commitment. "</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer promotes young talent.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money from 25.000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 more outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US masterclass winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sports."</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the flags of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Given, the Freal Cornelia Hanan, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the pioneer Alwin Shockemöhle and posthumum of the Palballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sporting activities came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the lively company moved into the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza price ran.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, unjust the two US presidential values are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The one, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against such as the State of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to steer the economy to death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, however, would be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will go massively, and makes it strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">For this reason, taxes would be increased to the rich, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">The latter has to be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost worsening.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical tea party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on trump, there could be partnly internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearer are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and drive the coal extraction in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in the protected areas so that he plans to cancel the Parisian climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment programme and requires: "a country will create the superpower of the clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not just in infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the self-fish trade agreement, they both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both of them want to isolate the U.S. from international trade but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, calls to Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a starring.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it up to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in that question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to discharge the economy and citizens to spur growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him ahead, that the budget deficit would only be bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who want to ask at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen, four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each baby has a baby, which is only a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">She placed her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stacks on the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice it is being monitored.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene is normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is the division's director of Condrobs, a carrier for social packages in Bavaria, and it deals with the subject of women on the escape.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-conditioned women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs merged the furnishings with pro family and the Munich women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no - not as visitors alike.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an waist before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it's not exaggerated: every woman who comes here has lived on her escape experience with sexual violence," "" "Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are torturing" "" "torture or death" "" "because they send them to Europe as a" "" "hope to look for Europe" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Among women, other reasons for the escape: "many are stealing away secretly because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, compulsive, honesty, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">And that drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the tug for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a rarity," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who, as soon as they should come to Germany, believe that the end is about danger.</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to some 90 percent of women living in the Munich North, traumatized and underestimated.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so familiar to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to speak openly about the awakening, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't get to help, there are more accommodations for them, demands Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question whether they have been using a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabia alone, women should not be accommodated separately, Karl-Heinz Meyer says, press preteners of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In some community shelters, underground and middle franken are available in some dormitories or private homes for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="44">In a study published in the committee it says: "it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately."</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "lack of privacy or men and women are accommodated, it can lead to - ongoing" "" "violence against women" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">The shower room should be easily accessible and accessible to women easily, stands in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel the need of this need, you can't read it, which there will be at the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "since it has been around, we have a long queue," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outer lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is in receiving his Turkish counter-player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot defend me that Ankara wants the reconciliation of the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the gale, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin worked very narrow and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "in contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report about five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper, that Erdogan would have behaved so much worse than would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's shining, sustainable feelings showed that Russian leader of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the crisis of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his execution: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The abandon was even greater, as it was committed by a shared friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Vetroen is being rebuilding up again, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media led a strong, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed like the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Serious accusations from senior officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse when Putin wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a truce are clearly on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is first all of his friends who he can get after spending the last month during a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terrorist attacks on Turkey were also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of batants that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agency and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal tower of the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the Bavarian television set forecast fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish farm imports will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it looked at its response to the attempted putty of power than weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To achieve this, the persistent Groll of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike of it is to take advantage of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d "état for the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a self-understandable for Moscow, that even has to change a deeply sitting fear of the regime.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace located in the sea, it enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst at once, "Alliance of outsides": two countries that have violated the West and are badly treated and allied with.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public propitiation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently announced the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support additional pages.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks on the press conference, both presidents affirmed that they didn't even seize the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey avoided it deliberately to answer a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on what a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect Disaster, when NATO member Turkey lost the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of states talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan divided the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Since then, the Bank has since distanced itself since it had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time brand offensive "RBS" have used to protect other end-consumer brands.</seg>

<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>

<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan has been interviewed during a inspection tour of customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "he shared the BBC Scotland with:" "" "the brand RSB will become our Investors" "" "brand and the brand that our staff will be busy as we are now able to become a bank of brands." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">I say now that we have no global goals, but pursue local goals.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these stamps, in their own municipalities, will stand for something completely different and our staff will work among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already announced that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsorship, and that it will enhance the perceptibility of various brands in its sport sponsoring.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop to the Bank of brands, as we focus on inside (we have asked) to do this to a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been very cynical three years ago, when we had said we had been a great bank for our customers and launched these trademarks.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.</seg>

<seg id="12">Dettori takes the cheers when he takes the victory at Predilection</seg>

<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey on modernity and it's no surprise that he reached this milestone, just a few before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the other in weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, enthusiasm and charisma enthusiastic fans already for this sport for years.</seg>

<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was deputy of Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn, Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Tokyo Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the site of Kremlin, it's (in Russian) that he was later destructed and Vice President of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support its activity as head of state and controls on the implementation of your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked about to leave his position and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Find out the smiling facets?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">SergeIvanov had long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest collaborators as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff has returned to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced, especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that once as a potential president was praised, a man who wants to lead to Russian environmental policy - pushed for a great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks at Putin, which are cited in the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation with me this very complicated item - one could almost say - to have confidence for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin is a former member of the KGB's Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov had become President of Russia's second term. as a third tenure of Putin was forced to violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post has been taken by another, obvious allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin was Prime Minister before he became President of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of total bridge trucks are in their place and the last section of the decks gets a cheque for the deck, which means that the whole Deck will be ready to be lifted to its place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Brown's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens answered: investors should become much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD suggests a "manual concept living" to the next ratchet.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First, it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">One control is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD faction Chair Christoph Fritmann writes:" "" "we agree with the greenery: those who want to build on urban areas must be 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However the affordable housing can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the main point in the town hall was," "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on such areas at least 10 per cent, but 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments build." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new city housing program, which will cost millions, and must be financed, shall provide for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, as Bratman: "there is still no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left will still want to take hardness to investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of, as Bratman, paving a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the manual concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program isn't completely complete: because the approximately 1260 new apartments were to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">How does one compare the loss of further 1300 inexpensive apartments, whose funding is going out in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to get apartments back into the price bond.</seg>
<seg id="25">That is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">On a strike the problem can be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because at the end of the western city, Fristen are running at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 dwellings could be found there in the price for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they don't want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social apartments in the Weststadt is again drastically increased, it is removed from the aim of the so-called mixed mixture.</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak areas in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be a movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's fascinating, how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are not going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time outdoors on screens, has been proclaiming in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, people are about to get people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The screen at the screen was at the beginning on TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and activity do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app which was based on the characters, which were created first for the video games in the 1990s (later, it developed a animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture fell the interest in front of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was moved through the massive demand, which overloaded the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smartphones go out and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once they were once found, "photographed" (about a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps caused by" "" "average" person "" "every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiac, an app for Apple Watch, followed by the 35,000 users, shared the Washington Post recently, the number of people followed every day 30 minutes, who jumped 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it simply looks the rough data to improve performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public clarification campaigns for the health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "threw every day" "" "on deaf ears because many public embassies are boring by people who look at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives regularly, reduces his chances to get cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages which is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing that Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered, exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, there are also oral gamembers that must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new one will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons success, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activity in the real world and to be chasing with many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clomm on Thursday for the combined events and extended the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team cadin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles turnt the pig-balken during the single campaign for women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American player who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth, while they consolidate its reputation, the best of their generation, or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">It succeeds in the same league as Michael Phelps, who brought up their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles dominated their sports art in the last three years, including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals, who have a mixture of ambition and precision, that she said, "The best gymnast is that I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to be a final examination in Brazil, a contest that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a last oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not return with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace her, after winning gold and silver in the single multi campaign for women at the Olympic Summer 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday and won.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles won the first coin on Tuesday while she served as a clamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the team-party coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on the top, never planned the future, that's not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which included their typical Tumbling Pass - is based on Latin American music, which would suit the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boormans mother during a school trip to the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, was put into force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost a multi-campaign competition in the summer of 2013, a victory of victory that will continue as long as it wants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina led by two turns, the picture deceited.</seg>
<seg id="27">Pig balken and buds - in which Biles holds the world title - listen.</seg>
<seg id="28">They went back with 15,433 on the pig's balancing again - and with a 15,933 on the floor still a one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected their Enderial - a pure formality - and tears abored on fine red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in their collecting book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was vengeance for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake in Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team capitulated, called "Oma," a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground, she overthrew the audience of Kusshvolumes, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seems doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As regards Biles, so quickly the 19-year-old tweet has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I introduce myself under the women's olympiship in the gymnastics and that from more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I joined every summer Olympics in 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspirational for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Cathokin is off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidated the black and hispanic female presence at the head of this sport species.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one was one of the female Turnership a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the unbelievable achievement of the triple world champion from Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but masterful Gymtikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see gymnasages throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie put all the same way as Aly and Madison one to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last five" as the next Olympics will have only four turbines in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turns a more expensive sport is and Turner will unite the first line in private gymnastics which are maintained by parents, which are responsible for training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their Turner and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Gyms lie in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, Turner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainee of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both its athletes since it started with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the churches of Aun numerous young girls who inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnasification.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my Turnstiftung of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we offer free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expire to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high-quality gymnastics to get the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determinative for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is so exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holes of Olympic Team golds and thank you that so many young girls motivates her way to start their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="35">"the electoral tribunal found Luton Rahman and his proxy for a lack of corrupt and illegal practices as incomparable," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com might make him safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to get around with armed preaches.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or back, this video will show you how you turn the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you come back from behind, then you should turn up as the first, so that you can see your attackers and enter "yourself from the Fire line," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pull the gun then between your forearm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Knead it with the knee to the body and rotate, while the attacker is soaked in pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into your face and move on backwards, while they do the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching, the technology is similar - move your body from the Line of Fire, seize the weapon and rotate it, so the attacker is not to shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Head out the weight on the gun and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its handle before moving forward and make the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British journey interrupt the immune system and thrombeflex of a serious test - marking some of the humblest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a Euro casein, a railings at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button in Russia as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before removing every object, he used a luminometer, in order to show and let us show on what it is settled.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the dishwaher knob of a tractor toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely disgusting, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen spula.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical experts on promoting intestinal bacteria, as well as on his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left, which he licked, more than a bad breath in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resistance of its intestine by travelling around the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to stations up to dishwasps of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health affects and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and ludge."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely just right.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he dismissed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test line showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminescence number is freshly made hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their Luminescence count increased more than 4000 units, while freshly baked hands have a little less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce Valio produced the travel ilm "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial numbers at different locations such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is the worst thing I've joined in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not mistaken here, because it's inside it inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy produce Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumers really something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating, and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorings which ended with it, that we said, "Let us make ourselves Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have liked my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have directed to it, just like the lavish Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to fetch them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film. "</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent that they have at least occasionally use products containing insufficient lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="28">It was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the church, who have courageous to us and have given us the information provided.</seg>

<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this staging, Bartoli plays an older than Mary.</seg>

<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his glances, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get any of the summer campaign with - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Sunday election will not again take place right at the end of the summer holidays, the Assembly has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">But, as far as far as it does not have: summer holidays, heat and landscaping throes - that is.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced by the electors are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not any natives, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">They come to practical problems: in the vacations are helpers, the posters that hang up, flashes, flyers, and flyers the end of the vote, apply only mühl.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and final day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to wait for a campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot stage, if one can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition that must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">What is exciting, how strong Neuling AfD cuts and what remains in the end of coalient construction.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age, and his head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chat a little with the people, as well as his predecessor to his predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is the blame for Afro-bloom.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, you" "" "We create" "" "have accelerated the rise of the populists, which will now cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right time on the right place of election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel twice chancellor with German Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's federal government is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxda as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity to nobody to listen to other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the northeastern CDU remains largely on the usual election campaign on market places and in front of shopping malls with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This means cocades, plays only a "minor role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union, too, has noted that in the country her base must crumble, that it must be very strict to find a wire back to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there are in the borders of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU electoral coking to its Mitterrors is, however, self-debearing: "you have to go there where human beings are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much in the game stands, Sellering has called his SPD now to an especially committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the polls, S & D Group finally fell by 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD still clearly won 35.6 percent prior to the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, will probably make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue from the holiday-need and make their choice of choice on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign" is known as the President Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green electoral violence on track ensuites according to local stimulus are among the holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gaek, the top candidate, curvy just with a houseboat through the meckline lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was called in enterprise issues.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen sees the possibility that clients come about half a year after conversion with a engine damage to a workshop, and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in Customer Interest, it is important to avoid that any damage caused by any other damage caused by any guarantee of guarantees in terms of guarantee is how it was called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men mean age groups love sheets.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to the comment to overtake him under the pseudonym nonAlleAllemen's aid with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multitudes of records of records are not seen on a boom in millennials, who want to greet the novelty of physical objects, but attributable to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record have been foreseen before the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older flatters retain their emotions rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I keep in the midst of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and wild gesture before I stand still keeping my hands and have a bit of determining as: "so, let's throw a closer look."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's throw a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of SoHos is slowly standing on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent seller were based - are there still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to eliminate the camera for the next part, in which I stand up close to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I asked Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three male middle ages) to Reckless Records (data count: eight men of medium-age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed by him), dressing the walls of his sitting room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income is: it is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy it when she was selling, when he was young and plexed.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are out of the late 60s, early 70's, who appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is true that those who buy records, rather introverted introverted and would like to spend alone in time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my button.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believe that many customers that he meets with the YouGov-profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and have led to buy their old albums again.</seg>
<seg id="24">By the conversations that I have led, people usually have offended their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their panels to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to recognise that record stores offers a soothing community of equations.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers start the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overcome by the digital world and want to return to stability of confided records cover, from objects which are happy acquirant vigilations.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector so and I think it's so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with intellectually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "reddened a staff of a stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM revealed in April that almost 50% of the people who have bought a plate last month have not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The poll also found that 41% have a record player that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while I blazing a pilse of Bossa Nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (number of data: three men mean age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just returned here and said," "" "I have no turntables, but I would like to buy a radio plate, so I'd like to put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a great percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music clastig.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has been dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a poor audience than I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, teenagers and women middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above stores - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizers and sexclichter Pop, instead of experimental jazz drampered from the speakers - is it good to see such diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look very lonely, but brand mental traumas are hard to detectable if you stand for about 30 seconds in addition.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes in business and consider the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shovel bumblebee than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore the collecting of records is no real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a really loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the licence to muck the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teens to group up for a moment with Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left, there is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essentials for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are only pure decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to write them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry, and could send some customers to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the most suitable for luxury goods such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they let at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the Bummeln by Train stores of Berwick Street and the leaves, while the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false commentator who stands out about the shoulders of unsuseless men of middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live, settled in.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a hearing this week the authorities argued in Calais that the state should carry 72 provisional stores in which persons inside the camp products, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdresser services and sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or easy meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would be a parallel economy would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and medical risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important because the free meals that supported by the state-supported association and other groups are not enough food to provide the growing figures in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but cleared a fact that the concerns of Calais prefecture will be totally negligible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes, and restaurants would play a much larger role, as only people live, who live "in extremely preconditions conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by defeats, was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly used as well as 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice to asylum causes for hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minor age in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to keep the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that closure "for this children of a disaster would be of which the youngest is eight years old."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-year Rugby came to a corrupt stop during the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated by a score of 43-7 in Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a masterclass in the handling, side-stepping, crutches, scheduled race, and rower strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sunk by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, in this form a 15-man team had failed.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not be - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: fijis boss coach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult way behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">She lost Ryan every game eight years ago with the Adelaide Seville.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slipper will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji had begun miraculously and caused the attacks of GBS from fun shut down.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to top, as Osea Kolinisau attacked in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack in the right corner which he turned.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely has the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle Drop Out Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but it could only be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua lete in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prebroken through a further weak tactings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like it would be born in Fiji that 7 to play while GB still allowed.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is that way.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova had gone through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7 but the game went long in favor of the southern sesulans, whose fans cheered, swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to see the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame made the i-dot the dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff finds, the Fijis hugged and GB kickoff crushing in the lawn.</seg>

<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half of the front, but Dan Norton took the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no less than gold than in those games and what will be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes up to the last, 220 hard drives that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the Ruim, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainers Robin Williams was more present than they left for the second Olympics in the two without control woman, the first women in the history of British sports that laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.8 unstable use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlete who slide over the surface with the elegance of witnessing, reflecting not the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing, a battalion is content to content contributing to the difference which make the difference and it was not easier than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had the bladder cancer who is operable and that did them.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could be treatment early 2014, out of season, which could start the interruption on a minimum, if such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and running at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing on itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the intoxicity of victory, their initial idea went to Williams, who spent a irritant morning so that he was trying to speak anything else and thereby trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning who was the centurent of the Royal Artillery regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was this week a emotional wreck. that's perhaps a bit extreme, but it is so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would not have a better person for coaching or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponent could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join forces, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were really caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "lead in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to let themselves rest.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions on his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Bell must be on a wedding next week, their own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that that was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">London took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="13">The current president, Breitbrunner Mayor of Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set up in 1985 as a Wasserwart, and was appointed CEO of the Puritan Federation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"its tasks are very diverse and they stretched out from water management and maintenance activities on office and organising activities, the budget plan, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency notes on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events they called the start-up and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchasing activities in the area of the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the restoration of the high tank (1999), the new creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partition of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no lactation and I always resumed new innovations, because water lives and drinking water the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio she praised Göhler, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He worked with a lot of heart blood for its purpose-purpose, and he has lived for the purpose of water, as if it were its own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, he considered to present the success concept of the vacancy scheme for the nitratory reduction in front of the Aquatics district of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>

<seg id="22">He is the best waterfalls and he was a loyal killer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlights from his point of view, he described the well structure and restructure of the twin federation.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were due to the quarry at Kirchhof on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the villages with water could be looked after.</seg>
<seg id="27">Even the supply of Neubrunn one can only be maintained only because you filled the high tank of Pettstadt with hatches.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose was delivered to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds from Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-exploited and energy-based German steel industry remains unaffected by additional cost in millions of stones.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial loads that threatened the industry from the green power fostering are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains at the liberation of renewable energies in the emerging markets in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday, Friday).</seg>
<seg id="5">"I'm really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years."</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission had planned to set up the steel producer, which use gases in the blast furnace for power generation for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel sector threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there was now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with CommisCommissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel works will be replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this in the steel industry is not raised.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on its own production.</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that the status Quo's status is largely rewritten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Gabriel's successful efforts have a particular significance for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is the future' is that a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"further must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt, also stated in the reform of the emission of emissions," says IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel sector in Europe has been suffering from excess capacities and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation further intensified, as the world's largest producers in China, faced with the weakening domestic demand, threw considerable steel to the world market.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers refuse Chinese steel concerts.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the course of this spring, the situation felt something relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The import of import duties on imported effects, for example, have increased economic prospects in China.</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear, how sustainable is the price relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus ThyssenKrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Most recently the prices were more stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">However, ThyssenKrupp initially wanted to exclude any works of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of 2015, some 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increased orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">They produced from 3.4 million tonnes to six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the steel association was divided on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied all her life. when young girl was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "sing me - emotional and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">Quite by the way, she does something good with her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is equal to several perspectives: a great hobby for seniors, also Erhard Hackler from the German retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in a choir and share the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular merits, senior citizens can poppose and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because frequently solve social and family structures in the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to talk and organise themselves to be able to leave and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of the most part."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever requires his lungs regularly, doesn't get so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to get the sound of voice in the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, "Ursula Lenz works from the Federal Employment Community of the Seniors organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher job, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, explains them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often proves that singing or listening of songs in older people are waking up many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and particularly melodies, people disinfected oneself in demeningform of self-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the singing, the head also demands special power, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, focus on his own voice and on a given rhythm, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone, do not only practice themselves to concentrate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in a choir, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem grows through the singing in a choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I try for something long, I'll get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You are not singing - at 50 singing people, who hears, when there is a clay to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the matching offer, seniors have various options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone from the acquaintance circle in a senior enchanting person, you can simply connect yourself.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="32">If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn right into the church or the church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many veterans "fans can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the Internet may ask family, friends or neighbors for the help of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing, should necessarily connect to a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something free - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="2">After several regional offices, the constitutional bodies provided a group under observation as well.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see at the 'identification' movement 'point for efforts against the freedom of democratic principles," Constitutional boss Hans-Georg Maate, the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, immigrants will diffuse Islamic belief or from the Middle East in extremly way.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is why we observe the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "the" "" "identification movement" "" "is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">She is turning against "Multiculti-Wahn," "Uncontrolled mass immigration," and "the loss of identity by survivors."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional Protection in nine German states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the "identification" already.</seg>
<seg id="9">Maate said, his authority has closely matched the country's decision.</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government-spikes have been given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to the pressure of their predecessors, an optimized picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>

<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary of Defense at the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the news post office published on Thursday their own findings, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom created a fully reduced trial for the creation of nachrichton assessments on Isil and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest ranking Democrat-Committee, a member of the House of Representatives, Adam B., known in an opinion.</seg>

<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon's General Inspector, which were included according to CentCom's complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press pretener of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of Congress during the investigation of the General Inspector still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations against the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a assertion that is now made by a growing number of relatives of the defence ministry).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have dropped out the question, President Obama has relied on Central Command for honourable evaluations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA won fourth match in the field-hockey women, showdown a showdown with great Britain before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot down three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two gates in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever did.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal to their group with the Britains in their first place, which remains undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will be a strong Dutch a little longer from the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising huss about their success story, four years after it landed in the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years in hands (her two older sisters played the Sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as it couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team got everything wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work story in London, which we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rudder completely around.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback from the close area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had left the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed herself surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lute the ball into the gate to procure the Americans a 2-0 guide.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, it's too late, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel durable and unavoidable, a race-run forint between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is offered by Armbrusters to the Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting time in Coffeshop, without hearing from Simone Biles, Katie Lefony or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of black with dimples, could absolutely be sent among these well-known names that would be sent to Prime Time, accompanied by sponsors and chariot-TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Ftrue.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampolines around gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is illuminated not every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports that are not universally accepted: air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should go modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline was already an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been sparsely perceived that many people, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA has sent athletes as a competition, it never won a medal in the trampolines until 2012, who made it until the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for both men and Chinese and the Canadians to share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outer edge, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a Clownsschule as those that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a little bit of enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous teats of its never to end scouring brimming - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which is as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">The winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a series of falling movements (turning, hreal and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympics, they are rated as execution, degree of difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic Vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists need to go further down in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes go back and back to the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the starting line, but in the TV transmission another one-term goal: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streak is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a viewer too tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I sensitive to see these games as a little tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers an atsink.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is up.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the objective.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumped off, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, then downwards, then downwards, then effortlessly again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty but during exercise there is no hektic attack on the target, no expanse in the distance, only the dreadful, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's like Zen such as the competition at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final results of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will exert the final as part of a night event at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlook in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness is only achieved through anxiety and objectification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his new fan base, according to The Wall Street Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, long a ally to the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, demonstrating political changes in Ethiopia, struggled on violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tiny protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia doing just together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid trade union with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the past months, protests against the government struck the country and spread themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed around the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was ruthless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot down unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably taken from the past or earlier this year, show how security people strike young people with pples, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demands an incoming investigation now.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services are closely associated with the Ethiopian, to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded its remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new campaign in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Similarly, Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - Human Rights Organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country were limited, where dissidents were put into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, driven or driven into the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you prefer people and don't have any other options besides protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints covering all kinds of land-use and cover to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following an extensive criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this hacky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts agree that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, were forced to exploit more or less, the turbulence could benefit and rearm the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitors after years of age can now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, cheaper smart phones were increasingly becoming more common and improved its Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locked the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still communicate via internet proxies, they hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians at that they gathered themselves so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since its own prospering the Amharas, who predominantly come from branches in total of Christian countries, in politics and the economy, while they captured the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowlands areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing right now.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are on co-ordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos areas.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death at a non-publique illness in 2012 Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could remember corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that it was particularly understandable to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractors to work opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime will lack this fundamental feeling," "" "Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unattended reasons to take on the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam come from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he is not the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the outcome will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the analysts, apparently by the government, and subsequently stolen from the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razor, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development of development experts Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, as well as the new Pendlerade, as well as for their measurable progress on the poverty level.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal aboutart of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it adopts a dangerous form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of print protesters in Gondar, a amurous city, owned by Tigray, and the hatred toward the Tigray becomes more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests in the US and other western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights via the neighboring Somalia, although they recently hasted that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want to interact his ally in a volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">This, "Mr Abdi," is a very thin Gratemigrated. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explained his assertion Obama was founded ISIS is a sarcasm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy over the last controversy by giving his campaign by repeating that his multi-repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification threw new questions concerning the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellowsoldier, which endeavouring to take him during an eventful period to explain in the actual position, statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After explaining the election at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he was really not intended to signify that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he is simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to do something that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS would not want to know the Republican Presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism spelt down to Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling refractures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the business situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Telling about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals were lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm into his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July he attracted strong criticism when he said the Russians should let Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he declared "Of course I meant the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rowing them back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it is one of its methods to test how certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive, and then may be" "" "clear" "" "according to what reaction." "" "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, closely observed the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think it's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defending the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump responded to an even corrosive tone since its refractures went further back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a guided tour in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally tried to excuse his provokant statements, he accuses his critics to discerate his testimony or to understand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he stands in focus of attention over the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Truman Scherze have brought his loyal companion to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent scientists, gave himself great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backslider, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream-Republicans try to argue that the Government of Obama, in Mrs. Clinton, served as Secretary of State, eliminated ISIS to spread the situation in the Near East as aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ahead of the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and threw them out on each of his words and to be condued against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">He defied the "poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand and said, "They can't!"</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked because Mr. Trumps apologize for just another evidence that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrates is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually come on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hazi was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on the ship Shiff Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swim with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only got with 150 years of young offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark is swift along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is on average 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a whopping 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This silly-shaped lifestyle seems to be a bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen wrote by the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Sinners from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means vertebrates a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland will become rock.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland is hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-sea front of the sparsely populated coastal regions of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know correspondingly about the lifestyle of Greenland-haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-pentulo measures her, when they spread six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, this sharks make this sharks too: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed up the jaw noose of a young cone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt for sleeping animals or patrollers at the bottom of the ice-sea and search carcasses, that swings from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch of the North Atlantic ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was 81 cm long, while the biggest 502-centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens core with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks that are contained in the proteins later no longer.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly high Carbon-14 in line core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as atomic tests try larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters, the lentil core contained a low excess of Carbon-14 from nuclear forces, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday at his investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core that is created by cosmic ray in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 watch showed a 493-centimetres long Greenlandhai an old of 335 years, while the record-Hai is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenlandhai-females then get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters will probably be determined on the threshold of sexual mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Grönlandhair is obviously at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalves are mostly living in icy waters, is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland, in whose neck was a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to low temperatures often the organism from there are living animals on sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">It also mature later - and alers slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal covers heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on how many generations have as early as possible," "" "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, however, should rather invest in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="8">The third place is disputed among the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left hand would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the national parliament.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was, according to projections of a new NASA climate model, probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on using tools and algorithms to resemble climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus can be identified with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have a thin, erddy atmosphere, and nonetheless slowly turned around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved to be more dry conditions than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accomodate life and shake fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus had also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS range simulation, the slow circumstance of Venus its daily page of Venus had almost two months," explained by GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio to a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella due to the surface of a bulk of the sunbathe parasols.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles Evolution, which was preceded by Planetarium researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years, was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned down by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydro-departed, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly green effect -- Venus, which we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Welcope telescope has helped astronomers in order to collect the most complete catalogue on rotational rates among the stars of the stars.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help the astronomers understand why stars in starloops are rotating at different rates as well as in the context of the emergence process with the planet Earth.</seg>
<seg id="4">We hope that through the comparing of our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of his solar system, "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infra Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, originating from approximately 125 million years ago, reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn right now on the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At top rates, these mature stars encounter large quantities of star fades.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because these winds travel through the stars of the stars, they have a slow effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star alerts, his rotation rate starts to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotational rate of every star, putting the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunglasses --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalog of Rotation rates indicates that the more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, while larger stars slower than smaller pirouettes.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Ballet" of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, clear, whereas faster Rotors tend to be very bright stars, "said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare performance qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of extortion malnutrition are currently targeted company - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malwarding specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 per cent of surveyed companies were at least once, some of several victims of an attack with blackprint software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies have already been target of a ransomce extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willing to resolve the charges required by the Tables to be able to utilize the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their extortion software according to the observations of Malwarebytes and attacks on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed there, the potential loosening money will be considerably higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a frightening fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Maldives have been designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the express software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the goal, but the change to company attacks was scary quickly during the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it looks specifically for unlong-changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransoms and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final turnkey code, the victim will need money - usually in form of value added Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private use the personal photo database is on the game, it goes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage will fall when a ransoming strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to undermine business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients could be threatened through the loss of sick.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims," don't pay, you only promotes the problem, "says Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet, 80 to 90 per cent of the companies paying, their data get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult, in view of stagnation in operation the demands of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, security researchers from F-Secure have studied user interfaces and contact with the agents and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to make more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, set free inaccessible support websites or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed to be paid out of a few hundred euros, companies have to deal with hard-negotiation and five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the Ransomce Erexpress, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the job, explain security experts Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomce about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely that there are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their failure software in the form of a software structure to the actual extortion.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is a adaptive tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Bupressors are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums on the underground, the set is buying from a criminals and sends another software to install the software to many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per employee calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals carry Spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies's IT developers responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust Ransomce can be able to repel the back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"when the encryption of data is not sufficient for successful replacement, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the sluggish potential depending on the type of data a multiple times higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take up entirely new goals on the Internet of Things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hacker conference, Defcon demonstrated security researchers as they could have been using the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the clichary of a so blocked heating so many victims could definitely be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually been extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although only 1,60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have lots of space in the first row and in the rear, it seems to be close to any location.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasant, only the cockpit-top falls down there.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical, than it sounds: seating area of the return bench can be folded like cinema boilers and offer a storage room which is high from the floor up to the ceiling 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, however, the load level with 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V thanks to the torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speeds of up to 300 Nm.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he thought his work is slightly quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine version: a 1.5-liter gasoline unit with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive will not be offered.</seg>

<seg id="19">The City emergency assistent (operating until speed 32) is one of the collision swarts and the track assistant.</seg>

<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller is responding to the traffic knowledge and impenselt at need for speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is only available for top facilities: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and HDMI buckle lie below the armrest and are therefore something cumberable to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel engines are fine.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening it gets caught forever, at night you wake up awake, in the morning it's already far from the wake-up clingles to think of sleep anymore.</seg>
<seg id="3">That's all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, it is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleep disturbances and more than ten percent empowes their sleep frequently or rather relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and it can cause them varied causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeg, member of the German Society for Locomers and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand, however, is the Insomnia, that is an entry and sleep problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially that can sleep through many people as unsatisfactory or insufficient, Jens Wagnecht says the board member of the German home medical association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind Sleep Disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological, or behavioral factors, however, can also be used medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep problem expressions of any other condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is often common in depression," says Weep.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors oppresses each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lay bad, waking up every two to three hours and starts to salvingly, about everyday problems and care to salvels, give wisdom an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Whoever doesn't sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week, and is compromised on the day, should go to the doctor, does Weep advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: it is smitten, tired, unmarked, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep problem, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medication - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and for a maximum of two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Located in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University of Berlin, is hardly emphasized.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at first one should turn problems with sleep problems at first, does Weep advises.</seg>
<seg id="24">You can clarify your studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in sleep laboratory, and what happened?</seg>
<seg id="26">For checking in a sleep-laboratory medical profession, for example, in snoring with breathing, in case of illness fatigue, at bedtime or if you don't find the cause of a sleep problem, explains Fixing.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not have a midday hibernation," says Fixed.</seg>
<seg id="30">After reduced, one walks into the bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body one is wearing sunglasses, a chest strap and a fountain on his finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">She also paints a camera on the ceiling of sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get rid of the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are pretty many screwdriving up where you can attach for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Neither counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, not sleep on the day, don't watch television for sleeping, alcohol to avoid drinking alcohol at the clock - then you start to count immediately, and that's all at all.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilt, a few lime trees, in between yet another headstone pavement: the Rigaer street in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight not so, but the police counts them to the "dangerous places" of the town.</seg>
<seg id="2">When you walk along the east along the east, one comes along playing fields, a freshen kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">On the facade of a gray house somebody has "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite the Lidl, which is to be dismantled, it is already built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new tenements will be created here.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district," as the responsible for the company Friedrichshain, will be prefers with burning cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor are premises guarded and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, at the beginning of the year, the Berlin City Centre has repeatedly been responsible for a tough approach to the police, which was called "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the cadets, cleared with 300 police officers, had been patched by police officers and three weeks of official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crewmen on site, closed parts of the road, and stopped to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative District Court decided that the clearance had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and habitations.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents go with children walking, people sitting on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others conversing in the late street.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects there are primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the principal concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who are three children, are generously generated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a "Kiez, who wanted to offer a majority of police protection from vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which of the Berlin City Council and the police officers, make up their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin actually was a traditional labour-quarter, which is today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also houses and native projects belong to the "Kiez:" in 1990 many homes were occupied in the former East, including almost all the Main Street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainframe was cleared under large police force in a real road battle, many of the projects were legalized in Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who were occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the district in recent years has become increasingly become a magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: now they share their residents from East-times and former home-etzer their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable even when renting cars, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in designed slices or freshly painted facades, which were subjected to colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street has been mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason for that not all neighbours may have this as a problem, it could not necessarily be affected by crime: crimes such as body violation, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make non-damage, which tend to meet newly built and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 years, cannot be heard of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violent actions, it is crucial: people in the 94 are their neighbours, who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars admit it right in the Rigaer already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the German architect, their street is not a criminal incentive, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is conscious of the thoroughbred road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That's why it was so important that local residents returned to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, which claimed the interpretation of the city in July all round.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road will still be taken away: through uncompromising newbuildings in former construction gaps that push the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee contractor</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the response partner for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee contractor for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social pedagogics supports the management of management around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as the contact partner for all actors: refugees, workers refugee aid, administration, authorities, and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the Working Group indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the greed wooldau that has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked than the multitude of relevant assignments - meant, as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, an eiving wool milder.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is necessary to organisation, work with people on site, and behind the scenes, as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place to be limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client, Annika Deuschle Ehrlich and full official actors support." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Coming soon, new containers are located in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been found since a period of time to find flats for the connection people that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection assembly.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for building, rent or renovation of these accommodation must wear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the counsellor to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not everyone landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been made very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private homes.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work until now, so you need to rely on private apartments so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, Community dwellings need to be respected as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and subsidies for refugees and migrants who have to be tiled or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places were good," reports Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homestar, perform charitable work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work for the community is leading to a positive aspect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But that's not just work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">Humans would have to develop a concession.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here management and honorary posts.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You have to explain the refugees that it will take time to overtake time, for example, with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever makes the feeling of evolution, he could not help in Urbach, I should not work and be unprofitable, I will never be incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem cases, however, does the customer be honest, "people who do nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer may always be motivating others.</seg>
<seg id="47">Everything was already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do they have fear of radicalization, even in a small community as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine tells quite clearly, "what mancher can call naive." a rest of the risk and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitively to be sensitively aware of the helpers.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the assassin bring them completely in obituaries.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary site must look for activities and in the region according to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new shot could be coming to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clear, the politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them on-site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes clear that the Urbacher even utilized to integrate the existing people in sensible.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both of them are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
