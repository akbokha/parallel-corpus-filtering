Obama welcomes Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not straight @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran on the dest@@ abili@@ ing action in the Middle East .
it is said , however , in the encounter with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been spann@@ ed for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the constant sett@@ ling of Israel and casts himself a lack of approval for the peace process .
through the deal of Obama , the deal concerned the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Netanyahu had kept the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress held a controversial issue , which was partly fav@@ ored by Barack Obama .
the speech wasn &apos;t spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with indication of the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in a call , Professor , shot his friend to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Sullivan , with a fear@@ ful voice of the police , told that he had shot his friend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house , the officials had read the bodies written by Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I could reverse it . I loved Amy and she is the only woman that ever loved me . &quot; this stood after information by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb running in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , Mississippi , had already left 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police according to the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the Vienna employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has taken a cat@@ astrop@@ hic score at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police settled him .
a day after shooting at the University , students and lec@@ turers , forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to raise a picture of it , the Lamb is motivated .
the details of the state published at the two ends of the state , including what students and staff who knew him knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students told that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said that he did not have any history of violence or crimin@@ als .
he also mentioned a book written in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both sub@@ ordin@@ ated in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some til@@ t to be problem@@ atic at@@ titudes .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , the Lamb pra@@ ising , said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had related stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he only spent two online courses .
the latest amendments noted in the employment policy of the University , that the Promotion used for the Lamb was so hard for him to be no warranty for an automatic way to which Assistant Professor Assistant .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that will not respond to the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , police found the police later to Lam@@ bs lane , when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ a Johnson .
his car ran even in the entrance .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla L@@ ston said it was 15 and had been 20 when they met by common friends .
they and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy , who tried several years to teach her the guitar .
he was the skir@@ t of the woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls , when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously a couple of time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no wonder about a marriage .
you had a dog called Light@@ ning which was living with them in the brick house , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met a lamb but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail took part in a summer fair for three years .
later they played together one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , his daughter writes and sings its own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse that worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he had finished runner and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s night at night 5 September after he had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ ate audience .
there were no signs for something there was not right .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the scre@@ ams and were jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized on American citizens and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the students committee .
on Tuesday night there were about 900 people attending the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle of candle .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the remin@@ ders , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return to our students , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police finally says that he had shot dead in his emergency call P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , but there was no indication of him that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox : &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were waiting in the theatres on the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is adjacent to me , and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated g@@ aps and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .

UN CEO says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will disp@@ oss@@ ess violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all the parties , including the shared United Nations Security Council , to unite and support a political solution for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of the five standing member countries of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the outskirts of the general meeting of the general meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ rection in the Council , and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they have demonstrated to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 re@@ frac@@ tion@@ ate values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand@@ new him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges at p@@ olls down , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys exhibited Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the odds of the nom@@ ination of real estate .
naturally it is too early in the electoral period .
nobody asser@@ ts that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts , that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys gained leadership to the adv@@ ent Herman Cain , of which there won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ side groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth have now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance , and start to flow their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey values indicated that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps Ac@@ quisition have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy to mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
early August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early States .
in I@@ owa , the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac system has observed the last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of ro@@ gue .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with aging as candidates .
in a CNN / OR@@ C survey , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans reported that they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; enth@@ r@@ alled &quot; vs. 40 percent that would say the same over tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Est@@ abl@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans looks no m@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the US Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a pre@@ sidents , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality of a commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that it did not have the personality to effectively implement his ministry , and nearly six of 10 independent claims that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the idea .
when they set up their v@@ aun@@ ching , republi@@ can voters are tr@@ ump for real .
if asked who won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination that most likely won the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say CNN / OR@@ C from that last week , four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time , when four of the ten end of July will put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters were not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in recent cycle , four out of ten Republican women , Rick Perry won the nom@@ ination would win only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a ple@@ th@@ ora of GO@@ P voters are a plau@@ sible campaign than plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans collect a different candidate , Tr@@ ump inspi@@ res almost everybody .
some experts refer to the fact that the fra@@ gment field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is spread across more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump which re@@ ap the majority of women .
he took 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would win the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a suc@@ cin@@ ct majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Fans say that she formed her mind .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump will say that they have been awarded their voices .
naturally , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they were open the door to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with dr@@ ump on immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump made a debate on his election campaign two months ago , the Immig@@ ration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course in 2016 was on the public dis@@ course .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expressions of the Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the re@@ orient@@ ated efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with dr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to seem to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , about half of the support of Republican voters , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , spur@@ red all of them by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mont@@ es@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience .
and they are even mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ Republi@@ cans were fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ thing there is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
the street costs an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros on average in the street .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; means , therefore , the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers are one square meter of the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top resorts , one of the price comes first , however , like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Service provider Angel@@ s &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ ings in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several ten thousand euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford to ...
by the way : Munich here is an exception here not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream star@@ tup thanks to Müller and I@@ ze
double tor@@ ques in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky number from Thomas Müller made FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 near Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it was running .
a sovereign start of the Champions League @-@ season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have made a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; of the FC Bayern in the witch ha@@ ke of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their overclo@@ cking play in the Champions League at the Greek record meister in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Sac@@ red hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th strong success in series aims to be the first step towards the finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola wants to finally fet@@ ch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Mu@@ eller received his 28 hits in the Champions League at the Bayern @-@ Gui@@ ded Mi@@ Aid of the Olympic Champions League , Roberto , who left one as flan@@ k with the shot of the world champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised in front of the game in Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium prior to 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich staged word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance , without spar@@ kle .
Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) arrived here .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams were un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victims .
they went brave , with their offensive efforts , but often too sin@@ less to work .
the attacks were often in@@ stituted on lin@@ ks@@ out@@ wards Douglas Costa , which was seldom used against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ ks hit the right hemisphere at the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the potential 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms of Ide@@ ye Brown beat the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct influence , the ke@@ epers did Roberto with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavarian van@@ ished to their usual game , Pi@@ raeus was able to set a needle .
but to Tor@@ ch Manuel New , he was promising .
as he did a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te l@@ ete ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chor@@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Sac@@ ze , back to muscular problems back in the ca@@ des , first sat outside .
the World Cup team only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; Sports subur@@ b Matthias Sam@@ mer said in &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to do something else , that &apos;s already v@@ icious . &quot;
for the first transition , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the An@@ de@@ jected Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9. ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and later made it all clear by El@@ f@@ meter by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller again .
before the game , T@@ ie was ready to play in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly twi@@ sted Bavaria @-@ fans in their viewers @-@ blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went out with the mu@@ ff@@ les against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
at least one Bavaria @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
anyone smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
whoever smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this also puts a vintage @-@ long study .
the good news : at fault falls the risk rapidly .
smokers should have a mark@@ edly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this study goes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several contribut@@ ors to the German Institute of Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , the risk of losing their teeth is higher , in order to cut the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
scientists have observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
major causes for dental out@@ age are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the relationship between smoking and bi@@ d@@ ration can therefore go back to frequent fl@@ esh@@ g@@ ing@@ itis in smokers .
in this way , smoking also increases the risk for dental c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking by smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
but it could go over ten years until the endanger@@ ing went back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first au@@ tor Thomas Dietrich , of the English University Birmingham .
you have to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smoking , the Master &apos;s head of the DI@@ f@@ E stated : &quot; we have shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and leads to good health health as well as to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ als , DI@@ f@@ E was divided .
previous studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early dental out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study covers the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
for the sharp@@ ening of the war over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private sha@@ dy facilities for disp@@ utes between companies and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which is clearly more traditional in its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that believe the citizen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &apos;s responsible Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström won . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Schwe@@ din proposed the proposal to negoti@@ ating the EU negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP should also be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure are obvious that the EU states and the US jointly choose their new investment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new investment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be part of the EU , the United States , and third countries .
it is planned for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
so far , the pro@@ ced@@ ural operators were agreed on arbit@@ rators , they were unable to decide upon their jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice .
in the long term , she plans to put her own information to an International Investment Court .
there could then be clari@@ fied disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration method ( IS@@ DS ) mainly requested by major concerts ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the major reasons for major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ers are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the Company &apos;s compensation of tax pay@@ ers , the national laws or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in first opinions , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act put the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ sufficient .
critic@@ ises import@@ antly , that it should not be applied for the already handled free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , oppos@@ ites the plans as a great progress .
the Commission was considering essential points , the Federal Minister for economic affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring , with other EU @-@ trade ministers .
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Company Trading Europe warned against pulling all the charges of economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thus be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it .
when talks on the TTIP talks concluded over the Free Trade Agreement TTIP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) continued un@@ clear .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States so far .
originally a context for the agreement is already at the end of this year .
this term is regarded as no longer viable .

the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he rel@@ ates on the reviews of various places he always shows on the map , where his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and z@@ art arranged songs report .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens inv@@ ents as a wonderful creative mad@@ man .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart composed songs that harmon@@ ises himself very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time in the great opul@@ ent drift .
it is a rum@@ our that , &quot; Michigan , &quot; the first part of a we@@ ather@@ proof series : each of the 50 US states must be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and breaks out positively .
if Stev@@ ens stand down here .
live very enough guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians who live in New York will be returning to the series .

the album rises to the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of the most influential music media in the world .
after an extremely productive experiment , Stev@@ ens then reli@@ ed on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively .
this sixth record studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all the effect and hall .
the stage shows far from the smaller club , the stage shows are used here for brigh@@ tly colored spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ Stir@@ n@@ b@@ um and tall fluorescent stages .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band in Germany .

at the beginning of March , Theatre presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although nearly 2,000 guests have been ban@@ ished in their chairs , the well @-@ known Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without creating a word to the audience , the group excellent musicians play through the broad @-@ rich album .
the audience ob@@ serves : the talk was &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and it could be dis@@ car@@ ded about the sla@@ b in essence . &quot;
only adding to an addition , Stev@@ ens feels modest , plays an acoustic few older songs and ultimately eng@@ ul@@ ls beneath the applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ b@@ da made his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s budget
Mr Cor@@ b@@ da &apos;s debut has been eag@@ erly a@@ waited since its election at the Prime Minister &apos;s Prize
the new master @-@ president Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n will win his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Prize and became David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will ex@@ ert to check out the first of its six questions shortly after lunch , with the performance of the media most likely and the Labour MPs in the vicinity .
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could safely ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary report for Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s leaders , because it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , and after his appointment at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision on Tuesday caused a commem@@ oration to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to silence , critic@@ ises from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several fron@@ ts @-@ news articles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s decision to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence . &quot; he was acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ b@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national hym@@ n , &quot; ir@@ respective of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ en top team , and they were calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as a leader .
the political dent in the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political dis@@ agreements can be stacked in Labour &quot; and Mr Cor@@ b@@ ying statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of applicants .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to set up Labour Chang@@ es in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very clear that they are only against the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the title of the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he is a T@@ ory leader , over the decade of discussing the Dis@@ patch Box .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the members of the Prime Minister has become a confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has under@@ min@@ ed with in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties and to focus on serious problems , such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle , who is represented by the shadow of Economic Affairs , when he does not participate , for example , when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues can occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters . &quot; but several years later he realized that he had failed .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the delegation was viewed with the Prime Minister as the principal bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership among his par@@ liam@@ ents , although critics have argued that they have become a caric@@ ature and require considerable reforms .

between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this rate was the quick@@ est and produced ass@@ essments at the time of a interest increase since 2009 .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed by 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump from 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

according to encouraging News Bur@@ berry stock , Bur@@ berry shares were higher for luxury goods at Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0,9 % higher .

nar@@ rated by the level of Lebanese on potato cris@@ s @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the potato fo@@ yer , which the Ol@@ den@@ burg I@@ mb@@ al owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay , has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the movement of the movement , Al@@ hay potato has put together meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea brought him a poster at an on@@ ida demonstration with the wor@@ ding &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen randomly in television .
since then , a barbecue grill , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; Al@@ hay says .
the idea has meanwhile suffered from the Lebanese man to register in the Patent Office in Munich .
since recently , according to the authority , it has been protected as utility models .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay wants to tell .
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also come along with its customers .
Met@@ less starts Sanc@@ ting So@@ aring campaign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ less tries to protect the IG@@ A @-@ stores in front of an Al@@ di summit in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ large tra@@ der met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ resistant campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are prepared early next year , Met@@ als and IG@@ A markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice @-@ manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distri@@ butes stores and shop owner , who sell tickets for the South Australian soccer league for loyal customers .
it is expected to publish Met@@ cash further details of its star@@ base strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will be running on food , alcohol and equipment for the annual investors strategy day .
it is much on the game since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern States .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as compared to around 14 percent in Eastern nations .
yet , analysts as Morgan Stanley said that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets in these two states , Al@@ di is going to take away only five percent of the grocery market in these two states , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
according to a report published in this week , analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath was estim@@ ating Morgan Stanley in fact that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 US dollars per year , and Met@@ als could lose 250 million US $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
due to the loss of food and grocery and the amount to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base , Met@@ als could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ als lost market shares in the Eastern States , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the most notable ones .
Morgan Stanley indicates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and market share expanded by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , related to a business meeting in Melbourne , that met@@ al@@ in probably will van@@ ish within a decade .
Met@@ als rejected it to respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash associated with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 IG@@ As market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which has approximately 1,200 K@@ A retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction on profit@@ ability and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler denied himself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to increase selling prices with col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products worth every week and IG@@ A retailers in improving their shops , improving fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adap@@ tations and store re@@ tool@@ bars are to be released and hopes that major whol@@ es@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise to praise for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly rather praise his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is referred to as a &quot; Special KS , &quot; came out to the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gy@@ ros with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in Cincinnati , Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , where Harrison proclaimed : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike her child , and I should punch the child . &quot;
while he has seen a tennis ra@@ cket , as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp won a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the second behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I feel rather drow@@ sy , is the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi was drawn up a little bit into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a tie in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat with itself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deser@@ ved much recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very strong and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own inheritance .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the final decision on Friday and describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right to all but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm to returning to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and didn &apos;t open all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ ros &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe Nick has made a very rapid rise in the eyes of what people like spring and Murray . he goes into the eyes of the public , but we try to make him understand@@ able , but we try to keep him the consequences of his action . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares war , stops the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and landed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the parties who tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos arose at the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serb police re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence fled for an unknown period in a country strip at the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from protest foods and water .
Ser@@ bi@@ al &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary would come from Macedonia while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must take talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40.000 people who invaded the invaded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement was agreed that the EU countries would receive a further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not put his hopes for a quick action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities in two southern regions to defeat the crisis so that they could accelerate independence and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ ey , said that his country is also preparing a bar@@ bed wi@@ z@@ a@@ ard along its border to Romania , to stop the stream of migrants by the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata told that even prison activities were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
over the past few months , Hungary has become a lot of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war @-@ wing , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , to build the government along the southern border of Serbia to establish a crime . these laws also bear more pen@@ alties for the traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of the Hungarian Government , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said S &amp; D spokesperson on his residence in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must not agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , the country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people attempting to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come from , because they damage the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of crimes committed by crimes under the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence fast .
Hungarian civil servants closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a mig@@ rating car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos has the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pushed a crowd to drive there .
about 20 managed to enter but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they could travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s head start in a national pol@@ l in Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continued to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the previous @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who still does not declare if he is can@@ di@@ fied for the presidential office , support 15 percent of the Democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is established , which candidate will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are qualified as one of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost some of demo@@ graphic groups in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton inter@@ l@@ ates a big head with women and don@@ or , but its origins have decreased .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders are just returned with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit of democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has become vol@@ ati@@ fied , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton still has a big head start with the older voters .
in the last month , Clinton had his second @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 point lead in this group .
in the country , about half of the democratic party voters say that they would support Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter were to support them with some of them and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters can be impressed by her .
the views are more powerful with those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would it enthusias@@ tically support .
while 48 percent of the voters say that Clinton can support him with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say that he is more than a top candidate for Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the most common answer , that it is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that it is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters can also support their link with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the ass@@ aul@@ ts are also cited .
as the vice president acc@@ uses an potential for the Presi@@ dency &apos;s office in the Wa@@ ag@@ ulation , 57 percent of the US voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are in demand for the elections , who would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be a second choice .
bi@@ den decides not for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s head increased ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has gone down from 78 percent last month .
bi@@ den is a second with this measurement , but the percentage that has be@@ holds him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
however , during the question of what is more important in one candidates , Democratic voters call questions about the p@@ us@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month , no single democra@@ t candidate or potential candidate for these voters were prot@@ ested in the election .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in elec@@ ting voters of their party &apos;s pre@@ elections .
look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong guide qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den will best deal with hon@@ esty , whereas Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion about him .
democratic elec@@ torate in the general election may also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic party has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and an server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic voters are still happy with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions will not be influenced in total .
but it is another story in the American public .
half the Americans are un@@ happy now with their explanation , while only one third is content .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy has no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
more re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this remains a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to voting for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voting licenses can also be regarded as non @-@ honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump received good notes on leadership .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best given to hon@@ esty .
a majority looks like sin@@ c@@ ere rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many of him have no opinion about him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the preliminary election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on for longer survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of Donald Tr@@ ump on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times .
on the two candidates , half of the voters decided in the new pol@@ l , and others lose weight .
Republican voters continues to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was undertaken before the Fox News debate in the last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed 6 % in the same period to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well @-@ met for demo@@ graphic groups and ump @-@ ump on republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ es , is with Wiscon@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who dropped by 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor of J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio situated 6 % on the third place .
the error margin on the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of the Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son is going to p@@ olls - in 19 % support in re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly before Car@@ son .
looking at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump picked up a number of side@@ walks for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ umps on the question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bath temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough to reach hot water .
a bathroom in North or Baltic sea should be a short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some of you are not going to the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in that week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bath temperatures in contrast to the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ comer
two years after a student handed over a student group in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder is filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an event ritual performed in September 2013 and delayed their transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand , and had been attacked , while he was trying to access a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was s@@ wo@@ oned and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
they , however , had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to get his symptoms of goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to escape the Council , Mr Wagner told Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide , and introduced the welfare of the Brotherhood , written by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has repeatedly been attached with the power of injury of the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; to many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury found a charge for the first five members of the Monroe County for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with a criminal attacks and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; we do not only want to make responsible for the involved persons , but if there is an organization that has - officially , or un@@ official - this has been sanc@@ tioned , so we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood is calling for their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a Zin@@ c hike is coming , and the ly@@ sis will fall into the wan@@ ing board , ren@@ dering to the bonds , and the economy will gli@@ de into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long will it take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process .
recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve during raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing the economy and financial investments .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank is so severely stressed that investors should not concentrate on how they start to increase interest rates , but rather to the period which is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could however determine that the entire excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a Zin@@ c hike .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is un@@ avoid@@ able of some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal ups , but still on low level to take into the seis@@ mic shock which many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a glance based on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the market last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest in interest can make things for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to ins@@ ult total orders from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happened after interest rate hike of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly in the upward trend during the past 35 years - approximately 14 percent - on the way to zinc hei@@ ress , fairly flat in the 250 days after a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s Asset Management .
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the shares ten@@ ds later in the concentration camp , and the return on loans are beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of business life , but Zin@@ ovi@@ des promote them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not exist before and accelerate the recession .
most remark@@ ably is that the gross domestic product is in the near its lowest point when there is a Zin@@ c height of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest income amounted to just below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect that this will take effect and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rate hike with such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and throwing the question as if it is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year made to a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all the eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases cycles carried out from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing capacity during GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ itals very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , this is a clear recovery of what was the worst recession in the observ@@ ational stage .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ atile , because the market takes a interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic circuit .
in bonds , the ren@@ dering appears to switch the direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the production cycle , the loan rel@@ ates immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates may result in ren@@ dering earnings from longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a down@@ stream of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analyst at Schw@@ ab in an analysis .
interesting is , Jones means that the markets have already adapted to the F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the strength of the dollar and the drop of the inflation expectations there are some evidence that the market adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the income scales is flat , bor@@ der@@ ers have increased , and the vol@@ atility have increased - all market characteristics when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ened its strategy .
in large and all , companies that un@@ roll the larger part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products can become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse since a value of rising its products on the global market is more expensive , and equally the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet companies have exceeded the average interest rate of interest after all interest income in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from increasing money .
savings could see profits through higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of his &quot; stup@@ idity . &quot;
he argued that he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also re@@ signed the BBC Music Awards , telling that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ itated .
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins took the programme The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader , and increased new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does something whatever the private station does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
con@@ doms of the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station is pu@@ di@@ gest@@ ed &quot; and increasingly do not differ from its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ pl@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also invited the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you are actually im@@ itated on what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is in front of its commercial competitors , when it is about live music and education of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and on radio 3 &apos;s commitment to finding new music and give new works to be commissioned , I really think , &quot; he said .
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder it to work to engage in the public as it did so in the past because the British became inform@@ ing more about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport that fell under fire , the commercial ri@@ vals imposed on the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins took the Voice to - the musical talent shows of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George were a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he would like to find that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our house @-@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it star@@ ved the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or give money to the charge of charge for other maintenance formats .
Internet sales grew at the slow@@ est down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for that
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the recording of records in 2000 .
online sales rein@@ forces three years ago by using cell phones to store
experts believe that the Black Friday will change the issues in November
for more than a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets transformed itself to pure city cities .
but experts say that there are now indications that the online sales are stagn@@ ating , having new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate , having new numbers shown only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ selling complex in The Guardian , has always been developed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it declared that online sales were driven by three years ago , when buyers began to work with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases from this event , which will take place in November last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers to sell their bar@@ gains around their computer to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers had collapsed .
experts believe that Black Friday losing the buyer with a bar@@ gain , a buyer who could stop doing their purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium have found that £ 5 spending was spent on a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than a third of the shopping is now carried out on web shops .
at the same time purchases over a quarter of people &apos;s clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains .
Muslims buried in Mecca by the crane accident involving fat@@ alities - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are attributed to Muslims in the first mor@@ als in Mecca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia uses the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that altogether , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims assembled when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury them that were killed , when a crane collapsed in Mecca .
smoking filled , largely in white dressed , the track to acc@@ use their respect than the first of the dead lived their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z cemetery .
the pro@@ c@@ ession went over to the Holy place , where only days had collapsed a building crane by the ceiling of the mosque and then on the lin@@ king .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi @-@ king over the construction company of the bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded , has imposed a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 che@@ ers who were killed when a crane collapsed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ka , were carried by the streets .
among the dead lived Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram out of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ach@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual p@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that they will continue to continue to Mecca according to Mecca , hundreds of thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden , would not have been admitted to the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency of the news agency did not tell this detail , however , that the company &apos;s leadership abroad must be forbidden .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man landed what caused the fall of the crane collapsed in a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims left in front of the H@@ add@@ ch which will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has given no statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree is also reflected in the group because of non @-@ current security measures , and because it does not co @-@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is managed by Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a dead child who was disp@@ oss@@ essed from the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash occurred in the middle of strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of each healthy practice .
officials said that 158 people in hospital stay in hospital .
representatives of affili@@ ates that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the killed are to pay and the same sum of permanent injuries .

B &amp; Q boss says the time of cheap East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople are over
British employ more and more skilled workers , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this means that there are 200 other screens , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Britain con@@ serve her h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen that carry out work in their home
if you were sent to m@@ ash with a hammer or a brush to stretch walls , you belong to a minority today .
because British increasingly employ workers to perform DIY jobs in their houses , the chief of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ standing chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services on civil prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shop plans to open the department of craftsmen and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men are ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
she said it was necessary to provide the growing demo@@ graphic trends that feature more female single @-@ households that are more popular than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ri said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger towards a equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
generally , half of our clients choose between women and 80 percent of their decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in decision @-@ making .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of one British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed company , has also re@@ directed its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company which is exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - Di@@ versity is a important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group posted the costs for closing of stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
functionality of a@@ I / DO@@ B concerning del@@ u@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Regional Court Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball player Vice I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and judicial authorities .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority .
in May of this alleg@@ ation he was acquitted in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the general prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the investigation that the accused were disp@@ le@@ ased in the years 2006 to 2011 of the Constitution required to disp@@ ose them to their functions .
as a result , he acc@@ eded to approximately 400,000 Euros .
the sports officials are also charged with tax exp@@ ire .
this fact was the chairman of the Senate committee , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence explained that the association never materi@@ alized any more time .
the sport func@@ tionary would only have allow@@ ances and the sport club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money from the liabilities - the liabilities were approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; then we stood in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or lock up ? , &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the breaking of the month of breaking the financial system .
in his co @-@ def@@ endants and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot down money , put our life insurance as a security on the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made .
furthermore , due to their financial financial success the withdrawal of allow@@ ance had been decre@@ asing until 1991 .
therefore , I have paid a portion of the allow@@ ance only years later , namely , from 2003 , when an increase had been paid to the account .
therefore , flat @-@ flat and non @-@ detailed bookings seemed to be explained .
the def@@ endants &apos; accounts and spar@@ row par@@ ted together the two def@@ endants , the second accused said .
why the compensation for the club had not been manifest@@ ed in detail , the judge asked .
the organisation wasn &apos;t interested in detail for finance , it was important only the debt of debt , the answer .
in 2011 , when an investigation began when investigations were abor@@ ted , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the national bank account .
these were the def@@ endants , the def@@ endants had been declared .
this attempted bank retained the name of the second accused , and was not known as the association according to its asser@@ tion .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
the survey did not know for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have realised something of that money , the prosecutor turned into the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been informed , the function@@ alist was true .
this assignment has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation restoration . &quot;
why is repar@@ ation ? , judge and prosecutor wanted to know .
the first accused stated that he was not admitted to this formula , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? &quot; he asked .
furthermore , he said to the officials , he never conf@@ essed a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
however , an account for di@@ ets he charged the club € 1,000 per month , but the actual work would have been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not suggest the accused .
these were according to an operating examination , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer been kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ ination had also included the second accused .
all per@@ missions are in cash , in addition , he had to leave out of his home town international market to lead to Blei@@ burg , in his testimony .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police attacked the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and water designer against several hundred wounded refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the violence at the border control point .
he reported on telephone :
a group of refugees came through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and behind the police officers a water designer was ready .
40 to 50 refugees spi@@ ed with stones , b@@ umps and plastic bottles .
the officers were initially set up with pep@@ per@@ mint mark .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .

the refugees have now re@@ trac@@ ted something .
a pregnant and obviously bur@@ dened woman was removed out of the zone .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ rupt@@ cy
the world is watched when the US music Bank has two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest will be raised or not .
a pol@@ l of 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned about Reuters , found that the F@@ ed is going to do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue longer and remain the interest rates at present rate of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event , because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates at NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively high performance level , trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate only one low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances .
they warned the markets , facing an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances are being good against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death sho@@ cks at Delta State University left a letter of debt
after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi , Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague later on the day he wrote a note to say that he &apos;d &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could un@@ do so , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said , he was shot on someone , and he was slain .
on the governor , the staff said that police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one bo@@ thered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb issued no explanation for his shots .
when police came to the scene , they found Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s &apos;s body , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Flo@@ od jum@@ ped 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing before being transferred his own life on Monday evening when police ra@@ ced him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s also had a relationship with Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no evidence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ que relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was written by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married to about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to the statement of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s who had a dog called Light@@ ning had met a lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Jonathan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police ra@@ ged him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , Lamb ran his car to the side , and fled to the woods , killing themselves with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doctorate in the Delta State University , how his life was awarded to the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group of corporate income .
a half @-@ billion euros in the year wants to save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization .
the world &apos;s 150 executives around 1000 executives will cost the work@@ station .
with the pilot project , there is no new negotiations .
the Lufthansa reaches its structure of companies and enhance the Euro@@ wings .
the result of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of approximately € 500 million a year made of cost and discre@@ syn@@ ergi@@ es , divided the airline on Wednesday .
amongst other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer have a board of board for passenger transportation .
the Euro@@ wings budget service should be designed as stand@@ alone as possible .
in the board team headed by Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Um@@ adt for Euro@@ wings will be responsible for their wings .
with the rev@@ amp , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operates under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which produces three quarters of annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the pilot of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations with the judicial shut @-@ in strike on this Thursday shall be resum@@ ed .

the theme of the talks will be the retirement regulations for pilots .
in a year with a projected rec@@ or@@ der@@ result , &quot; Cockpit table &quot; comes to sustainable results .
the conflict between the union and Air@@ line led to a number of strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pilot the savings concept &quot; Wings . &quot;

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for many fra@@ k@@ tur
Luke Shaw , in the Champions League of Manchester , suffered a double fra@@ grant from his right B@@ one at the Champions League of Manchester .
while def@@ ending the left @-@ ending champion for wines , Louis van Ga@@ al gave it up for at least six months , giving it up again that Shaw will be able to play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rest@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw held in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has twice a fra@@ grant and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United has it very hard and then fantastic and then happens .
he had a oxygen m@@ ash in the dressing entrance .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ grant , it will take 6 months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the hanging of a river of Als@@ ace .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how kap@@ ut I am , my way to recovery begins now , I will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke at the defeat at the PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive to recover until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ o , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this sort of injury to the place , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to off@@ end an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break out when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital , according to an oul@@ dering of Chris Sm@@ alling .
you certainly knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents want to learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it nearly heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to die in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it &apos; was a difficult election , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to give my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the content of the book , instead of re@@ iter@@ ates the new characters and details , added to the fairly brief original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is , and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to see their desire to see a real tree , &quot; reads , &quot; he read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss whose real name of Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and who died in 1991 , is totally unknown .
as if that had not yet been susp@@ icious : the text of Cameron presented itself , partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is shown on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams .
although he promised to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron does the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment will be for@@ ging , thro@@ po@@ uring , sni@@ ff@@ ling creatures , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read the Lor@@ ax after 20 times a child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons election office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons has been delivered , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still difficult
turning to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series does not appear on my map .
I would not exclu@@ de an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is possibly much less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any s@@ cars from 2012 , but only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops himself as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related to this news : Adam Ly@@ th has separated from the United Kingdom @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course to be difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ te@@ ers are in@@ geni@@ ous results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - player their own best choice .
long ago it had been extended to the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully suggests another number of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss is comm@@ ended his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t bring so good achievement , and it surprises me ; he &apos;s above all a team man .
the question of how much time does a test kick help to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton won nine .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one could rise was that England first put Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean at first - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a striking which I am strug@@ gling .
he &apos;s a X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season , when he achieved a response to a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances of the same chances before him , but this depends of the team effort in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , mos@@ ques next to Cook suggest something which would get an extra spin @-@ in bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks , I di@@ pped , and I did nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot hit there , and those left @-@ h@@ anders has already shown that he is a devil @-@ player from cri@@ cket .
Mo@@ een probably did not finish his job for Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire County , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my former team mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first lap before he joined as Op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made us and looked back .
Z@@ afar Abdul@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited work with him he impressed me very much .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , who raises her hands and the coach did decide for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart ad@@ ditions while exercising .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be an advisor for the trial games could be a master coup .
he is one of the most powerful not@@ ch of the game that will bring an abundance of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is used for the white sphere stage and brings energy and a powerful application in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international Cri@@ cket Contest , when players or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela has st@@ aging insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the one @-@ Day@@ ers , root has a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with this .
some do not agree , but co@@ aches and team controllers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as in players don &apos;t depend on results .
such decisions are not taken in light heart .
Bre@@ xit ( a Bre@@ xit = Foreign direct from Britain from the EU ) could win in subsidies , if the economy becomes a fl@@ au@@ let by 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ il@@ ted new negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU , even without having the choice of genius &quot; Is it &quot; Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely beaten up on Tuesday because of Europe .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at told me that some member states , so deeply upset in various crises such as the EU is now and not always out of own fault , Britain &apos;s own agenda with divided conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive contracts , which mostly don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at their annual meeting that it doesn &apos;t like it when it destroys the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at Summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , coming home and say that they would win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who once looked after the great Britain within the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and goes through that more and more short @-@ wise ministers and officials came to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them as it did in the excessive swe@@ aring like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a pale force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist state government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear down a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be used to prevent her energy from the UK - something they do not want to do because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies did .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers need not inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ end@@ und@@ campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend is susp@@ icious .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ dge , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how to miss the Fle@@ et Street on its own expense and what EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as it wasn &apos;t inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 and supported our entrance to 1973 with a 2 : 1 relationship .
you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name for himself as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels over the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his fi@@ del@@ ity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
for that , the Med@@ ley was assigned by tax @-@ car@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the p@@ seudo non @-@ foreigners , most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about her , but realized that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread the ban@@ anas in order to stop him instead of having dinner and dinner .
in fact , the Mili@@ band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he turned himself Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s refer@@ ral verteb@@ ra@@ e , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved Constitution adopted in 2005 , which subsequently opened to him a back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to spend more for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck Boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch .
it may take time , but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he abandoned on Sunday .
Cor@@ bl@@ an &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll put it in a friendly way - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ u@@ b@@ stoff trend and the wild vessels of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week said , as the boy sc@@ ou@@ ting in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father worked on television to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet counterpart , without going too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed itself - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his competitors and members after all reports on Monday evening .
what ever wants to conv@@ ey the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of television around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a ticket to Europe that allows him to give Lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ums for self @-@ comprehen@@ sion as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental affili@@ ation to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite @-@ capitalist economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate on left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of small fore@@ fathers is a central basic principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities in Nato - Tom Watson , it is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for the outlet - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin turn into political capital - they even have mi@@ tig@@ ated voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the USA are already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , in which I was remin@@ ded of something on Monday that was mentioned on Monday of the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers told researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , began to critici@@ ze by critic@@ ise the public health care by public health ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the power capability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading editorial in the medical professional journal Lanc@@ et last month fought the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily &quot; basis , &quot; which he justified his final conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on proof of its effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions about the damages of different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ half products to synthesis ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss health , whose managing director had previously received the British American Tob@@ acco Committee ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained that funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer was given , but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to be maintained .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide commercial financing on paper .
some other participants at this meeting aren &apos;t known for their know @-@ how at the tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he also took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research team is characterized by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for damages of most products at most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations in the P@@ he report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rub@@ b@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had responded to the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are modest in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to information the public on what evidence shows and what does not , especially if it gives so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people are dying every year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system £ 2 billion a year .
by the clear display of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should quit East@@ l@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should quit writing programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival will give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee will only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast through other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial times of time against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broadcasting services such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC executive director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tries to come into contact with the BBC for six years .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or transm@@ its , which would also be shown clearly from non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations@@ Committee under his investigation into the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I think mid@@ - or long @-@ term stay not for a good idea , you should have the production at least on programs , the other doesn &apos;t work or order .
you send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is obviously nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ side is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I try to see how this should be publicly @-@ true .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s blame on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to safegu@@ ard long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ am gart lecture show in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ l@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ IC Program &quot; on BB@@ C4 wouldn &apos;t be able to measure it , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue that if they have created their apparent missions to justi@@ fication of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these top programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the panel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can receive the best value hier@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you are all thinking that you will receive a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who &apos;s £ 150 a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 Chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday caused the BBC to check their her@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , form and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said only little by the BBC production would now be classified as a formation . he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on radio and in Canada , an example should change this in &quot; inform , elabor@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC , should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders alli@@ ances meet to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by waves of sound
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ ds change the direction in the moment , ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have been bred using genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by particles of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are going to have sound frequencies for the human hearing in order to be heard .
the impul@@ ses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified in order to wear the membrane channels that react on ultras@@ ound .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , used by ultras@@ ound , in order to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ en@@ an@@ th Chal@@ az@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the trial of a day may replace the depths of brain stimul@@ ation , a inv@@ asi@@ sive process that prevents electrical impul@@ ses into the brain of treatment of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
F@@ aden@@ ei@@ mer normally does not react on ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultras@@ ound waves , then penet@@ rate the worms .
the intensi@@ fied ultr@@ asonic rely on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the waves are the opening of this ion channels and enable the cells that they are linked , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he turns ultr@@ asonic on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms , where they are changing their modified mot@@ ions .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to shift neur@@ ons with the Imp@@ ul@@ ses of Light and to eliminate .
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asonic tissue can be hin@@ dered , and can be sent to the brain from above on the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus there is possible to temporarily hal@@ ve the cited human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Khal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; they made a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture machines at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need is a move of the British government and the guarantee that folders are not illegal before our door @-@ door .

eight Golden rules for life in student residence
eleven years ago , I attended a student residence , 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the attached smile of those who I &apos;ve been upset - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve lear@@ nt , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the student residence in student residence is ranging from slightly irrit@@ able up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ att@@ ing : people telling where you &apos;re coming , where you stand in reference to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you say , &quot; honest , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love to hate or hate , because in Ernst , Boys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through . breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask Questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find people out in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were in fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people let humans .
people of people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people join in and their under@@ wear .
here : don &apos;t forget to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough handling at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship more , but you have to go away so I get the energy back that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a compromise is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send SMS to his SMS .
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student residence , had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start the Uni at the peak of the back man@@ ie , the clo@@ ak is at the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have some cra@@ ck . so , and now please smile , if I put you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to include friend@@ ships .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves , and perhaps to associate your face with a marvell@@ ous surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed sh@@ ump with flour , sugar and fat make people even stand sleeping , when you shr@@ ink .
ste@@ aling food is an extensive crime in student residence .
of course , the chicken of hen is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check it with the breast@@ ownership .
chances are , they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with so balanced one as my ro@@ omm@@ ates who added a washing machine to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , which keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being an employed person , but that you are in the true sense of a saying to people who are sitting in gl@@ ash@@ out .
a girl on my hall asked her neighbors whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than it was at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded with still loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before joining their own music , shut their door and went on to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your sp@@ ouse would take into the same student residence at random ?
vice versa , it would not be pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ed , if you keep a fellow worker for your future sp@@ ouse , will take her back and see them every day and perhaps to experience the way they pass over all their shared friends ?
of course , the heart is his own path - but if a hot fellow country@@ woman is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to talk a little reason for your stay .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in its not closed rooms , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing being more than it seems .
a good swe@@ ep is funny , but it takes just moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
simply share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never swe@@ ater to someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but fli@@ ck@@ ering your poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all@@ ou@@ tra@@ ps , and long @-@ den@@ ser
the real estate developers Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds inside the central Eck@@ es terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dor@@ m rooms , but as well as the only survi@@ ving mother and the Ger@@ ping @-@ earned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to grow and build good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being in the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have sustainability .
because people are staying in a large part here .
given the refugee movement , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a whole , three @-@ storey bra@@ in@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
this is different if you under@@ scores the people living in flats .
each of the six houses built just in the pilot project , consists of three living units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt easily after the respective requirements .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without plot .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction has taken six months .
that is appropriate .
did the building legislation be complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : under construction , I moved through my project correctly .
especially difficult makes it always the ug@@ ging Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ wand special construction and the pitch disorder .
gr@@ assy design .
the apartment is still underground , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their town@@ house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who accused me of making luxury goods for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not correct .
but did you not tigh@@ ten the launch of affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however : for the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford an anymore .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room .
not just fu@@ gi@@ tives , but just as the only survi@@ ving mother or the Ger@@ ping @-@ earned .
I show how to grow cheap and well @-@ build today .
therefore it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you will give you the option to download and then install .
some problems came to problems due to the installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either to wait until the storm hur@@ ts or to try to update on iTunes .
the telephone itself brings you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has caused the more likely to do this through the getting of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install the process once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the up@@ dating , or in the vicinity of a loading device , so that the battery is loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not allow the update as well as the telephone may go on half @-@ way roads and might result in a departure of the updates .

bad Kissinger Schach@@ club has an emin@@ ent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ fre@@ unde Bath Kis@@ singen &quot; created three months ago , and added another member in its ranks , so the number of participants raised to 19 players .
the new member is the business@@ man Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen at K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the sponsor of the 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and Lü@@ b@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Kis@@ singen with a donation , which made the chair Alfred Klein .
therefore , it is possible to include chess players , which cannot record the membership fee .
youth work and talents are also planned to be driven forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friends of friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ Weiß &quot; can be seen as an expression of solidarity with the city .
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro Your direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft was put together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new start at the Graf Stau@@ ff@@ enberg site .
besides consultations , you can also participate in courses there .
the Social Foundation is step@@ ping up from the mountain to the city centre .
more exactly said to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg position .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ um was opened there recently .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , pension@@ ers will receive information on questions such as care and nursing services or nur@@ ses .
since years we have been engaged with our out@@ patient care service , that often other nour@@ ishing members are left alone .
there are countless many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many benefits of the insur@@ ers cannot be used , because the complexity of the insurance cover is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the new master manager J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible as the executive director of the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alongside the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Community also offers prevention , health centres and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the benefits of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new Qu@@ arti@@ s offices in the city centre will see both of its leaders in demo@@ graphic change .
because this is a good de@@ central infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future is essential .
moreover , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) set out at the opening ceremony , the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ field also dedic@@ ates many events and offers on the program and they invite for a regular scre@@ ened flame . &quot;
therefore , the Social Foundation makes a great contribution that senior citizens can live independently and well in their intimate environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Dr. Frank Müller takes the practice Fel@@ ris@@ otto and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen .
also concer@@ t@@ master crafts@@ man Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the country doctors tend to be missing - As@@ endorf is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ris@@ ons on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing in his successor in the next few months with half a place to the page .
after a conversion phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest EUR 3@@ 10000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was a sympathy at the first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship is met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed her medical examination in the hospital , which is also involved in practice in practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was ready , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller made the idea to run their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss .
and so one was settled , the m@@ iller bought the house with the practice .
in addition , they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
he grew up the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller , who grew up in various medical practices and hospitals in various medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel .
he is currently working as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head of Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ read@@ iness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ er works as a house@@ cian , his wife V@@ sel ( Inter@@ est ) speci@@ alizes in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as veter@@ in@@ arians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 year old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we offer more ultras@@ ound examination as well as long @-@ term and power @-@ up EK@@ GS , and need for more speaking rooms more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renovated .
a supplement of 50,000 euros will get the m@@ iller within a support programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; he st@@ resses the general master crafts@@ man Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter in the practice Fel@@ ris@@ otto , approximately 2,000 patients come to live in practice , in the Northern German average practice it is about 500 .
there are still another home practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect of the case by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , it would have gone .
those who visit Mü@@ llers are visited , Inci@@ dentally , in confi@@ ded faces : takes over the seven medical specialised , and the cleaning power of the rock bars .
their farewell ends in the village of As@@ endorf . after all , the medical profession is prac@@ tised for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ isti@@ ble sm@@ iles .
but after the long time , a little melanch@@ ol@@ ly sens@@ ed it after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is compl@@ ying : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I was pushed by hor@@ tic@@ ing activity , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls were driven on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Internal Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inspec@@ tions on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants an asylum application can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept infinite migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
a controlled approach needs .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government previously announced that Slovenia would leave for war refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and we may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees under any circumstances .
however , the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see this however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather be monitoring of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians will have to pay for refugees in refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system couldn &apos;t work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government had ha@@ sted , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in East Croatian border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid registration .
the Croatian police managed to attack them in the near corn@@ fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles cont@@ ested with new refugees .
it mainly concerns Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
there were also buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian Serbian border that previously carried on the Hungarian border to Croatia , informed Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to propose the people to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; was called .
according to media reports , however , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the town of Si@@ d , throughout the day , further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the passengers were travelling around the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia all night from about 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary agreed , so the police told us that we are to drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , it could actually be a slightly ahead displacement of the previous Balkans route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country had prepared plans for the fall of a strong inf@@ est@@ rogen of refugees prepared plans for possible exceptional circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not name , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lead strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . the EU partners have since launching a good testimony in the country since then , as regards the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ a@@ ean site stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ mu@@ au@@ n about 300 refugees .
according to records media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border crossing shifts in the gos and the back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
if the remaining fu@@ gi@@ tives come further to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local table in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
there is , however , not to deal with very high waves .
it could not be said that if they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
aid to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute the refugees maps , where alternative routes are marked through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border there are still 20 years after the end of the conflict there was still not cleared mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police informed that a team of mine@@ fields in the border region was sent .
stock @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians will pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is alleged to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber@@ crime criminal , who is accused of having bor@@ rowed an insight into more un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR New@@ wire .
with the captured information , insi@@ der stores are supposed to have been made to the financial markets .
thus in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our country are ultimately captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SEC message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further prescri@@ bing in the event continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to be ag@@ itated in both the U.S. and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice support Mannheim consists of 20 years

the people do it with their permits , partly quick pac@@ es , partly pret@@ enti@@ ous .
you control the two stops of the Mannheim Motor Show at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the rail@@ ways are holding .
pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ one life at stunning autumn sun cou@@ pon and afternoon , four big boards always with the inscription &quot; Before I die &quot; ....
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiative brought attention to this action on its twenty @-@ year anniversary and confron@@ ted definitely confron@@ ted by mixed responses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is life , so we came to the action in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Guide of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ itals will also offer the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks , as volunteers .
while some pass@@ over spontane@@ ously attacks the chal@@ k and pro@@ claim the sentence of &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can continue to stop &quot; the war , &quot; or are not long , &quot; others stay shortly , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then continue .
again , on the outskirts of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with death .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realise that , at some point , the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly . , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is in common with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Association of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice .
so this public @-@ effective action is therefore good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
however , that everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets , be understand@@ able , finally , it was a very personal cause .
the subject of death and death was lab@@ eled as with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the tro@@ users movement just contributed much to the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years that people open .
an estimate , the Angel@@ ika Go@@ dem@@ and@@ roid shares .
the death and a c@@ utt@@ leb@@ one belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confron@@ ted by personal experience with the theme , they read plenty of literature and decided to engage in star@@ vation efforts .
after the &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ er Remedy , &quot; she was seeking a volunteer , and was immediately sign@@ alled by the creation in 1995 .
Go@@ dr@@ on belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z St Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ etz may well deal with her task and the experiences made experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point of waiting , it is for precious and treasure the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply of out@@ patient &apos;s E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical host service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations are facil@@ itated for training as well as training and commission of death and funeral .
every two years , training courses are offered for new employees .
the boards described on Saturday are now in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1a ) and the home of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there can also be other personal wishes on postcards .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ Ex dis@@ reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the supply chain gains its profit outlook for a whole year due to weak@@ est demand for freight service and higher costs in its transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers on vacation .
at this point in the past year , Fed@@ Ex has announced that the company wants to take up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell to 2.5 per cent at the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysis expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower average will be increased in spite of price increases , which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective January 4 and , despite the higher sur@@ charges for boxing , heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that despite the previous year , the result is expected to increase the result of cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid earnings , &quot; in terms of increasing economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations have been announced one day later when the rival UPS announced , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
in the fourth quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex amounted to $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research asked analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks in@@ quired analysts were expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has given a decline in high priority products over the past few years , receiving sales in its unit Express shipping for stagn@@ ating .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex .
sales rose by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was in fact flat with higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell because of higher labour costs .
in the market trading , roughly one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares decreased by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
at their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the lead for the first time since almost a decade .
imp@@ ending over them at an end of the @-@ plated , two @-@ story seating concept is located there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices to keep stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ defeated third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate , the X factor in a decision may be too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be spo@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled interest rate by the near @-@ current rate of interest since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets are already anxi@@ ous to strengthen this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za said leader in the bro@@ il company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text , rate the interest rate , the increased uncertainty is around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed is doing what is le@@ av@@ able in itself the financial market .
approximately half of econom@@ ists , which were recently surveyed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate that week .
financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed with a key indi@@ ator that shows only a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promise that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages around 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy predic@@ ts the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , CEO at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she should go very well in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t have in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate hike will calm down the financial markets , because they will deal with the uncertainty when the F@@ ed will act .
another month , the F@@ ed appeared on good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ elles had said that despite the statement of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition is anticipated .
although the job creation has slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate declined to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and in the proximity of the level to address the F@@ ed as full @-@ time employment .
wage increases have shown evidence of recovery .
although the inflation remained constantly under the current target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them for the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media .
but the financial markets all over the world got together at the end of the month after China had util@@ ised its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages occurred in May by more than 16 % below its highest level , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would slow global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , the Dow dividend is now nearly 10 % below the h@@ ype of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , market turbul@@ ences influence complex calculations , when should the interest be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of US music Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the principal markets of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included in the decision @-@ making decision .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere critic of the former Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could hit their mon@@ ary expansion . &quot; carried out confusion about the globe .
in a world where the markets and economies contrac@@ tu@@ ally together inter@@ tw@@ ined , it can not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments at other locations , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of excess reactions to finance market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , representing a interest rate hike , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tivity by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a significant impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ ack@@ ers said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representative made these cuts backward .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability just during a heavy crisis , such as the 2008 market break , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ences come not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a interest rate because the markets felt exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of the time .

Brazilian Society for Pa@@ edi@@ atric Cardi@@ ology , Rio Grande , promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pop@@ ish Organization SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women on a sho@@ cking way women , how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with frac@@ tures of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers vary , their daily cal@@ orie intake increased by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that the mothers should be carried out .
a current study conducted under the leadership of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy eating of the child may influence the immune system negative .

the planning for the long @-@ a@@ waited turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports ground step forward by step forward : in the latest communal lounge , the executed building was finally blessed without great discussions .
previously , the panel , among other things , had decided to apply an application for a dedicated &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; liberation . &quot; from the valid building plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was only allowed to permit a special form for a special design .
therefore a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof terrace &quot; are set to be erected .
background of the planning is the planned use of the solar plants for solar plants : &quot; by doing so we have a wonderfully major South @-@ roof &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; again , it dropped to the roof of the roof that was prescribed for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below the age of ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning permission should be no &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the grant of the Bern@@ rie@@ der joint at the rule , more restric@@ tive from their applications were more restric@@ tive .
there is no recur@@ ring project at the gymn@@ asi@@ um structure : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the sports centre is a joint project between the congregation and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are calculated to approximately 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and latitude .
in the next pro@@ ced@@ ural progress , construction application for the 18 x 36 meters high hall is now presented to the Council &apos;s office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and majority of employees are pulling from P@@ ei@@ ze@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district coun@@ ters , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , confirmed this .
however , a decision on the Supervisory Board , and the t@@ ask@@ an end on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were implemented , all the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue .
the vast majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing center to Sh@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the employees who don &apos;t have to go to ch@@ ong@@ au , will be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff are informed about the plans .
triggered the change on resignation of Dr Andreas E@@ der , who is only a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic only since the beginning of the year , and now moves to a private practice in immediate proximity to the hospital .
when questioned , who will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared itself ready to take over the line on 1st October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , in any case , this was an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in internal station of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board has ended to con@@ serve both homes , until then next year the former hospital of the rat@@ ern@@ ity , which has more than 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ze@@ berg after almost 140 years .
the administrative district had planned this in 2018 , although the currently ongoing renovation at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital is completed .
the J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White Land@@ lord , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , joined the rum@@ or that the house which is owned by the federal government is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I close this close . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several reflec@@ tions .
there is currently a short period of car@@ itas and an Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry in there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better couldn &apos;t happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the House in which Fischer has worked as a chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ze@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again in recent decades of closure , sections were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people killed and have thrown their cor@@ pse into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman was found on Tuesday evening at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , who shared the public prosecutor and police on Wednesday evening .
as a researcher , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old also applies to the appointment and investig@@ ators wanted to identify and investig@@ ators wanted to identify the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been noti@@ fied at Sunday &apos;s morning after she had not arrived home on Sunday after visiting a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators wanted to appear on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
during the friends of friends and friends of the missing students , a crime committed against the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds were finally revealed .
the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the bodies were found .

the 20 year old should be conducted at the port of the port , and the investig@@ ators forced him to burden .
in fact , the subsequent investigations should indeed be revealed .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the location on the German residential home market is curious .
more and more refugees seek a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution of the German residential property market has long begun .
with the coming refugees and job search from the EU , more people push for a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens to pay the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
on this result , a study commissioned by the project &quot; social housing &quot; .
for comparison : there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many will drive in the home market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers last year were to rent .
however , the negative development of housing market is , however , not only in the rising refugee .
the study also makes significant failure in housing policies of recent years .
Germany is a housing deficit which becomes bigger from year to year .
at present , some 77@@ ,000 units already failed in the metrop@@ olitan areas , including Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many appe@@ als were living in large cities in major cities .
young adults stayed un@@ willing for the apartment market un@@ willing to stay in &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per capita has declined in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing &quot; suggests a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives are set to stimul@@ ate social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved on the property tax , and the deposits for publicly sponsored apartments may be suspended .
in addition , according to the Alliance , event@@ ful tax @-@ amor@@ tis@@ ation opportunities may be necessary .
refugee programme for refugee within the state bank Kf@@ W has already been working well in cities and communities .
a good week after the start was finished Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have a free money : Croatia and Slovenia are sending a corridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary after Hungary , and more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces , the transit across Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les to the North .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate via the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organise a Cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Health , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees forced to Croatia to go to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
on the day before Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws , coming into force on the same day , are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first number of refugees at the Serbian Border at the Serbian border in Croatia in the morning .
most of them were reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they were both with the bus and Tax@@ es in the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to go on foot through the green border to Croatia .
the refugees on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border were not restricted to gren@@ ades .
thereby the boundary strips other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ fields do now quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border , Hungary comes to Hungary after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 known people .
shortly before gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws repe@@ ats over@@ coming and damage the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as an off@@ ense .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned are pen@@ alties of up to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Camp , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers have been used on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sessions &quot; border with almost all - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicant are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has granted one view to granted asylum in Hungary .
after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the right asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to wake up workers .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish which had left tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
the lat@@ tice were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the border was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the aim of this reconstruction .
Austria reached only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
but in the country around 20,000 migrants still held their country in the country .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
on the morning , the train service from there to Germany was stopped at the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor stepped on the Border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stayed after the bridge on Sunday with the rooms , when suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ springs at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So W@@ ern@@ st@@ one mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany surprisingly had sl@@ ashed on Sunday &apos;s traffic accident with Austria , in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered down his help immediately and who came along with two other sho@@ res and their cars on the border into near Pass@@ au .
previously , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we said the same way , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was obvious to us , &quot; says the city council in O@@ Ö@@ N .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that has been very pleased to us , &quot; says the city council .
the ranks were turned on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to follow the road traffic to Germany , but still on the fron@@ tier .
but the regional train was replaced prior to the inn at W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm linked with the Bavarian neighbours began on Sunday , days before a two @-@ breed athl@@ ete - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
so that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends an additional Z@@ ig@@ ot to us , a logical conclusion of the apparent policy is :
instead of building structures in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , our Federal Chancellor , officially approved and publicly tra@@ cked up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Soci@@ alism .
suffering from this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions .
also the poultry people will need to be aware that the &quot; praised &quot; land , which they invited and welcome , has nothing but a further refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge , given the continued refugee flow and the approaching winter , to make decent conditions for refuge in us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be another bigger , peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad at the search of 35,000 winter@@ ing quarters
finally , Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is always there that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to raise up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad has already received a grip .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees came to Austria on Monday was without a great vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prot@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ known situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5,000 quot@@ i@@ als are calculated in the hot year at a time .
in order to fulfil the number , 35,000 housing must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to make the states , 15.000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
with the state prisoners , he already led talks .
they would have secured it too , even for the coming refugees to create Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Lower Austria it is good , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Man@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , will be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations submitted to the asylum coordin@@ ators as well as the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
we are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
in emergency hours , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must hold a certain height of hand@@ bag holders or mag@@ nit@@ es .
for a temporary time , &quot; not@@ standards &quot; would need to apply .
unlike the interior of the Interior , he was successful , however , Konrad is justified with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , which one does not yet say without further into the face of un@@ truth .
beliefs is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er no charge of the Republic , as they declared itself .
their workforce will increase to three to four .
the individual search search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container on a st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
first , no opening of municipal sports facilities and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , since the victims are subject to measures without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for an emergency , additional sites will be checked up on your capability .
critic@@ ised the city &apos;s criticism of the distribution of refugees inside the Federal Republic .
other areas must also contribute their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Federal Minister Josef P@@ ten@@ inger ( VP ) announced his request for further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er has assured me that German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic would continue to be possible .
however , there are the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany would not give it any more .
the search seek@@ ers would , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
among other EU member states , P@@ ag@@ inger once challenged once more increased solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria will introduce controls on its borders , is a logical result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry Line is officially completed .
the listed IT Group S &amp; T listed in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative businesses from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies of the New shi@@ pyard , and later also escap@@ es them .
even from the start , S &amp; T collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours - in which Netherlands promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Centre , which belongs to each third of the city Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is provided by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as a Tech@@ Centre .
30 per cent of the living area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent given it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Ar@@ row

this project had to shift the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : finally , it has grown to grow in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , opposite business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is now shifting to women hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
extra po@@ ckets and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday , the new Shop has been in operation .
before , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; I was thinking long if I was to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
the decision was also decisive for the decision , which was also the Fur@@ la producer , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a very own site , where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only in the great space of Linz , which sell this trademark , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ interest has laid por@@ it from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most suitable for me when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some women looking at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist will not answer with recent security .
maybe it is because a nice bag is enhanced every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property connects directly with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants U.S. president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses itself extern@@ ally in an international crisis policy , the candidates for the US presidential department cont@@ ag@@ ged the election campaign strongly .
and cut well off .
this is also registered in the pf@@ yl@@ lic K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate market come from .
the New Yorker finds a concept in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine route .
man@@ e in the 1200 inhabitants is more than -@@ zig corners to serve with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign .
the young painter Simone Wen@@ del unle@@ ashed a film about ro@@ gue .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that will somehow be exciting , but in its K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that is not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has directed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ ints , amongst which Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
though there is respect for the performance of the family but also ten@@ deci@@ de@@ dly the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big la@@ zy , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the sound city in a radius , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the investors , she says .
the tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened up in the US a shop for gold mines .
the foundation stone of the estate company were first property sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their wish to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian state in which the Pfalz belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once ruled out without permission , the director of the Institute for Wal@@ z@@ ische History and People &apos;s findings , Roland Paul , declared a film star@@ tup .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ going immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ochondri@@ al statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and asked the construction of a boundary wall to re@@ loc@@ alise illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ itely , it &apos;s not as sympath@@ etic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote cont@@ actor Tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker in retirement is fore@@ seen the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so mighty . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes from ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ it@@ sel@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters stated that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz Heinz came to a visit to the Church &apos;s organ , which ended very well .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
you don &apos;t find it better if he won &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; he has such radic@@ ally views , I don &apos;t know whether that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the shots at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a and Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;

critics have wondered if Thomson could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .

the woman , at the Sam Wood , eventually lan@@ det to the Bachelor , was covered in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left girl will certainly not give price whether she is the one who has received the last Rose .
but when we meet Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before being out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally tried a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood Com@@ es his lips to the Fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women agreed on ly@@ rical manner why Wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should become Wood &apos;s last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except ourselves - Mack@@ ay &apos;s best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a very simple relationship between the first day of the day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ il energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought it was pretty compatible with that , &quot; Je@@ bel &apos;s Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I &apos;ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit last week makes it clear that wood &quot; could be one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw it with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m still with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked for a Wood should be called , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be at Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ oc@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .

some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a little angel like it lost the ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ters at his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .

it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian wake @-@ up provider for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left playing the field and later she talked to the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which is coming now , you only cares about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

applicants of asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also asked more staff for the Board of Directors going to be responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ 9 theme has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the FW boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen will shoot at prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police g@@ mig@@ rate in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi District , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , chief district officer said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside a police station , with some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used tear gas and shot up in the air before they res@@ orted to rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse known , known from which they can be killed , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , evi@@ dently has produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protest at Nep@@ als southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ob@@ i say that new provinces formed in the context of the proposed new constitution would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in Western Nepal on the ethnic group of the Th@@ esis , who want to create their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were injured in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a controversial issue in Nepal is gover@@ ned over the centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the leg@@ islat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ islat@@ ure signed a week on certain sounds in the constitutional bill , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into effect on Sunday .

Google launches the double donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling pro@@ donations campaign , which is supposed to raise US $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , helping thousands of refugees to help European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of the Don@@ or call to his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family in Kabul , when she was seven years old , had her personal experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our journey many dark bands and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people look desper@@ ately looking for the help of my family .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : physicians without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google has said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / was raised to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

for easily over@@ ge@@ tic diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easy @-@ weigh@@ ted people with type 2 diabetes can last after a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s too early to say whether easily ob@@ ese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who get non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery which wrote a leading article to the new trial in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss - Operations or O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity treatment for type 2 diabetes have been proven as efficient , but most studies were performed by people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , compare two kinds of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes by people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of the non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ gone a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder totally dissolved and 28 % partially dissolved .
in comparison , the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group dissolved itself with only one percent in comparison with the diabetes , and at only about two percent .
moreover , the results were consistent with the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general is better in the &quot; surgical group . &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by approximately 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , increased re@@ operations in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and had more complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation goes to a longer life , Black@@ stone says from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent an obesity operation , approximately 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people who have a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; without an elevated risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and her doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have identified their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reverse is really hard . &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is subject to fiction currently in fiction : a young woman , to school times un@@ popular and un@@ expect@@ edly , meets the flock of her youth over years , and he is in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa B@@ inder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel probably should be interesting for H@@ uns@@ ett@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and rejo@@ ices in making her hom@@ etown a literary monument .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East would fly .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which has devoted himself to Ethics studies .
he requested that in these circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must reflect on long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine evolution , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
finally , we must think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in its countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved any issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama has said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that violent response from the USA went into a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he made violence , and that has unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants through children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ins centers in the USA reports a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve that swal@@ low an alcoholic in disinf@@ ect@@ ant , such that Georgia is Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from manual infection agents increased by children under the age of 12 , which reported to Tox@@ ic control centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common in these products and , unfortunately , a percentage of them will come in the notebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lopez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some kids are disinf@@ ect@@ ant to drink , while some of them do to im@@ press friends or because of a mutation among the social media .
videos on YouTube shows how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
juven@@ iles received anti @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant mixed with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lopez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
especially with infants , less sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky sitting around , but people let these hand dis@@ infection are within reach of children , and when children come from it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from strawberry tur@@ ni@@ ze in the synagogue , was brought in an emergency department for treatment .
her blood concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was combined with an adult in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ch physician who had she treated at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency department .
doctors overs@@ aw the night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma when the girl had fallen by alcohol and hit the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s Mother , CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;

lack of cover competition in Scottish football , boring Netherlands - de Bo@@ er
the former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have never lost interest at Celtic , there aren &apos;t any title rift with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it just like - but we have to go on .
we really need this year &apos;s support , because that makes the player better .
being released now is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to € 1.@@ 82 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the UK@@ s of 5.5 % , as the numbers of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed .
in the meantime total employment was in Scotland by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan for government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a drop in unemployment .
afflicted the ends of the process
as the security personnel was unable to control the situation , the employees called the police force .
only with the use of pep@@ per@@ mint , the officials could take the stur@@ geons in custody .

why then will I be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator at the death @-@ chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard glossary is executed by the po@@ orer .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first described in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applicants are available as places available , there is a mak@@ er@@ ere lot@@ tery place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites to five to five .
who is chosen , who will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to record a notebook &amp; a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to aband@@ on my im@@ par@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wishes it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained of that .
she spati@@ ally cleared , that it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporter to be present there to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series pod@@ casts I did .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ k would take him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary act .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I think it is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters , where you can turn .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man of feu@@ dal police ch@@ ase hi@@ jac@@ king to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he was talking to the guy from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man of Perth to hang up the police was un@@ successful , when he was found in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer , who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday at a peaceful fall incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
after the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I am not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy alle@@ claims that ste@@ wards tried to pion@@ ate him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy alle@@ claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy on its st@@ ables and threatened to end the race right away .
he invited the ste@@ wards and the integrity branch of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race @-@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday , Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he is always trying to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test at Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept himself 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fe@@ ed@@ ging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything appeared at once &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know there are widespread .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to walk erotic from the head , and I want my owner to think that I try my best for her .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I need to think of what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity section had tried to sp@@ it out his barn .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart , sitting in a room with a man - whom I would ren@@ ounce to give him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am an im@@ post@@ ure .
if that is the case , they should certainly hold its n@@ oses , because they have failed to express myself .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the Route L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were at the time aware and are still today .
should this affect me , that it will be personally ?
has the RV@@ L sustainable behavior , and perhaps people outside train@@ ers make responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I &apos;m .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but now I am at the point of that which doesn &apos;t matter for me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and pushing it , making a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it levels of train@@ ers have set up a cob@@ alt test with Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the conclusion that he could throw his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known due to its preparation of the non @-@ def@@ endant Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing daily treatment instructions &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack mud or sound had been carried out on the horse &apos;s ra@@ ges , which pushed the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I must assume the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my cow@@ or@@ kers has er@@ ron@@ ged mud onto the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day that it was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race day . an inquiry into this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need any rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals in case of represent@@ ations to ring fighting back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as a &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites in the N@@ RL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm @-@ players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm finale in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a clo@@ aked note regarding the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample @-@ example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ends the tor@@ ch of his team and said that she is only concentrated on their &quot; Contact &quot; in tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team is inten@@ tionally concerned as it feared that they were worried , by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that appeared repeatedly - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fighting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy told us on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but during the past six weeks we have made contact with tac@@ kles to a real main focus and that &apos;s the trend turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange , as this happens again and again at this time of season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and its ment@@ or reminds that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons who won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting your game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy told .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a she@@ ath @-@ dre@@ ck .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play , if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build up more confidence , because they are saying these things because they are a bit worried against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also proved that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher result when the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more experiments in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make a cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention , it means that we will meet again in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ bills to drug cl@@ ash
a man who possibly mis@@ ses a lifetime penalty because of its attempt to arrive in the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were mu@@ g@@ gled into Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men that were arrested the last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for trying to have a commercial lot of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café , from a harmless reason could have been .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the attitude of danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated to the court on Wednesday .
in case of the case , he lied to the police over his position .
together , Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to reach his release .
&quot; following reading the sworn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of these two persons , it is clear that the edition of a 200,000 dollar &apos;s security is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flanders .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , at the police , and at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 cur@@ few .

the girl woke up later , discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping dog .
she looked through it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ erts immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and looked the five pictures , and then analysed computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; concerned &quot; web research , the terms used for searching for in@@ consistent pictures of children .
H@@ og@@ g said that he did it to the officials , that he would lead to &quot; educ@@ t in the internet , &quot; and he said , &quot; a polic@@ eman , to be frigh@@ tened . &quot;
the Pro@@ secution E@@ ili@@ l Robertson told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a saying that he is addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he said that the searching for the computer were carried out of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten a ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the images and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to co@@ ax them .
he said he was sick in his head if he drinks , and said he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girls found the messages of the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and at the weeping .
it then looked the unnecessary pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants to con@@ front the def@@ endants .
the girl became interviewed and said that the def@@ endant received computers and play@@ station to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty on the meaning of the indictment , having stopped in@@ constant pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , and did not have appeared before the Court on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not to be found in the Register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one might argue that &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; in his absence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael dis@@ figured the verdict of October to obtain background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case by b@@ ail , but was kept at re@@ mand for the other time in the case of hear@@ ings .
he was still taken before the date of judgment to the list of sexual off@@ ender .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of the cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel &apos;s pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which was housed in a small cell .
because of violation of her human dignity , prisoners are fundament@@ ally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cell .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution on Wednesday .
those subject to the victim may even hope for money , if only a few days were imprisoned in confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe . he was housed in a sol@@ itary unit in Berlin Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square metres floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who was re@@ located on the lack of a fo@@ rested , had been re@@ located in a larger cell .
his term in force because of the un@@ fortun@@ ate detention conditions were held against the State of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the ruling of the Berlin Chamber &apos;s verdict and referred the case to re @-@ re @-@ trial .
they see human beings being hurt .
Chamber Supreme Court now op@@ ts for the amount of compensation
if for legal reasons of the query period , only a few days of detention to the compensation were relevant , it was a compensation of compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wi@@ ther to fear the legal gu@@ ardian of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Human Rights must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they first spoke in April of an in@@ mate damages because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell .
a def@@ endant from 2011 is also according to a decision from the 2011 cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed a Dec@@ ent @-@ Dec@@ ent accommodation in a parallel case issued by a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place every three months between 15 and 21 hours in one of the same cell as in Karls@@ bad .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were also hit the headlines in the last weeks .
prisoners are therefore kept shut down 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to sle@@ e@@ at@@ ry , it is said to have occurred due to the r@@ ins@@ ed situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young man , 19 will fall off 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany , according to the guidelines of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to the testimony of Vice President Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrates the effect of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany comes the following overview .
it applies according to different projections from 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in paid hire : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental business , and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments , even refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments would have to be planted annually and therefore the federal government would have to invest a level of 6.4 billion per year .
in fact , scientists and the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs are that there will also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Studies , 55 per cent of the poultry sector can be employed in Germany at the long term .
however , in Germany the refugees in Germany would not have been systematically investigated by their qualification , Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
working is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the Society of Society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , Germany has released a political shift : from the labor ban for refugees for recognition of labour .
while there was a labor ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dences , for asylum seek@@ ers .
in society - even because of the skilled workers - mainly the perspectives suggest that in order to allow refugees to be made faster in access to the labour market .
a large hur@@ dle to access to the labour market are missing German language skills .
so far , there is no exclusive offer to general and based language courses .
research also shows that jobs will be convey@@ ed most frequently through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg on Labour integration .
the Berlin school management has found that only few fle@@ dged parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ailed parents , it is only once important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ stri@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the Kit@@ a , the board is distributed in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators by the large number of refugees had to rise sharply , the Berlin Senate will try to increase their training capacity - by promoting more technical colleges .
students are prepared for tuition without German students in their classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , says Be@@ ate St@@ acks from Berlin &apos;s school management .
the German student works estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany would want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal Reserve granted asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ser@@ vi@@ ates the study - the only exception was to be Berlin , Wi@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but has given up his attitude .
study consent refugees could be facil@@ itated access to the university .
because refugees with a resident permit or Dul@@ ce received no more achievements after the asylum seek@@ ers Act anymore , when they start studying .
the latter doesn &apos;t get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ authorised persons .
thr@@ ong refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible to be B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 due to a short@@ age of 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , former Secretary of State for Science , and the German student body .
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will continue to play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of identity .
the state should gradually add the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
the foundation of a Islamic chari@@ ties were also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers profession@@ ally .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , representatives of Islam must unite to some and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to conce@@ de certain controls .
moreover , there is read@@ iness to take heed to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflict could also be registered to Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; in Germany , &quot; he said , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in order to change the majority of majority society , the breakdown of discrimination and rac@@ ism is under@@ going .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a decade of a decade , an anti@@ dis@@ krimin@@ ierungs@@ stelle is and a general act of equality .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NSU M@@ ord@@ Series showed , in the police and authorities systematically igno@@ res the rac@@ ist topic .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and advoc@@ acy groups in German have under@@ gone a long time and for what international agreements are compulsory for the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in the next few years if the country will remain peaceful and let us use its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is unable to provide medical care to the so far a@@ waited refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities , we create , &quot; he said the day &apos;s level .
however , extra money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery Heights , to all di@@ gesti@@ ble , is equal to the registration health card .
the services could later be calculated with the federal states .
and long term , it is highly question@@ able to submit so many people with the limited power catalog that the asylum seek@@ ers will see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise , doctors make doctors primarily to create language barriers .
so far so far , the Berlin &apos;s health scientist , The@@ a Bor@@ de , has proved to be harmful to other diseases than other patients .
interpre@@ ting will not only have to be accepted in medical clinics , and in medical practices , calls for them .
however , many refugees already have helped with more gener@@ alized medical operations in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
among refugee camps , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and the young people go to HIV En@@ lighten@@ ment .
some of the other forms of illness came to the German doctors from her training but clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
the paras@@ ite fall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as regards the doctors of doctors , even alle@@ vi@@ ation of refugees is even lost in sight .
Syrians have been a highly developed education system , some refugees and even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they would have to trace their quali@@ fications and un@@ condition@@ ally take ex@@ ams .
at least half of these refugees arrive in Germany ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) estimates that most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or in depression .
the B@@ Pt@@ K , the refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich revealed that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
anyone who suffers from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , suffers from other so @-@ called Flash@@ backs , with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart ha@@ v@@ ases , and dis@@ comfort .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong scre@@ ams and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms were chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have been given a therapy .
indeed , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a motion for psycho@@ therapy in the social affairs , but the processing lasts for several months .
moreover , in the social trial , non @-@ worker or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to errors , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst comes back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and a small entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst is in the bricks on the bricks and was@@ ps to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal trainer and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto the current man@@ oeu@@ vre stands .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift to am@@ aze is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take the people away from their daily routine and take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year old Jun@@ e@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rainbow cocktail with world city @-@ fl@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fl@@ air can now experience 50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer tour .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces by talented artists from all over the world .
excellent during the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with a joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to be up .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art in the Mast M@@ ust take cap@@ turing women &apos;s enemies in the storm .
besides numerous salmon fill@@ ets the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ sensitivity and joint .
bal@@ ancing with the unic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He yuan .
sn@@ apped and frigh@@ tening at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics how little different and intri@@ gu@@ ed with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephen &apos;s Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus are just a very often topic with different animal welfare organisations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes the stand : &quot; if not our animals are good , we are not doing well . &quot;
every mat@@ ure@@ ly , approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a mat@@ uring session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read off by the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with animals and have fun with them .
the animal doesn &apos;t feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the ring .
so the first commandment means : take care of the animals .
specially on her zeb@@ ily jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the family is proud of .
the two animals lived eight years in a palace , and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ ily is not ready for the ring , but it &apos;s the unique pet of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst will invite from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
furthermore , the daily pet is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false report in the European Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament also clou@@ ded by represent@@ ations of members of the opposition that they have received anonymous threat and warned them from Mr Mu@@ gabe with Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month they b@@ lown it out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese stated that seven opposition politician SMS messages received on their cell phones that they warned against Mr Mu@@ gab@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ us speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that termin@@ ates immun@@ ity in parliament , and as soon as they are leaving parliament , parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker , led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard introduces up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to be 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
hp will be split up later this year into two listed companies and the computer and printer business of its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP met in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person and Chief Executive Officer to the unit after the separation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is getting smaller and stronger than the HP today is , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing demands of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and is being focused on providing access to integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says an enterprise &apos;s explanation .
it is a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to create electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley &quot; birth@@ place of Silicon Valley .
hp has a massive restructuring process to handle the return from traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the belief that rather focused companies can produce a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and when his rehabilitation progres@@ ses into schedule , there is no reason why he could not play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario is already apparent that Wil@@ sh@@ ere won at least one of the next four games to England and in the face of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate jet@@ ty inf@@ rin@@ gement and then returned to its ancient swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is threatened not the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it &apos;s a bone , which doesn &apos;t heal well .
it is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his ank@@ le or with the injuries which he had previously .
this may be true from purely medi@@ cally view , but how Wen@@ ger is also recognized , there is the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
it also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 Lig@@ as@@ ars in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries ratio during the last season will take over .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a long period of time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body will stabili@@ ze , I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League @-@ Season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on coming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger will introduce a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ ino must be started .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the courts with the greatest in@@ ti@@ mid effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season was started .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , based on the Richter scale 3@@ 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has moved the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , left with his management , driven by his management to lead the association to his first European triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never worked out for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship festival : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar ren@@ der@@ ings in shows is apparent , especially in view of how the need for men to open , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , how su@@ ici@@ dal rates of young men prove on a 15 @-@ year lifting .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in effort to address the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ings ( CA@@ LM - Campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) announced the year of the man to question the culture of the question that men seek to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of fighting in order to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms suggested that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; its chances were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellectu@@ ally healthy friends determine the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can function .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important to the immediate effect than a significant contact .
our digital life have the need to be strong , viable , and successful to appear , even if the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists determine ; money , image , social status , everything at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that works on our spiritual health much deeper .
and , as a vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty for friends was that this focus was put on my head .
every character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality that sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler stran@@ gling hu@@ gs , moments in football looks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross about Rachel - all this came out from knowing that men should look forward to each case even though they get back often to explore fully their feelings .
as a member of the phone examination revealed to me : &quot; my squ@@ ir@@ er role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ cri@@ tically endangered , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
the old saying &quot; I get too righ@@ tly &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind when I try to provide long @-@ term pat@@ ern@@ ity mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s kind@@ nesses .
so very my objective State status on the phone to help people in eye view of despair may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Peru .
or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be broadcast on Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets the help of PS@@ G , Malmö to rest
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his match against Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps the PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edin@@ son Cav@@ ani came out course when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who brought the French Master on the way , but thereafter it missed a number of occasions before they finally increased its head when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute .
in Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A takes Paris a strong start to the Swedish masters , as they don &apos;t only stri@@ ve for the quali@@ fications for the K.@@ O@@ TS rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics missed opportunities before the gate . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his k@@ ens career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to look back our opponents , even if there are certain things , which we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; that &apos;s a good pre@@ fix .
we wanted to win and win , although I regret that we did not have scored two other goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was held at the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was kicked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean flu@@ gel@@ man was referred to as the man to take over PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he interpreted to Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass in behind the Malmö defense , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and ended in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off , started to reach this stage , joined the An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man @-@ defence and two deep in the central field ble@@ w a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who walked far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some errors and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not only patented in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he had a lot more cre@@ aming when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria was turned to a shooting down , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours trademark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans scored his sixth win , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , was able to keep the end result low before the spare @-@ player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a goal at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later gave to the fact that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not equal the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
watch out of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film .
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ bin filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown as a discussion about the diversity and said she will not need behind the scenes .
as a result of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown appeared , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do so with the movie &apos;s occupation , and not with the score of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted shocked , with en@@ vi@@ ed dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when commenting on the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the lau@@ re@@ ate Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to think people to think about it - whoever will be always the director , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the figure of Harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown first said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People seated for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their scrip@@ ture , &quot; at the end , could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval about Dam@@ ons Respon@@ ses .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni put his anger over the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - this is SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et has earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release .
Dam@@ ons Respon@@ ses are at a point where the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media stands at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Movement created a nation @-@ wide effect and forced law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ ating practices against fer@@ ral ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in February , the singer Prince released a record on movement during the launch of the nominated records of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Movement has published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality in Hass@@ el@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ ch group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .

&apos;@@ American Ninja war@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports weather and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who won the American Ninja war@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which finished just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could close all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the finals .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climb rope was on the last task in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten finished the task within the time he finished the first ath@@ let , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of the American Ninja war@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still in shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or was going to live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
chief producer K@@ ent We@@ ed replaced himself with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he finished the first course at all , did not get any prize money .
after the rules , money is the quick@@ est person .
&quot; when there are more than one fin@@ alists , they get the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great degree of gra@@ ti@@ fications .
I don &apos;t think he got a res@@ ent@@ ll about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is just so happy to have done what he has done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from fans he received lots of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same , when they had joined the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to a low season , the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ cks on Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ ER@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball and today &apos;s Tig@@ ers are located on the last place in the American League Central .
the ti@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but this part was perfect on Tuesday - Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb up in a pitch of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word which was hard to gras@@ p over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said tiger &apos;s manager Brad U@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit raised three times in the first two ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck three times in the 1 / 3 inside and made it possible for three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful launch in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year heavily , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will completely concentrate entirely in the game .
the newly designated Tiger &quot; Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he made the whi@@ ch@@ stick quite well , &quot; said Pri@@ mus .
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , clearly looked better off in the bull@@ pen and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh week , T@@ wins lost their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ xton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed through the wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted with him from the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie , Miguel S@@ ano , which was designed for two @-@ run two @-@ handed press h@@ agen .
with a couple of pe@@ asant and the finishing @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ge to a double Play .
it was the major league leading the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had a double Play !
after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings a Insurance @-@ Run , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano is out of three pitch for its fifth ton .
in Detroit , Detroit prof@@ ited the title of the game by a still not moving Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three install@@ ers in the first two ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game by the vulner@@ ability after he had ste@@ amed more than a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt glad when I left and felt that I would make some good pitch there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ PS gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
the Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; to the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right wing , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get to the third place which finished the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid the second one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not been well beaten , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes found himself in a pitch @-@ count that was replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter with the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ handed over in the third inning .
at Hughes , there was three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four cords .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sán@@ chez was left due to an injury of the throw @-@ out .
it is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who underwent the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability for a shoulder blade , should be activated for the starting on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is canc@@ eled by the case of po@@ aching in order to win the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , which has been acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he ste@@ als her through on 20 August due to a fall in the right hip .

Isch@@ ia : German military attack in Syria an option
Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , head of the Munich Security Conference , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , thinking about military action plans do not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective covering . &quot;
four years ago I was glad that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict in front of our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Deutschland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

regarding the question of an agreement to which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that there have already been an agreement between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
these figures were not mentioned and rejected discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .

their aim is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit with several other EU leaders for the next week .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have not yet posed a joint action in the crisis so far .
the EU interior ministers want to take a new return to the non @-@ binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee movement in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support countries in the first recording and distribution of men .
at the end of Tuesday , the Con@@ federation will hold its public consultation on almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin in Berlin on Tuesday night .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , be@@ cometh this also .
but who did not have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany .
this view was directly expressed in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole , ought to overcome a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
meanwhile thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are stuck on the route route .

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to his sl@@ ender , it is often de@@ pl@@ aten .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are the same : there are B vitamins such as B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. From above all , man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and the prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ otene .
who eats the fruits , thus supports tend@@ on , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
while purchasing , man@@ gos should not be soft , or rather heavy and pleasant smell .
the form@@ work colour alone tells nothing about how ripe fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste very tasty .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within less days .
then they taste pure , or in sweet foods .

Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es have often been able to live for centuries as a minority .
the place is symbo@@ lically visible in a symbolic way that tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held up a young August@@ ine mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a perfect sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions were probably encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later battle against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther continued ste@@ amed over the split into the western Church .
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the haupt@@ werke that has painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who puts his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ ves .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and fan@@ ciful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : appropriate the respective subjects , that can quite easily work .
around the last three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many them@@ atic areas of &quot; book of all books . &quot;
records were created , topics like crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
so he intri@@ gues many partners spontane@@ ously : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing company with its focus on art books .
and , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who separated himself on the basis of painting with the respective bi@@ ble points .
he interpreted the interpre@@ ts from the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible and so in today &apos;s &quot; translated into current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded in the original Bible Study of Martin Luther and each of the artist &apos;s original Bible prophecy , which form@@ ulates here his personal thoughts on their respective situation .
the jewellery collar has golden spoon .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal a double insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant rulers .
&quot; that was the education at the pipe , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to comp@@ ose this to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ lie@@ ve art in the quick@@ est time again : &quot; perception of imag@@ ery is influenced today and that &apos;s loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images have a mysterious and mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they seem to have a effect on them , discover and sense that power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art . &quot; I like what he can compreh@@ end with his picture . &quot;
old didn &apos;t seem to understand the Bible completely , but most important for him , even mysterious topics .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text clearly explained . &quot; created a pictures of the Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ hler for both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen nails - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition presenting from the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
construction start for BM@@ X track
plans made , space found , companies engaged for a circuit in a circuit : one year later , almost everything is ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was over again .
failure in politics and administration provided for waste , especially with those who would not have toler@@ ated the railway .
looking down hill , place new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
permission should go out in October , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ah @-@ Bock , who now had been the first child for child and youth committees in the middle of October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there should be no &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the major league a major sign in the weekend .
football is re@@ acting on the picturesque location in Germany and secured the policy to help protect the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think that &apos;s the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody &apos;s interested in getting this topic into the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively .
&quot; I am the minister of law next Wednesday and meet the State Minister , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
however , the decisive turn@@ out must constitute the policy .
for this reason , the German football federation has therefore increased its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; regarding the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also , some federal states support this program .
this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ts will set a clear sign if it takes place on the left hand cot instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Hermes ) to help with &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Police Head of Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , called the project as &quot; thorou@@ gh@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every day , no one can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ states , no , we need to use our jet force , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already so incredibly interesting to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ er@@ r managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent characters in the league . &quot;
to this Friday , the national team of the women in Halle / Sa@@ ale invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large common Union of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects would be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government each represents 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach .
reports : SAP board head lost an eye in case of accident
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye for several reports , according to a fall in early July .
after the accident on a stair@@ case in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped to a water glass after midnight , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost em@@ bloo@@ dless , she was getting out tow@@ ed into the street - that he told us so the last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Plat@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t would go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of oc@@ tober , we meet with the supervisory board meeting at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year @-@ old manager was involved in the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , will come back to Germany again in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you &apos;ve enjoyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes raised to a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s in the first group of matches in the European League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football @-@ Bundesliga in Du@@ el by the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 PM / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot take him back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga @-@ top@@ ical game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach opened : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in light of its high strain of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ or position on the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he quit his move to the door@@ ke@@ epers .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller accepts the space of the regular b@@ art@@ ender Roman office .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher engaged the world champion .
whether past@@ ure f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europe @-@ League play , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open .
at high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ bear@@ ded statement of fellow player R@@ EU@@ s that the final statement for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as well : &quot; he is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot;
robots : government wants to leadership for Germany
following the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be the change of technological pioneers .
on Wednesday , the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided to create a strategy paper from the home of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , will see investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ at International Motor Show by a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
automated , connected driving will increase road security and ensure less st@@ out , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he will also discuss the topic with his counterpart , the G7 states that came together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show .
the German Ministry of Strategic Affairs , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a generous support of digital radio teleph@@ ony .
the testing of new technology is currently being tested on motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to be around international that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver so far .
during automated driving , the car takes over , and the driver , the driver will be more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that detect the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , passenger vehicles on public roads have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving capabilities on the German site will estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD candidate S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly explained .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still skep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
a result of the 1998 survey of the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned on Wednesday that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will move through the next ten years , and 32 percent will only believe that 31 percent believe it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed are expected to go by 2025 with an autonomous driving force , which is 33 percent in the US .
already in Germany , drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital segment , only seven percent could agree to complete control throughout all roads across the roads .
for the flowing traffic , no less than 15 percent could present at the motorway , a 45 percent share .
well , every person would leave control under no circumstances .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo made the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ teaching in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of a big fashion show and a wa@@ ist @-@ qu@@ oise @-@ qu@@ int@@ et : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying thanks to video projections .
they carry out the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others influenced by Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with that he was a skir@@ ts in the skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; in former times it was ble@@ ached , and now it &apos;s real , &quot; said G@@ aul .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is an luck that the fashion designers has changed his first position to a look over his person .
actually , he would have been against it because : &quot; for me , a bit for me was a bit of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you arrive at the museum .
the stunning collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly an out@@ dated plant of man , written in fashion history without ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically the show wasn &apos;t rebuilt , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , which was used for much effort : to do pupp@@ ets , for example a styl@@ ist was involved .
on 14 tons of material , the makers have cor@@ ted according to the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .

Heidi meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are lou@@ der than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gaul@@ tier .
the Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tender , o@@ dic Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
playing with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he was inspired by fashion , later he taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , including Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later on I bought them , of course .
for his first own show , he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but could have kept the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - precious tip as fashion @-@ niche
in earlier , it was about the long embroi@@ dery in and around pl@@ ank about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and sp@@ ik@@ es were developed in large quantities for customers , for example bl@@ ank@@ ets and gar@@ ages .
today , this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ist@@ erous Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is again important .
in the initial times of pl@@ au@@ sp@@ ire , fashion played a larger part , then pushed through the textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as an niche .
Rein@@ hardt means some examples : top in jewelry , accessories like bags and with regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on past stit@@ ches , is an increasing volume potential .
who has no niche in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
we do already have half of all orders for us .
( with nine other companies ) , Mo@@ ist@@ erous Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association with platinum and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales are broken .
private specialty stores and also the wholesale market there is almost no more .
customers hardly reach our products in this path .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
moreover , weak@@ est the export , currently in Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score points as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ broi@@ der@@ le in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we lead a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger exterior of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
it develops a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which have to re@@ consider mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , a existing design often varies only slightly , to keep a customer base .
a few years ago the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rebuilt the historic snow @-@ pointed tip .
in this way , the machine attracts attention at some places .
the platinum champ@@ ions of Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se had inspired him : &quot; before that I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ zer . &quot;
now they use the screw top for their jewellery .
in an elabor@@ ate article she shaped the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of pl@@ au@@ sp@@ ire - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it is also available in the United States , Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and want to feel a con@@ mem@@ or@@ tive piece .
that I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ sp@@ ire .
Disney also plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not a new film adaptation , but for a sort of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl .
this is about experience of N@@ anny with the family res@@ ets in the times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI is pushing forward to unlock the economy broad@@ ly for the world
the economy has to open its wider out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was t@@ asked with steering the reform .
&quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business reasons , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the centr@@ alized guide group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will cause new vibration and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ i said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership team has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , support public offices ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population system .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , the sectors and companies identified that investment is not involved in question .
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
the initiative is of importance , as it indicates the market a larger role in the allocation of resources , a state @-@ of @-@ government business environment and open the market open , said the statement .
the government is also lo@@ osen up controls on the businesses that are transmitted to the company and make sure they decide to run business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , public controlled sectors open , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the lawful interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners , a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card , &quot; to request the requirements optim@@ ised and the application process will be facil@@ itated .
the law of lawyers to guarantee to practice their activity , and using professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also took part by Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides , such as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ level in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a significantly higher dose of the thri@@ ll .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding user paper for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans in sharp : &quot; risks and side effects missed the lack of industrial and environmental policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is supposed to have the limits of a nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or ter@@ med fish from &quot; green economic reasons &quot; to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly polluted with mercury today , that , based on the still existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the sounds are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ mistak@@ able .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to reduce the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch also mentioned this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually den@@ ds so low , that they already keep the planned maximum values already today .
the decrease in cl@@ auses is therefore &quot; a persistent de@@ fle@@ ction principle , that helps business alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal , which is particularly sensitive to the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
