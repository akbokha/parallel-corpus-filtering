Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not straight @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as the dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the encounter should also be the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been spann@@ ed for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the constant sett@@ ler in Israel and poses a lack of approval in the peace process .
by Obama the deal struck the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress was denied by Barack Obama .
the speech wasn &apos;t spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel .
in a call @-@ up professor , professor who shot his friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told a slightly angry voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to empha@@ size that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house the officials found Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could do it backward , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that , in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , set up already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police according to the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that the university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb had taken the cat@@ astrop@@ hic emergency call sometime later .
until the end of the day there was another death : he took the life when the police settled him .
a day after shooting in the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind sealed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what was motivated .
the details published by issu@@ ers at the two ends of the state published details , as well what students and staff who knew him would have helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students told that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said that he did not have any history of violence or criminal justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned a book written in a written book in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sub@@ merged in the Department of Social Sciences and History , which includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some til@@ t to problem@@ atic at@@ titudes .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes said that he told him that he had told him at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has got any health problem .
this year he only set two online courses .
the latest changes in employment policy of the University revealed that the promotion , for the lamb had worked so hard for him to represent no warranty for an automatic journey to a position as Assistant Professor .
University @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions not to answer the Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , police found the police later Lam@@ bs track , when he entered Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again .
before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran even in the entrance .
it wasn &apos;t clear why the lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , the university began its work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in ped@@ agog@@ y in spring .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when they met by joint friends .
they and their friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy , who tried several years to teach her the guitar .
he was the women &apos;s warm at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls are f@@ ren@@ ched when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said she had divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail took part in the summer of three years ago .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he had completed the lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night at night 5 September after the lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ ate audience .
there was no signs that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the rooms and were jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for joke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized on American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas so was President of his Brotherhood and the Student &apos;s Committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle of candle .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the M@@ ahn@@ wake , while the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect the police now says that he had shot the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that he said in his emergency call P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox : &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater at the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me and it will gradually become clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated g@@ aps and an arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date .

UN CEO says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the nearly five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will spar@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN Group calls again all the parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and supporting integ@@ rative negotiations to finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign minister of the five standing member countries of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Assembly &apos;s Ministers meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ ts that the insur@@ rec@@ tions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in establishing the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated to achieve a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 re@@ frac@@ tional values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand@@ new him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edges at p@@ olls down , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate .
it is , of course , too early in the electoral period .
nobody asser@@ ts that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republican nom@@ ination .
experts , that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was assigned to the asc@@ ending Herman Cain , none of which won only a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but external sides like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to flow their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ umps popular have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
the Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa released last week that 60 percent of re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CNN pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; when he was the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over tr@@ ump ) .
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favourite establishment of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees Tr@@ uman temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the US Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a pre@@ sidents , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the state of State of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of re@@ public@@ ans think he had the personality of a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that it is not the personality , to effectively run office , and almost six of 10 causes that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republican voters get used to the idea .
when they set their v@@ aun@@ ching bag , Republican voters keep tr@@ ump for real .
if asked , who is the most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , say CNN / OR@@ C from the past week , four out of ten that tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the date when four of the ten end of July will put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Republican women thought that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination , just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is obvious that a variety of GO@@ P voters will watch a m@@ umps campaign than plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans collect a different candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes almost every one .
some experts refer to it that the spl@@ ashing field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ us .
but a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , tr@@ ump and majority support harvested .
he before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the Rand Paul , John Ka@@ ach and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who kills him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a short majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they made their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump will say that they have been awarded their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 per cent said they were open the door to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump emerged in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; was immigration and fishing point in the public dis@@ course for 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic exclusion of j@@ ump of His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and the re@@ orient@@ ated efforts will be damaged .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with the questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do so too .
the fru@@ stration concerning the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , half of the support of Republican voters will now fall by their out@@ si@@ der status .
six of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mont@@ es@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in the Congress , 54 per cent of &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
the road costs an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it means the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special layers are one square meter the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Company Angel@@ s &amp; Nations has published a ranking of most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ er@@ ings in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is located here as an exception as not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double tor@@ ques in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky sign by Thomas Müller made the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 near Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the witch chair of Pi@@ raeus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Divine matches ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th strong first step in series aims to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take home the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
he received his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ leadership of the people &apos;s help by the Olympic champion , Roberto , who put a shot at the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had promised Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m in front of the game in Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium prior to 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated not@@ ion , without shiny .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Königs@@ berg , including anti @-@ emin@@ ent clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund also stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams were un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victims .
they went brave to work with their offensive efforts but often too sin@@ less .
the attacks were led too often by playing outside Douglas Costa , which was seldom used against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more fortun@@ ate than his flan@@ k from the right sem@@ it@@ field in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion made the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the kne@@ e ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although the Bavaria moved to the domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ raeus was able to set its needle .
but on the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New , he was promising .
as he gave a shot from Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a Vier@@ erk@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ des , first sat outside .
the World Cup was only given after the final training green light , Matthias Sam@@ mer said at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something different from it , that &apos;s already v@@ icious . &quot;
even at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the de@@ jected Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller made one better .
prior to the game , T@@ ie joined us all over the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ med Bayern fans in their viewers @-@ blo@@ c apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pir@@ ates with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went out to the Munich followers .
at least a Bavaria @-@ fan was transported from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
whoever smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this is laying on a vintage @-@ long study .
the good news : when deci@@ du@@ ly decreases the risk .
smokers should have a mark@@ edly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this study goes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking , the risk of losing their teeth is higher , around 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ feet higher .
scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of dental out@@ age are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking was a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the relationship between smoking and dental loss go back to frequent tooth@@ joints in smokers .
in what extent , smoking also increases the risk of cavi@@ ties .
people who have heard with smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could last for ten years until the endanger@@ ing went back to the level of non @-@ smoking , the first au@@ gate Thomas Dietrich about the English University Birmingham .
people had to convince people to be non @-@ smoking , the head of the H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E stated : &quot; smoking al@@ oud the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and leads to good dental health to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of denti@@ tion , DI@@ f@@ E was divided .
previous studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early dental out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study covers the findings .

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
for the sharp@@ ening of the war on the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial public transportation facilities for disp@@ utes between groups and states are to be replaced by a transparent system , which is clearly evident in its functionality more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust the citizen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the EU @-@ Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ din proposed the proposal for the European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced its support .
TTIP should be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration Proce@@ edings are predic@@ table that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
it is planned for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to rise against jud@@ gements .
so far , the process involved among themselves agreed on a arbit@@ rator , and there was no agreement against their jud@@ gements .
in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in Fair@@ ness and Justice , commented on Malm@@ ström .
in the long term , it wants to pursue its own data to an International Investment Court .
they could then be clari@@ fied in disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) mainly requested by major concerts ( IS@@ DS ) as one of the major reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional refer@@ r@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ty , by the company of damages , the tax@@ pay@@ ers deposits , national laws or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as camp@@ act had the proposals of the EU Commission as in@@ adequate .
in particular , it was critici@@ zed that it should not be applied for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as a great progress .
in the spring , the Commission included essential points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
in 2004 , the European company business association campaig@@ ned to limit the key opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , the name was called .
when talks are concluded on the TTIP agreement ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it continued un@@ clear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investment protection has not been discussed with the United States so far .
originally a context for the agreement is already at the end of this year .
this term is regarded as no longer viable .

the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells about various places that he always records on the map and report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and z@@ art arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens proves himself as a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart songs that harmon@@ ises very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time in the great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ather@@ proof series : each of the 50 US states must be discussed .
but already in 2004 and near the near of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has been published and breaks positively to meet some expectations .
Stev@@ ens stand down here .
live fulfilling his guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musicians who live in New York will be returning to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chicago &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens inv@@ it@@ ent You To : come on Fe@@ el The P@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ look of ideas and style fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no list of the most influential music media in any season list .
after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but by programmed sequences or beats , plays with all the effect and Hall .
long ago , the stage shows have long gone out , stage shows are used here for brigh@@ tly colored spectacle from ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stages .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band by Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Theater presents mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although there are nearly 2,000 guests sitting in their chairs , the well @-@ known Stev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without creating a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play through the wide @-@ enriched album .
from the audience , one hear : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you could throw the &quot; sla@@ b in principle . &quot;
only adding to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens feels modest , plays a few older songs and eventually gra@@ bs under the Tuscan applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ en debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly a@@ waited since its election .
the new president Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n was to put his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s Prize and became David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to check out the first of its six given questions shortly after lunch , with its performance was likely to be insp@@ ected by the media and the Labour MPs .
he called &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes to his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked the criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands in the focus of several fron@@ ts stories @-@ stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention .
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , talked in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got the Labour leader to sing the National An@@ them , regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leading team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader .
the political correspondence of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ ack@@ ened within Labour &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns utter@@ ances on the position of the European Union and the limit .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to make Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions , said that the party is &quot; very clear , &quot; that they were only against government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , ever since he is a T@@ ory leader , over the past decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised to another political approach , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions concerning Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the former Prime Minister has to con@@ front the Prime Minister , and that he is under@@ going for &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the stre@@ ches with with@@ ers , and instead carried out to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , is represented when he does not participate , for example , when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally seize the Word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ ber , the spokes@@ man of the house , asked to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since they first was broadcast on television in 1990 , the Minister of Labour was considered the main Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the sub @-@ house and its position under his par@@ liam@@ ents , although critics have argued that they have become a caric@@ ature and require expan@@ sive reforms .

Po@@ unds increased by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound climbed up immediately after data , which indicate an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was enhanced by the building objective SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and produced ass@@ essments on the time of a interest auction since 2009 .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
one transaction would combine two of the world &apos;s biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands such as Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods at Ri@@ chem@@ ont was 0.9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s newest figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again increases growth .
shares of Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining company told that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , namely a 4.3 % drop after Gold@@ man Sachs had his assessment for the company rating . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports held firm had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages are dangerous .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that these merchants would like to compens@@ ate the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the level movement , Al@@ hay potato has put together meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Met@@ cash starts soil fertility campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - accident
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores in front of an Al@@ di summit in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ resistant campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are ready for their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via the social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
IG@@ A dealers and suppliers leap on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores , and shop owner , the con@@ signed tickets for the South Australian soccer league for loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will run for food , alcohol and devices to meet its annual investors strategy .
it is much on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern States .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern nations .
yet , analysts as Morgan Stanley observed that Al@@ di will take a five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
according to a report published in this week , analyst Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley is estimated that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million annual sales per year and in cash for $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ cash approximately $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful one .
Morgan Stanley is participating in the food and market share of 3,8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is probably going to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to react to Mr Dou@@ glass comments publicly .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ As market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food trade , which has approximately 1,200 K@@ A retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operating debt reduction on profit@@ ability and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers restra@@ ined and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ , to increase selling prices with col@@ es and wo@@ ol@@ ar to hundreds of products each week with improving fresh foods and deliver a better choice of private @-@ label food .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the wholesale store and store re@@ mun@@ itions to Elan will be expected and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to profit in the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise to criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ ally damages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the shorter storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ ro and deserves praise to the President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly rather praise his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is referred to as a Special KS &quot; became the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gy@@ ro with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the refer@@ ees , whereas Harrison proclaimed : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he broke a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp won a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I feel rather drow@@ sin@@ ess , is the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi was stri@@ pped a little bit into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a tie in the US Open , but he is not the first player to break a bat with itself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too aust@@ ere .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is a very strong and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account the best decision on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right to all but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all around the controversy sur@@ round &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has managed to make the rise , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he goes into the eyes of the public , but we try to support him , we try to keep the consequences of his action . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I think for appropriate , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and war broke down the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the parties who tried to stop illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed in the border , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian civil servants re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled from violence before had fled for an unknown period in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents , and settled there .
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter above them , the Mig@@ rants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the Border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from protest foods and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would come back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be held in the coming days conversations with Brussels and other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40.000 people who sought to take refuge in the invaded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would mean that the EU countries would take up more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary won &apos;t put his hopes on a bad action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions existed on Tuesday . authorities were able to speed up more satisfaction to the crisis , so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ a said that his country is also the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania , to stop the stream of migrants by the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata told that even prison quarters were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic government policy are seeking a better life , and not war @-@ wing , which are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , to build the government along the southern border to Serbia with a crime . these laws also place higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for the traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government declares the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said S &amp; D spokesperson for Kov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must not agree on the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have been seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser for Or@@ ban said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed by criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are moving fast to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a mig@@ rating car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos led the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and sting a crowd in order to avoid it .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead in a national pol@@ l before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to win a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the previous elections ( 58 per cent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who still does not declare if he is can@@ di@@ zed for the presidential office , support 15 percent of the elections for the elections .
more than five months before the start of the preliminary election , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are represented in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton holds a big head with women and moder@@ ates , but they have reduced the origins .
their support for men is clearly decl@@ ining , and S@@ anders are just returned with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit of democratic elec@@ tors under 50 years has contrac@@ ted , and they are and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton had a big head start with the older voters .
in the last month , Clinton had two double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ torate in the nationwide predi@@ ct nationwide that they would support the Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reserved and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly impressed by her .
the views are stronger than those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that Clinton can support him with enthusiasm , the Republican voters say more than its top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the most common answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and the voters are also cited .
as the vice president acc@@ uses an potential for the presidential office in the Wa@@ ag@@ ulation , 57 percent of the democratic voters want him to see him in the race - even though one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked in general election who would be their second choice for party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be far ahead of his second choice .
bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ ct for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead increased ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic elec@@ torate believe Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has decreased from 78 percent over the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that be@@ ating it as the &quot; sel@@ ections , &quot; has risen .
however , by the question of what is more important in one candidates , Democratic voters call questions about the ability .
similarly , as in the last month , no single democra@@ t candidate or potential candidate for these voters emphas@@ ised as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results with some important features in elec@@ tors of their party &apos;s sel@@ ections .
multi@@ ples consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong guide qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts through the three Can@@ did@@ ates best at hon@@ esty , whereas Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty @-@ percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton &apos;s honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters of the general elections in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ torate has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and an server during the term as Secretary of State , most of the Democratic voters were satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public .
half of the Americans are now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the issue came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her still deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views are worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trusted by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote have not enough for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of voting rights also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump received good notes on leadership .
of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush goes best in hon@@ esty .
a majority looks like sin@@ c@@ ere rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the previous year is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a nationwide survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located near Donald Tr@@ ump on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
meanwhile , half of the elec@@ torate in the new survey , half of the elec@@ tors in the new survey , and others lose weight .
Republican voters continues to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debates last month , at 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives at demo@@ graphic groups well and ski@@ p@@ umping under Republican voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ himself , is beaten with Wiscon@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is at the deepest of the lowest month , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are on third place with 6 % .
the error margin on the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son is going to p@@ olls - he is at 19 % support with the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
at a glance at one in the last week , Tr@@ ump found a number of side@@ ways for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for him to ask Com@@ m@@ umps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant pool temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough to present hot water .
a bathroom in North or Baltic sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
man@@ ners will not go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
however , bath temperatures continue to reach the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ comer
almost two years after a student at a schi@@ kan@@ ous ritual as a student group in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , passed away , murder are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ bro@@ therhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an execution ritual as in September 2013 , and delayed their transport into the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police par@@ ted .
officials said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound bag full of sand , and had repeatedly been attacked , while he was trying to go through a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully prepared and were waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to get his symptoms of goo@@ dies and Andy Men@@ g , to get the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police master Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the Brotherhood began to hide and introduced the welfare of the Brotherhood , in principle , gover@@ ned by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; he said .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been repeated with bl@@ unt force , injury of head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury found a charge for the first five members of the Monroe County for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with a criminal attack and formation of a criminal organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization that has - officially or un@@ official - this is sanc@@ tioned , so we will also put them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and national bro@@ therhood re@@ vo@@ ke their belonging to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
a interest rate is coming , and the house@@ se gets into the wan@@ der , ten@@ dering to bonds , and the economy will lead into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long will it take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve during raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in doing the economy and financial investments react .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank has so viol@@ ently empha@@ sized that investors should not concentrate on what it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period which is needed for the norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could however determine that the entire excitement was probably exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is un@@ avoid@@ able of some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money . &quot; Julian J@@ ess@@ op , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , said in a message to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of the US interest to normal ups , but still on low level to strike the seis@@ mic shock which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest amounts of interest is for a while vol@@ atile .
once the increase meets , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to ins@@ ulated return orders from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts at a newer study on what happens after interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly been upward trend in the past 35 years - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest income , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 14.@@ 4 percent ) , then back to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , where Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ ds later occur in the concentration cycle , and the yield began to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but Zin@@ als fo@@ es them often .
in the current case the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions that could not exist before and accelerate the recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in a place of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate rose by just below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect that this will last and expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
interest rate increases with such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cast the question on whether it is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants have made the whole year on a interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may have an increase in this meeting , Fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study , all increases cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in the GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing process very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a clear recovery from what the worst recession in the observ@@ ational phase was .
the current cycle is far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the solid income was also vol@@ atile , because the market takes a interest rate hike , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic circuit .
in bonds , returns the direction as soon as the first increase in lowering in the cycle .
at the end of the increased cycle , the loan rel@@ ates immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates may result that ren@@ dering between longer and shorter bonds will merge and lead to a desc@@ ending of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ ses in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the power of the dollar and the drop of inflation expectations there are some evidence that the market adapted to the prosp@@ ect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest have risen , the shooting down is fl@@ atter , bor@@ rowing have increased , and the vol@@ atility have increased - all the market characteristics when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ened its strategy .
in the great and all , companies that roll the larger part of their business activity in the US will benefit if interest rates are climbing and local products more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will be worse since a top dollar increases their products on the global market and as well as financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positive for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet with a strong balance sheet after each of the interest income increased by 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside of the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from increasing dollars .
savings could see gains by higher yields , even if experts in different opinion , how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the Tran@@ sm@@ itter because of his &quot; stup@@ id@@ ation &quot;
he argued that he is not being able to differenti@@ ate from commercial rival .
he also consul@@ ted the BBC Music Awards , telling that she was just The Br@@ its im@@ itated .
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins took hold of the Voice of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leader of the parliamentary committee and increased new pressure on the transmitter , to prove that he does not do what the private station does not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the con@@ doms of the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public state @-@ legal radio station is &quot; verd@@ ant &quot; and increasingly to be distinguished from its commercial competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ev@@ o@@ bedient &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also consul@@ ted the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be just under any other name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you are actually im@@ itated on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far off its commercial opponent , when it is about live music and enlighten@@ ment of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the new works of Radio 3 to find new music and work for new works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work to engage with the audience as it did so in the past , because the British inform@@ s less of classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media , and sport that fell under fire , into the commercial rival to the feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins took hold of The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our house @-@ house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it star@@ es the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or give money to the commission works for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
online sales rein@@ forces three years ago by using cell phones to store
experts believe that the Black Friday will change issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets are turned into violin cities .
however , experts predi@@ ct that there are now evidence that the online sales are stagn@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts predi@@ ct that there are evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate , when new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he declared that the online sales were reinforced three years ago , when buyers were employed to work with their cell phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this one comm@@ utes itself , and we may possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining revenues .
experts believe that buyers will take their purchases before this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , the average number of buyers about their computers in order to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers sites are stor@@ med .
experts believe that Black Friday in which the buyer should stri@@ ve for bar@@ gains for bar@@ gain , purch@@ aser could make purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending has been issued for something more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now conducted via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the killed in Mecca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried out by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mecca by roads
Saudi Arabia establishes the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that altogether 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed
hundreds of Muslims were assembled , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets , to bury them that were killed , when a crane collapsed on Mek@@ kas @-@ Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
full @-@ filled , mostly dressed in white , the distance to acc@@ use their respect , when the first of the dead came up their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z cemetery .
the memorial @-@ pro@@ c@@ ession passed away in the Holy place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed collapsed .
the bodies were released for funeral , when Saudi @-@ king over the construction company of the bin Laden thanks to the catastrophe , which left also 3@@ 94 injured , has imposed a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 sailors that were killed , as a crane collapsed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ ong , were carried by the streets .
among the dead lived Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mecca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today , King Sal@@ man , who joined the bin Laden , should not stand the arm of the crane , as he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree which was published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency of the news agency did not discuss this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership abroad must be forbidden .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man was trying to reveal what the fall of the crane collapsed , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch took place later this month .
the bin Laden group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also refers to the group because of non @-@ current security measures , and because it does not co @-@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes sur@@ round Mek@@ kas @-@ Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is managed by Bin Laden &apos;s bin Laden .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the Saudi family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a dis@@ cour@@ ier son who was born from the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy body .
civil servants said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
representatives of affili@@ ates that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the relatives of the killed are and the same sum of permanently injured .
other verses get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap eastern European cra@@ ft@@ men is over
British employ increasingly handi@@ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified craftsmen in Eastern Europe has a rise behind
this leads to the fact that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at ar@@ tis@@ ans , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will close nationwide
by Ru@@ pert Steiner , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is asser@@ ted that Britain con@@ serve her h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen that carry out work in their home .
if you were sent to handle a hammer or a brush to stretch walls , you belong to a minority today .
because Britain are becoming increasingly handi@@ craftsmen to perform home jobs in their houses , so the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ selling chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services to civil prices is now out@@ dated .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shop is planning to set up craftsmen and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to set up growing demo@@ graphic trends that feature more female single @-@ households that are more popular than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger towards a balance .
generally , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in decision @-@ making .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who listed one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also embra@@ ced their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company which is exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - Di@@ versity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the group training costs for closing of shops .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from a@@ ich / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Federal Constitutional Court of Kl@@ agen@@ furt , on Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball player , I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ren@@ unci@@ ation .
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with authority .
he was acquitted of this alleg@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , it was cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants had disp@@ oss@@ essed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts held in their functions , for private purposes .
the amount increases with around 400,000 Euros .
the Sport@@ func@@ tionary are also charged with financial terms .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ lav@@ ate judge , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence appe@@ aled that there was no asset to the association at any time .
only allow@@ ances were counted and the sport club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and invested a lot of time and money from the liabilities - the liabilities were approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; then we stood in front of the situation : do we carry the club further or to lock up ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in the breaking of the excitement of the financial am@@ ts .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money , put our health insur@@ ances as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the installation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be agreed with the club : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts to be made .
furthermore , in case of such financial success the allow@@ ance of allow@@ ance payments had been decre@@ asing until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allow@@ ance damage was only years later , namely , from the year 2003 , when an increase had been paid to the account .
therefore , flat @-@ flat and non @-@ detailed bookings seemed to be observed .
the two accused conducted the accounts and spar@@ books jointly administered together , said the second one .
why the out@@ flow of the association has not been revealed in detail , the judge asked .
the organisation is not interested in detail for the financing of finance , it would only have been the debt of debt , the answer .
in 2011 , when investigations began an investigation of official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the national bank account .
these were rep@@ atri@@ ated , declared the accused .
this value of securities ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known as the association &apos;s testimony .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
that did not know the response for a long time .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the organisation .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have realised something of that money , the prosecutor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , of the functioning of the officials .
this assignment has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why compensation ? , Judge and Prosecutor wanted to know .
the first accused stated that he was not admitted to this formulation , because the association never suffered damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
he said the functional , he never covered a cent salary , he counted just o@@ il@@ ti@@ pping and di@@ ets .
he charged the Association for 1,000 euros per month , but the actual work would have been much higher than he added .
exact documents for the early years could not suggest the accused .
these were according to an operating examination , in which everything was judged correctly , no longer been kept , they declared .
o@@ er@@ rans@@ om also included the second accused .
all per@@ missions are in cash , in addition , he had to leave from his home town international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , in his asser@@ tion .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard st@@ alls further 30,000 jobs
in addition to the ongoing personnel loss for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build further jobs during the adv@@ anc@@ ement of the company .
the position of the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) has no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25.000 to 30.000 jobs in his company &apos;s customers .
this is due to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company distributed the company on Tuesday .

time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching when the US music Bank has two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest will be raised or not .
a survey among 80 o@@ con@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view , found that the F@@ ed will continue to remain somewhat longer and the interest rates remain at the current status of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , since it has been seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest rates on NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky view of global circumstances .
it warned the markets , warned on an increase , but signs indicate that the chances are towards a step good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death De@@ aths at Delta State University , leaving a letter of debt
after shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleague later , Sh@@ annon said a note to say that it was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted to do it , &quot; he could not do it , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot on someone , and someone was slain .
on the other hand , the staff of emergency alert said that police should send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can inter@@ fere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb no explanation for his shots .
when police came down the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note of lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to reverse it .
I loved Amy , and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , about 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police ra@@ ging him .
University @-@ President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
in spite of the reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities on Tuesday give it no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was told by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en that she said about seven years married , as a &quot; good man . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter , who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; by the ground . &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were her daughter , &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s who had a dog called Light@@ ning had met for about three years with lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called to a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the woods , killing themselves with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , the Delta State University granted a doctorate in the Delta State University , how his life is based on the university &apos;s website .

so far , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline is under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which produces three quarters of 2013 annual turnover of € 30 billion .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for two fra@@ k@@ tur
in the Champions League defeat Manchester Shaw held a double Fra@@ k@@ tur of his right B@@ one at the Champions League of Manchester .
while doing so , Louis van Ga@@ al gave up his hope for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw can play back in this season .
the injury was caused by a crazy attack of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Shaw had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has twice a fra@@ grant and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens .
he had a oxygen m@@ ash in the dressing cabin .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ grant , the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a river El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rator had mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card had been due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how ch@@ ases me , my way to recovery starts now , I will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hier@@ archy : Manchester United suffers from the loss of Luke Shaw about the defeat at PS@@ V
the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive to recover from the European Championship in France for the next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
speaking with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ spiel on Chris Sm@@ alling .
you certainly knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing to learn all his parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not last long until you know it almost entirely .
be it , you may be David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favorite child@@ r@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to die in 1971 from Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following passage , in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book , instead of giving a summary of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to expand the fairly brief original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to see their desire to see a real tree , she reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el , and who died in 1991 , is totally unknown .
as if that &apos;s still not yet still susp@@ icious : the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey , to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron stands the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cov@@ et@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ cking , fri@@ vol@@ ous beings , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in one child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons elec@@ oms office .
super@@ camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons has been delivered , but there was no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen the United Kingdom for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series doesn &apos;t appear on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a down@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is probably less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the shared spirit is strong ; they will not carry any s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops himself as Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
related message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves out of the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ ters are targeted at results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , since - and I said this - players have their own choice .
long ago it had been extended to the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he goes out again for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the Great Britain &apos; Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t bring forth as good achievements , and that surprises me ; he is primarily a team man .
the question , how much time does a test punch gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton won nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ turn .
the only accus@@ ation that one could rise was that England first used Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a bu@@ zz , which I ad@@ mitting high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire &apos;s early season , when he met 236 for us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances of winning it , but it depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een in addition to Cook suggest what would bring a extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks , and I did nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ang@@ ing can not hit there , and this link has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not finish his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for them , and there is no difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before being re@@ signed as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he has made three hundred re@@ els immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited work with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 with the ball , and think it &apos;s a P@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inning , lift up their hands and the coach did decide for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England made a few wise supplements while exercising .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , could be a master coup consultant .
he is one of the most powerful guys of the game , which will bring a lot of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white sphere stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and how Mah@@ ela has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said .
coll@@ ys team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the one @-@ Day@@ ers , root has a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some cannot agree , but co@@ aches and team controllers do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that , as in players , their jobs will depend on results .
such decisions are not taken in light heart .
Bre@@ xit @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ xit = out of Britain from the EU ) could win over supply if the economy becomes a flame device until 2017
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ paid new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep Great Britain in the EU , even without having the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jeremy &quot; Is It Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which was severely beaten up on Tuesday due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at told us that some member states , so deeply seduc@@ ed in various crises , as the EU is now and not always made out of own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with divided conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contrac@@ tual changes , which mostly don &apos;t want to be satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at their annual meeting that it does not like it , if they are threatening the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photograph of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they would win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants to be looking out to the United Kingdom in the interior of the EU celebration - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and goes through that more and more short @-@ wise ministers and civil servants come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as it did in the exagger@@ ate like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a pale force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist @-@ right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they are going to ri@@ p a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be used to prevent Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies did .
therefore , some such ministers may not be inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful comments , all in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s speech campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my boy@@ friend is susp@@ icious .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the new business . &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its own costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the Oli@@ gar@@ chie of the press bar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n inspired speakers in 1975 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you may remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name for a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his dis@@ cour@@ agement , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
in addition , the Med@@ ley was assigned by tax @-@ fear@@ ing sh@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ able foreigners and the p@@ seudo non @-@ foreigners who have most of our big newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noted that when you &apos;re sitting with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you can better spread the ban@@ anas in order to stop him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , the band had more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself when he turned out Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s refer@@ ral verteb@@ ra@@ e , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened his back@@ door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time to spend more for me - seems to repeat in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch .
it may take , but it needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe is - I &apos;ll put it friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ u@@ b@@ ic Ten@@ dency and the wild vessels of Tor@@ es Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and television this week , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting in him fought , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father worked on television , loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleague , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expressed - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his supporters and members after all reports on Monday evening .
what ever wants to conv@@ ey the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even has touched me - News Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the stru@@ del of social media , a breeding place of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in speech campaign for self @-@ understand@@ able such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental beliefs to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion on the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of small intest@@ ines is a central basis of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities in Nato - Tom Watson , it is convinced that J@@ C does not start the campaign - will foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they even have mi@@ tig@@ ated voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the USA are already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , as soon as I was remin@@ ded of something the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on E @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , began to critici@@ ze by the Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have asked the capability of data in@@ qu@@ ire and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading editorial in the journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily &quot; basis , &quot; which P@@ he justified his principal conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers have written in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on proof of its effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public claim that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions about the damage of different nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ half products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were presented in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained that funds from an e @-@ cigarettes case was given , but not the financing that he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to be maintained .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a industry financing in paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line led by P@@ he also took part at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for damages of most products with most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee wrote and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations in the P@@ he report is discussed .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J was re@@ acted to the alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifetime smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are small compared to that , but we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear obligation to information the public on what the evidence occupies and what is not , especially if it gives so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80,000 people are dying every year in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the national healthcare system £ 2 billion a year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should leave East@@ er@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4
the former chair@@ woman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ en@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival would give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they should see publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen from a smaller audience , in hard controversial times of time against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and radio stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , commented on the company to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tries to come into contact with the BBC for six years .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs were commissioned or sends , which would also be shown clearly by not subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communic@@ ations@@ Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think about it or long @-@ term , one should set up his production at least on programs that do not do or put it on behalf .
they send the voice in a first time window , because they want to achieve a wide support for their future .
the idea that nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be publicly @-@ true television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s blame is on the hunt for reviews , &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to safegu@@ ard long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will again give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ l@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ avi@@ an programs can &apos;t measure to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they may argue if they have created their apparent missions to justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ completely ; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window , in which no one wanted to see them ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions , who can obtain the best value hier@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you are all thinking that you will receive a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said only little by the BBC production would now be classified as formation . he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take up to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , elabor@@ ate and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only one hand@@ ful of television are shown to go online , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders Alli@@ ances to make everything online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by particles of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have to be heard on high frequencies for the human hearing in order to be heard .
the impul@@ ses are working through the en@@ roll@@ ers of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react on ultras@@ ound waves .
more to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stimul@@ ation , inv@@ enting an inv@@ asi@@ sive process that prevents electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of human disease symptoms .
F@@ aden@@ worms react normally not on ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ az@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , enhance ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate the worms .
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves function on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the waves are the opening of this ion channels and enable the cells that they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ ions are TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when used ultr@@ asonic on the changed cre@@ atures , the waves of sound are intensi@@ fied by the micro@@ bubble and transferred to the worms , where they switch the modified mot@@ on@@ ers .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to in@@ struct neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be lowered to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound tissues can occur un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make human neur@@ ons temporarily to make an ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

in September , there will be a warm of w@@ aff@@ le tra@@ ilers with the D@@ LR ... customers will be asked to help at the stop of the tru@@ ce fair .
the 300 posters are from artists who exhibit their work in the museum for cru@@ ell@@ ous designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack Packs , &quot; a 6 £ pack from Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to some one @-@ third of bus stops on the planet &quot; will achieve . &quot;

one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will be critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists make themselves together with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters sal@@ utes the comm@@ uter in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was reviewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ice@@ over artist who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt Le@@ ver was astonished at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the fair - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the light of bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have done a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen the awareness of illegal torture machines at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need is a collapse of the British government and the guarantee that torture units are not negotiated in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the creative art around the fair trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors are simply ign@@ ited .

eight Golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence at a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the attached smile of those who I &apos;ve been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve lear@@ nt , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the train in student residence is ranging from easily irrit@@ able up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to tell : people tell whence you come , where you stand in reference to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you say , honest , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , Boys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through . breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out people who like to do in contrast to those with whom you do not speak , even if your l@@ ashes would be in fire , and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people of people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people go and their under@@ wear .
referring to : don &apos;t think to start the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted receive a rough handling at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence form a room @-@ to @-@ room b@@ um@@ ble@@ bee culture , which is friendly and soci@@ ally and to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a compromise is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him a SMS instead .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residence I had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship with che@@ eks .
since you start the Uni at the peak of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the clo@@ ak is at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have some cra@@ ck . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats are a good way to close friend@@ ships .
their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves , and will have to associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , it depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping , when you anchor .
steal food is an ordinary crime in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it take a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are , they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ates who added her milk a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should make no noise , which keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being an employed person , but that in the true sense of the verb@@ s , people belong to people who are sitting in gl@@ ash@@ out .
a girl on my hall asked her neighbours , whether it makes them something , drum &amp; bass slightly qui@@ eter than it was at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded to him with even lau@@ tern music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they sent her neighbours to sleep two hours before joining their own music , shut their door and ended up for her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would coinci@@ de into the same student residence ?
vice versa , it would not be pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ed , if you have a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses , they have to separate , and then you will see each day and perhaps to see how they move all common friends to yourself ?
of course , the heart is his own path - but if a hot fellow country@@ woman is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to talk a little reason for your stay .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not closed rooms , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing being more than it seems .
a good stress is funny , but it takes just moments , until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
simply share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never miss any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and put their keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but tor@@ ches your poss@@ essions to the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , everyday life ,
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds for people who have not much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need dor@@ ms , but also the only survi@@ ving mother and the Ger@@ aring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build very well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds inside a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing onto the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have sustainability .
because people are staying in a large part here .
in view of refugee electricity we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ ales , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a small house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates the integration .
that is different , if people under@@ scores the people in flats .
each of the six houses , which are built just in the pilot project , consists of three apartments each for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it &apos;s back peace , I go back .
then the houses can be rebuilt easily after their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without plot .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took place six months .
that is reasonable .
did buildings have complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have correct my project correctly .
it &apos;s always difficult to make the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ke special construction and the slot system .
gr@@ assy ground .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury goods for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not correct .
but will you not tigh@@ ten the launch of affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true , however , we had a building boom in Germany last five years , but built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not just fu@@ gi@@ tives , but also the only survi@@ ving mother or the Ger@@ ing Ear@@ ener .
I show how one can also build and well @-@ build today .
that &apos;s why it is .

iOS 9 : how to receive the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some are encountered after installation problems , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to wait either until the storm dates back or try to update on iTunes .
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the delete of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the wear of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install the process once the process is complete .
it is worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during update or is located near a loading device , so that the battery is charged .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not allow the update as the phone may go on half @-@ way , and this could lead to a departure of the updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have gathered under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new start to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
besides consultations , you can also participate in courses there .
the Social Foundation is moving down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , we will immediately get seniors and advice on questions such as nur@@ ses or nur@@ ses and nur@@ ses .
since years we have been engaged in our out@@ patient care service , that often in@@ ad@@ joining persons can be left alone .
there are infinite variety of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there aren &apos;t seldom used many benefits of the insur@@ ers because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the new budget in J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ s office offers prevention , health insurance and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement one another in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .

Dr. Frank Müller takes charge of training breaks and invested 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen .
also samples of Zambia is also delighted with Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promotion in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places on the land , doctors at As@@ endorf are missing , Dr. Frank Müller delivered the practice Fel@@ low there on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing in his successor in the next few months with a half point to the page .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met whom she currently complet@@ es her medical examination in the hospital and will also enter practice in practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well in this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller made the idea to run its own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss .
and so one was settled , the tr@@ ash bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
twice the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller grew up in various medical practices and hospitals in various medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ zel .
he is currently working as a Consult@@ ant in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Partner Consult@@ ant in Di@@ ep@@ holz . volunte@@ ered on the DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ ing works as a house@@ cian she speci@@ alizes his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ tin ) on Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ ets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion , the rooms are modern .
we offer more ultras@@ ound examination as well as long @-@ term - and loading EK@@ GS , and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V will be re@@ done completely .
the costs of a total of 50000 Euros will receive the Mü@@ llers within a support program of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; st@@ resses ejac@@ ulates Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll every quarter in the practice Fel@@ low , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is still another home practice .
a positive side effect of clinical practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low in As@@ endorf .
if there was no successor , it would have gone .
those who visit Mü@@ llers consultation is , Inci@@ dentally , particularly in confi@@ dential faces : takes over the seven medical specialised and the cleaning force of the rim .
with their farewell end in As@@ endorf , an era , after all , the physician practice for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ oh@@ ausen sm@@ iles .
a little gro@@ aning is twi@@ sted after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is compl@@ aining : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I pushed me in front of my garden , now that could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and travels to travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are driven on our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Internal Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after that , it is clear that anyone who wants an asylum application to make it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept infinite migration flows , also not over the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it needs an controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia rejected
the Croatian government had previously noti@@ fied that Slovenia wants to travel further for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and we may also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather be the monitoring of the border - mainly to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an outer edge of the Schengen area .
as the Minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians will not expect its borders for refugees but not factories .
&quot; each EU member must fill its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; the Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government had ha@@ sted , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to pass in the eastern Croatian border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police managed to attack them in the near corn@@ fields .
according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police vehicles have been constantly meeting with new refugees .
it mainly concerns Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with some 4000 refugees , Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
there were also buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo on the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which previously carried out migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , informed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to suggest a certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; was called it .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses would expect .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany
the passengers were travelling around the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia all night around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has agreed , so the police told us that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , it could actually be a somewhat far@@ med shift from the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a slightly further west @-@ west route .
Croatia : &quot; extensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously empha@@ sized that his country prepared plans for the fall of a strong inf@@ est@@ rogen of refugees prepared plans for possible exceptional circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lead strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have consistently followed a good testimony since then , as regards the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ a@@ ean site stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ au@@ n about 300 refugees .
according to report of media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transi@@ tions would continue to remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Internal N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday at a local point in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed for earlier .
it would not happen to act very high refugees .
it could not be said , if they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers and migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to spread the refugees maps , where alternative routes through Croatia are marked .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border there are still 20 years after the end of the war , it still didn &apos;t meet mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police informed that a team of mine@@ fields was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ den@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als who is accused of having made an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
insi@@ ders should have been made to finance markets with the captured information .
thus , in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were be@@ ating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country are ultimately imprisoned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SEC message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further evidence continued in the case .
most of the accused were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .

you control the two stops of the Mannheim Motor Show at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
the rail@@ ways are holding .
pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ enti@@ ous life at stunning autumn sun cou@@ pon and afternoon , four big boards each with the inscription &quot; Before I die &quot; ....
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helped this action on its twenty @-@ year existence and is definitely confron@@ ted with mixed responses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is life , so we have been with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ ai@@ ds is also available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and discussions as volunteers .
while some pass@@ over spontane@@ ously attacks the chal@@ k and the sentence to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can continue to &quot; stop &quot; the war , &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then continue .
again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action , about life , dealing with the death .
Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is also on site .

this is therefore the public @-@ effective operation for the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds good .
it is understand@@ able that everyone on the tablets will make public understand@@ able , but finally it was a very personal issue .
the subject of death and death was det@@ ri@@ mental to as with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , especially the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed much to these people to open .
an estimate that Angel@@ ika &apos;s Go@@ def@@ roid shares .

the boards described on Saturday are now in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1a ) and the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
there can also be other personal desires on postcards there too .
Fed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
Fed@@ Ex dis@@ covers dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant f@@ rank its profit outlook for a whole year due to weak@@ est demand for freight service and higher costs in its boat transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point , in the past year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to take up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 per cent at the pre @-@ market trading in 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which will end in May , 20 cents less than at the previous forecast .
analysis expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the smaller view comes in spite of the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective January 4 and , despite the higher conditions for boat transport , of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said that despite the previous year , the result was expected to increase the result of cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company produces &quot; solid earnings , &quot; when switching the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations have been announced a day later when the rival UPS announced , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just under the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research reported analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks predicted analysts were expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has given a decline in high priority products over the past few years , receiving revenue in its unit Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results for Fed@@ Ex ground .
in the final quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result fell because of higher labour costs .
in the market trading , roughly one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares decreased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
at most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the lead for the first time since almost a decade .
confron@@ ting over them at an end of the galv@@ anized , two @-@ story seating set is located a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder of that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen , and their colleagues set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from the Congress : maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices remained stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ defeated third @-@ term mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate , the X factor in a decision may be too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented interest rate by the near @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets are already anxi@@ ous to strengthen this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za said the boss in the bro@@ ker company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty is around the global market enough to justi@@ fication , continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which is uns@@ ure in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a interest rate this week .
financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an which only shows a 30 % chance to increase .
this suggests a decline in stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the str@@ ist rests the blow by telling that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages around 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or around 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy predic@@ ts the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t fall into panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate hike will calm down the financial markets , because they will do the uncertainty when the F@@ ed will be removed .
another month , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that in this year despite the dis@@ miss@@ als of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition could be expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in the labour market was solid in this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to levels that accompany the F@@ ed as full@@ time .
wage increases have shown evidence of recovery .
although the inflation remained constantly under the 2 % threshold of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can tackle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension in the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world finished in the end of the month after China had util@@ ised its currency .
in May , the Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % below its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would face global growth .
the market has recovered slightly in this month , with the Dow dividend for nearly 10 % under the h@@ edge of May .
for the F@@ ed representative , the market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation , when you increase interest .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not have occurred in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US music Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty on what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is not one of the principal markets of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making decision .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere critic of the then conductor Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could have their monetary expansion &quot; nar@@ row@@ ly &quot; carried out confusion about the globe .
in a world where markets and economies , increasingly , are expected to monitor from the F@@ ed representative to monitor it not only the developments at other locations , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ ack@@ ers , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction to finance market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic foundation data . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , made a interest rate for interest , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their conduc@@ tivity by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ ack@@ ers said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representative made these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place as the 2008 market break , Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ence come not near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a interest rate because the markets become exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains twice the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it would be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little life assistance for refugees
more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
a warm welcome to them , does not go without the engagement with countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a whole number of people who support non@@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ dic@@ ate Society Rio Grande encour@@ ages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ al Organization SP@@ RS attempts to clari@@ fy women on a sho@@ cking way women , how important good nutrition during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with images of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should have the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy eating of the child may affect the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried council approved the building contract for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ed turn@@ around at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are step forward by step forward : in the most recent communal meetings , the elabor@@ ated construction application was closed down without great discussions .
previously , the panel , among other things , had decided to apply an application for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ect@@ ful &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid building plan .
in the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permit a special form in terms of the roof construction .
therefore a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ part first and roof terrace &quot; are set to be erected .
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully big South of South Korea , &quot; says Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the liberation of liberation , in turn around the roof , that was prescribed for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan no &quot; exceptions &quot; - with the amber of the common community usually drives more restric@@ tive in liber@@ als in liber@@ als .
but there is no recur@@ rent project at the gymn@@ asi@@ um structure : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um structure at the sports centre is a joint project of the church and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are calculated to approximately 2.3 million euros .
grants are expected from school and latitude .
next to the end of the procedure , construction application for the 18 x 36 meters will now be presented to the Council of Land@@ wise .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and majority of employees are pulling from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to P@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district coun@@ ters , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White was confirmed .
however , the Supervisory Board will meet a decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans should be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to continue .
the overwhelming majority should be moved with fishermen and the further existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
the employees , who cannot go to ch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered the change of resignation from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is not only since the beginning of the beginning of the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and now moves to a private practice in immediate proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question who will succeed , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the game that declared itself ready to take the line on 1st October and changing his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ emaker and de@@ fibrill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the center of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board has ended to agree to the Supervisory Board , until then , next year , the former hospital of the rat@@ ern@@ ity , which has more than 35 beds , will definitely be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
it has been planned for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment has been completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
Prime Minister J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , re@@ signed the rum@@ ours that the house that is owned by the federal government is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say there are several consider@@ ations .
there are currently a short @-@ time care of car@@ itas and an tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better couldn &apos;t happen to us , such an opportunity will not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fishermen over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a leader in the fisher@@ man for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , sections were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand side of the Rhine @-@ Neckar lion is now on the evening ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at Berg@@ ische HC .

the police suspected the cor@@ pse of the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate since Saturday .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the location on the German residential market is keen .
more refugees seek a affordable lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction stands in front of a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German residential market have long begun .
with the coming refugees and ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more people push for a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens to pay the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
in this result , a study on behalf of the association &quot; social housing &quot; comes .
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live on asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many are then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Office of Statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of housing market is not only aimed at the rising refugee .
the study also makes significant failure in housing policies of recent years .
Germany ra@@ ins a housing deficit which becomes greater from year to year .
at present , Matthias Günther , author of the study compl@@ ained about 77@@ 0,000 units in the metrop@@ olitan areas .
so many professionals settled in large cities in flat @-@ room rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily because of the flood on the housing market to stay longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square metres per capita has been decl@@ ining for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ en@@ tives are to stimul@@ ate social housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be ab@@ stain@@ ed on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax and the government tax for funded homes will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Alliance attractive tax @-@ amor@@ tis@@ ation opportunities be necessary .
the refugee programme for refugee shel@@ ters at the State Bank Kf@@ W has already been working well in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start was completed on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
after Hungary there is practically no coming through , since then more refugees choose the way through Croatia .
Zagreb announces , transit across Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les to the North .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate via the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister for Agriculture , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU country is not a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees collapsed in Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV broad@@ caster RTL .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to leave refugees .
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic declared : &quot; you can travel , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of them were reports of media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both with the bus and taxi in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they tried to get on foot about the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees fail to reach Gren@@ zz@@ ences .
thereby the border stri@@ pe other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ fields should now create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border , Hungary comes to Hungary after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 listed people .
shortly before Tor@@ sten on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the over@@ coming and damage of the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ ourselves as a criminal .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convicted were pen@@ alties of up to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration Camp , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers were used on Tuesday in the new &quot; Tran@@ sessions &quot; border with almost all - 93 - the most important transition in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has received a prosp@@ ect of granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right asylum seek@@ ers are to be deported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to wake up workers .
they collected a garbage which had left the tens of thousands of people over the road in the past few weeks .
pl@@ gri@@ lles were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps at the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the objective of this reconstruction .
Austria reached only a few refugees after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
but in the country , around 20,000 migrants still sat down in the country .
in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train trip from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
Mayor came from the Border &quot; on the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the rooms when ten people stood with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So W@@ ern@@ ess Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was un@@ expect@@ edly due to the refugee camp on Sunday , however , for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who offered immediately his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously , we had the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and beverages .
we said the same way , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N @-@ speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; it was very pleased to us , &quot; says the Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train in W@@ els , a regional train towards Pass@@ au has switched on Sunday evening to follow the road traffic to Germany after the short term , but still strug@@ gling over the border .
but the regional train was removed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein at Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , cross @-@ border is generally high in class .
the bridge firm linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , days before a branch @-@ cross country - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án will now send further Z@@ ig@@ ars to us , is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of resol@@ ving the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp on the construction of structures , our Federal Chancellor was highly official and publicly ger@@ minated in the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis der National Soci@@ alism .
bodies of this policy are not only those Austrian , which are now confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
also the poultry people will need to find that the &quot; yellow land , &quot; which they invited and welcome , has nothing but a refugee camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge , given the persistent refugee flow and the approaching winter , to make us decent conditions for refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search of 35,000 shopping quarters
Konrad , with refugee enter@@ tain , Konrad has filled all hands full .
Christian Konrad , it is used that his Word has its weight .
the government is employed by the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to aband@@ on Qu@@ arti@@ s for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first admission center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad , has already received a grip on .
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a great vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Master@@ power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , the Ministry of Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ known situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad is expecting an average of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ s in the he@@ uris@@ tic year .
in order to fulfill the number , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to provide the federal states .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; Konrad .
with the state army , he already led talks .
they would have secured him , too , to create qu@@ arti@@ s for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Lower Austria it goes well , &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help .
great expectations continues to coordin@@ ate the asylum coordinates into the ORF action &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot;
private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergency hours , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ s have to hold a certain height of hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ holder or size .
for a temporary time , &quot; Not@@ standards &quot; would have to apply .
in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , he was a successful basis for the Ministry of Interior , Konrad , with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , whom you do not yet say further into the face of un@@ truth .
persu@@ asion is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er no charge of the Republic , as they declared itself .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the individual search for Qu@@ arti@@ s was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to set a container on a st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz demands a better division
first , no opening of municipal sports and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , since it can be subject to those affected without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , further locations will be tested on their capability .
critic@@ isms of the city &apos;s government on distribution of refugees inside the Federal State .
other districts need to make their contribution here .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ag@@ inger ( VP ) announced his request in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic must continue .
however , there is the corresponding boundary controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
however , the protective search would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
by the other EU member states , P@@ ag@@ inger once challenged once more increased solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria returns to its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ag@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the approach of Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New Shi@@ pyard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry Line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production buildings , the Stock Exchange has moved S &amp; T listed , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT our smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies of the new shi@@ pyard and later also to ak@@ qui@@ es .
even starting from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to each third of the city Linz , the land Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is distributed by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are in the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ ite wanted to get a dog .
this project had to shift the 49 @-@ year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade , finally , in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , compared to business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything is turning to women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la brand , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; for a long time I thought I was to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it .
the decision was also decisive for the decision , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a very own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only one in the big space Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has grown italian roots .
her fashion interest has laid por@@ it from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most suitable for me when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , can also answer the specialist with recent security .
maybe it is because a nice bag is enhanced every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from one place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property connects man@@ or with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he expresses itself extern@@ ally hos@@ tile , journalists , as regards or knowledge of knowledge in international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential election sh@@ ag@@ ged the campaign to suff@@ ice .
and cut well off .
this is also registered in the pf@@ z@@ ical K@@ all@@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate markets come from .
the New Yorker , with the p@@ am@@ ese , is a concept in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the wine route .
man@@ ders in the 1200 inhabitants is more than -@@ zig corners to be related to him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign .
the young painter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about the tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about its goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that &apos;s somehow exciting , but in its K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter kind are not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has directed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous Spr@@ ints , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to Word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also den@@ si@@ ze@@ al the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; was a little m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , named K@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the investors , says she .
the tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the US in the US .
the foundation stone of the estate companies were first basic sales in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their wish , to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once guarded without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ ov@@ arian history and folk findings , Roland Paul , declared a film star@@ tup .
tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ going mig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ ek statements of the desc@@ endant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and required the construction of a border wall to re@@ loc@@ ust illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as does the pol@@ itely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote control of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a native Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump comes from ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cares about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ it@@ ess Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter men@@ tions that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family , Heinz in a visit to the Church &apos;s organ , concluded something very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t find it better if he won &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical vision , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were at the time of his grandfather in the US had been doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Bü@@ hler .
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

today , Today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in recent months , Today , today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise is on average 34@@ ,000 spectators at 38@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Sal@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama about a recent father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the ra@@ ster Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes &quot; .
the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and beat slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz @-@ show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( from 5 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jum@@ ped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening the first half an hour from The Chase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot sea average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Chase Australia will always be confident that hot @-@ sea level will ultimately be at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar , which didn &apos;t make the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show too .

the final three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki perhaps have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at the Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was covered in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left girl will certainly not give price if she is the person who has received the last Rose .
but when we talk to Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may have acci@@ dentally made a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday .
all three women agreed on ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and called his mind for hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was to get the last Rose ? , &quot; could their answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except ourselves - Mack@@ ay as best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a very simple relationship between the first day of the day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and of the energies , I noticed that they were fairly compatible , and I thought that they were pretty compatible with , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I &apos;ve seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well @-@ suited as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the visit @-@ visit was last week that Wood could be &quot; One &quot; could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m subject to him now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , W@@ hom he should choose , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast at Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent after its impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game when he lost a sm@@ ash like it lost a ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt return and also into the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ swear Cam See reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his patented cat@@ ches and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ y@@ d Hay@@ ne is patented in a P@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of Minnesota Vi@@ kings .
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian wake @-@ up for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later she talked to the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start at his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing which is coming now , one takes care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ on viol@@ ates the cuts with its Origin debut in 2007 when a passport in its own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .

the visitor survey of the free voters t@@ opped until Friday in the local Commun@@ e .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the theme for asylum seek@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called on the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to say about the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger asked even more staff for the administrative court , which is responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the FW boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent with : &quot; we need both consistent standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more powerful . &quot;
however , the regional policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt shall not fall under the table .
a years of long @-@ term burner remains on the agenda : the educational field policy .

but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; the FW boss said .
we demand freedom for all gymn@@ asi@@ es who want to .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen will shoot at prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police g@@ mig@@ ra@@ de in a crowd of crowd corro@@ bor@@ ated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer said that over 1,000 prot@@ esters have gathered outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and then shot down into the air before they res@@ orted to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it wasn &apos;t clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse possessed , of which it is known that they may kill them , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , evi@@ dently a high death rate produced .
the conflict was the last in weeks of non@@ violent protests in Nep@@ als , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ob@@ i say that new provinces , formed in the context of the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the elec@@ trop@@ ic group , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were forced into violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been gover@@ ned for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the leg@@ islat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ islat@@ ure signed this week over certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into effect on Sunday .

under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which presented the investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ inger went to the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; we still did not answer any questions , &quot; he said before the board members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ our now .
the project has risen from ten to 12 million euros in the discussion for months .
heavy reactions under marine owners who came into the meeting called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Mr Schulz , director and member of the Executive Committee of the Ab@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a big cl@@ ot@@ z , which over@@ sees all the others . &quot;
in addition , he fears like some other project critics , that the traffic would be heavily polluted by the intended size of the system : &quot; there must be whole bus@@ ses , so that &apos;s the calcul@@ ator , &quot; says Schulz

Google starts dou@@ bling funds campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling pro@@ curement campaign to help the thousands of refugees to help the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach at the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who had fled with Kabul &apos;s family when she had fled to her own personal experience seven years ago .
&quot; on our journey there were many dark railroad and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people look like my family desper@@ ately for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : physicians without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / is raised to $ 11 million .
Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

for easily over@@ ge@@ tic diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether easily ob@@ ese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live as those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new trial in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss of loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to shr@@ ink the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity operations conducted for type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies were performed in people who are living in ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI of 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have been collected in a study since 2007 , compare two kinds of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes by people who were easily overweight .
the average BMI of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI of those who non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ gone a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disorder solved them , and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes has completely dissolved itself with only one percent in comparison , and in some cases , only about two percent .
moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also supervised the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , increased back@@ doors in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and a rather complete re@@ wind of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit in surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , Black@@ stone says by the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent an obesity operation , approximately 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soo@@ thing for people interested in a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have manifest@@ ed their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a reverse is really difficult . &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is currently engaged in fiction : a young woman , high school times un@@ popular and un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable , meets the flock of her youth after years , and this fell in love with her .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe could not take all the refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end the violence in the refugees of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , which is devoted to eth@@ ics .
he requested that in these circumstances the interests of humanity must be put before the interests of the individual nations , or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to be admi@@ red in the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama comm@@ ended Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine evolution , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
ultimately , we need to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama spoke to the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that violent reaction of the USA went into a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , his moti@@ ves were good , but he sat on violence , and that has unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants through children over the last 4 years
tox@@ ins centers in the U.S. report on a nearly 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swallowed up alcoholic hand infection , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lopez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues increased by hand infection in children under the age of 12 , reported the tox@@ ins centres , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lopez CNN . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children are disinf@@ ect@@ ant to drink , while some of them do to im@@ press friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink just because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ water to preserve the tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lopez .
many of the more attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ c@@ ous .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with strawberry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially among young children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ emergency center at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky and let people leave this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come on it , it &apos;s a fast way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from the strawberry du@@ ar@@ dis@@ infection in the school , has been brought to treatment .
her blood concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold that was combined with an adult law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ch physician who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency department .
doctors overs@@ aw the night in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma when the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; says Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN .
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to store and disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s range .
on alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of hand infection , which ab@@ stain@@ ed a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product me@@ thanol is contained , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol which was noted as an active substance .
in January he planned three students of the fourth class in the State of New York , their &quot; m@@ ild@@ ly &quot; teacher , claiming anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand infections and banned them from their space .
the police entered the failed plan as &quot; Sovi@@ ets , &quot; and demonstrated discipl@@ ined measures to the school authority .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to that .
the lack of cover competition in Scottish football , bo@@ red by Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic Games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars by D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chief sul@@ or , to turn things around .

&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it just like - but we have to go on .
we really need to really know the support of Celtic because that makes the player better .
it is so important together now .

players who come in the summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is served by adding unnecessary players what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it rises in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged until July until July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to € 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the UK@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers shown by the National Statistics Office ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , employment fell to 12,000 during the three months with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan for government has laid the foundation stone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase of employment and a decline in unemployment .

why should I be a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late judicial intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator at the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ orer .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was first described in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and there are often more applications as places available , a mak@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take an emergency book and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to imp@@ ose my im@@ par@@ ality .
this is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she cleared , she said , &quot; It could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it is false , what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international reporter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work in the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benef@@ ici@@ aries of action .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood that he is not guilty of murder .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other repor@@ ters , which you can turn on .
what you can get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .
man sent to feu@@ dal police ch@@ ase , coming from the Cann@@ ing River

when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I come not out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to try , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to don@@ ate him and threat@@ ens to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy in its st@@ ables , and threatened to end the race right away .
he invited to the ste@@ wards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ test in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to look like too high @-@ wearing grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been waiting for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything goes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it &apos;s wide .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well tonight .
I &apos;d like to walk around the head , and I want my owner to think that I try my best for her .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more co@@ aches .
I need to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had uploaded the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity unit had tried to eg@@ es@@ pion@@ ate his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago there were Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I am asked - and to give him an employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
she apparently believe that I am an im@@ post@@ ure .
if that is the case , they certainly would express itself to their n@@ oses , because they have failed to express myself .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of Route L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this and are still today .
should it take me to think that it is personal ?
did the Route L behave responsi@@ bly , and perhaps people outside of Train@@ ers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there I &apos;m .
maybe they have to take me my license and leave me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the Fru@@ it levels of the train@@ ers have set up cob@@ alt examination in Li@@ dar@@ i and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to the fact that he could have &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ packed Master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing daily treatment session , &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud and clay was carried on the horse &apos;s ra@@ ges , which pushed the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
I must take the full responsibility for this , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my colleagues run ir@@ r@@ ently mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need to take rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against rival due to alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his player as a &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring@@ ing Games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett did a hardly covered note regarding the Storm team , after his crew had reached the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample @-@ example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy def@@ ending the tor@@ ches of his crew and said that she is only concentrated on their &quot; Contact &quot; in tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers on his team is confident that they were worried that they are worried about to be defeated by the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that appears forever - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring games when they struck us 24 : 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bell@@ amy told us on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything in our def@@ ensive System or the techniques throughout the year , but during the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles on a real main focus and that has produced the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to exercise . it is therefore likely to be used to lose it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange , as this happens again at this time of season .
Bell@@ amy Benn@@ ings attacked the idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that Benn@@ ys St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons who won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George became a bo@@ red team , and Wayne made that he will take care of a shit @-@ dre@@ ck .
but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play .
I build strong trust because they are saying these things because they are a bit worried against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster scored a higher score as the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is it an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not make a difference cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
when they mention , it means we will meet again in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend , since it won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ security deposit to drug cl@@ age
a man who possibly mis@@ ses a lifetime penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong sentence for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the cafe could have been harmless .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated to the court on Wednesday .
in case of the case , he lied to the police over his place to stay .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the active explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he received his Australian and his Serb pass , at the police a day , and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 .

he gave the search for searching for the computer of him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten a ped@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to attract them .
he said that he was sick in his head if he drinks , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder .
MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and at the crying .
she then looked the mot@@ ion@@ ic images on the phone and confron@@ ted the accused .

meteor@@ ologist warned against storm shops in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , distributed by German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful T@@ ief is the runner of the tropical forest , Henry , who passed over the Atlantic in the past few days .
heavy storms and th@@ under@@ storms are expected mostly in Baden .

the ground makes it : all two years show the high@@ ways at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , especially the movement for the compact car that we are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cars from compact class are currently in demand : approx . 2@@ 8.1 percent of new appro@@ vals cancelled according to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , all new compact models are presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand in the fall of dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann said at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
with this the volume model also sells well , the new Astra is to be much more expensive for it .
Opel presents a starting point below the largest Volkswagen Golf in the prosp@@ ect , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engine .
unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra launches the Opel Astra at first just one @-@ five .
the second version will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA 2013 .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra line @-@ up to the race .
at the fair , Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as Kom@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the greatly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti is fit with its curved lines full into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will have a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , is celebrating its world premiere .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new , but is completely re@@ designed to see the compact class DS 4 comp@@ lim@@ iting at the IAA 2013 .
outside , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers were on the front part of the front part : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed , reduced the number of kno@@ bs by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
on the IAA in the compact car , we are adding a series of over@@ working and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel &apos;s Justice Centre , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of violation of its human dignity , prisoners are fundament@@ ally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected may even suffer the judges , even if they were locked in confin@@ ed spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
consequently , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successfully completed in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who had been transferred to a large cell after the information of his An@@ fo@@ rested , was found in a bigger cell .
his mission statement because of the un@@ fortun@@ ate detention conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court took up the verdict of the Court in Berlin and referred to the case to re @-@ re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human being hurt .
Chamber Supreme Court now decides about the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons , only a few days of detention days are decisive for the compensation , a compensation was given .
otherwise , &quot; a leg@@ ation of the legal protection of personality would be feared . &quot;
the Chamber of chamber must now clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the judges often have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they first spoke in April a in@@ mate of damages because he was sitting naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 that the multiple allocation of a cell without a separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed a Dec@@ ent @-@ Dec@@ ent accommodation in a parallel case issued by a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place every day for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ achi case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the headlines in the last weeks also due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always shut down 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to sle@@ d@@ ship , it is said to have already occurred due to the attached situation .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 places are not occupied in Te@@ gel for a young man , 19 will fall in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany this year , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of resolution : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do that . &quot;
what comes to Germany , the following overview will be convey@@ ed .
it applies according to different projections between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all in paid hire objects : annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly convenient apartments as well as refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , aims to double its funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little has to be made from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year and therefore the federal government would have to invest a level of 6.4 billion per year .
in this regard , scientists and Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs are that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Studies , 55 per cent of the poultry were employed in Germany in the long term .
however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not systematically questioned after their qualification , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation of the Society of Society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a working prohibition for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dences , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a residence .
in society - even because of the gap of skilled workers - mainly the visible point of view is that refugees to be made faster than access to the labour market should be allowed .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
so far , there is no sufficient offer in general and based language courses .
studies also show that jobs will be convey@@ ed most frequently through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the Königs@@ weg on working integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only few fle@@ dged parents give their children into the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ails of parents , it is only once important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ li@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the Kit@@ a , the administration hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators climb heavily by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase their training capacity - by taking more technical colleges .
students without German students are prepared in welcome classes in the countries .
but they are not always taught by trained teachers and teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ acks from the Berlin school management .
the German student works estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany would like to study .
in principle , no Federal Reserve of asylum seek@@ ers or sc@@ ul@@ ded the study - the only exception was Berlin , inside @-@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) but has given up his attitude .
study approval could be facil@@ itated access to the university .
for refugees with a resident permitted or Dul@@ ce , no benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers will receive more when they start studying .
the latter is basically no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G as they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ authorised persons .
Ged@@ ul@@ fed refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible to be B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 due to a short@@ age of 15 months .
this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student works .
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many are the religion important within their identity .
the state should gradually unite the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches @-@ right to develop a new state @-@ religions ratio .
the foundation of a Islamic welfare association is also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , representatives of Islam must unite with some and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow certain control possibilities .
also , the read@@ iness to take heed to religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism also belongs .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , commented on Thursday to worry about religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in order to change the majority of the majority , the degra@@ dation of discrimination and rac@@ ism is under@@ going .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - since a decade of a decade , an anti @-@ discrimination law and a general act of equality .
but it lear@@ ns very slow , as the NSU @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and stakeholders to meet international agreements as long as for the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany , must remain in the next few years if the country will remain peaceful and let their new citizens use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care that previously expected refugees , the Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Capacities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accomplish this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the day mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , extra money has to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery serves to spread to all the di@@ aries in the registration of health .
subsequently , services could be calculated with the federal states .
and long term it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalog should be pe@@ eled to see the asylum seek@@ ers of asylum .
otherwise , doctors make doctors primarily to create language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved so far , migrants are clari@@ fied beyond their diseases than other patients .
Interpre@@ ting costs are not only accepted in clinics , also in medical surg@@ eries , calls for them .
many refugees too have been helped with more gener@@ alized medical operations in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic ga@@ ze .
among refugee camps , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and the young people go about HIV education .
in some other forms of illness , German doctors come from her training but clear , Mont@@ gom@@ ery believes .
&quot; the paras@@ ite fall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and as regards the doctors , the refugees may even be reli@@ eved in sight by refugees .
the Syrians have been a highly developed education system , some refugees and even doctors .
in order to be practic@@ ed , they would have to reject their quali@@ fications and ex@@ propri@@ ate tests again .
at least half of these refugees arrive in Germany , according to estimates of the Federal Patent ® ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or in depres@@ sions .
in particular , there are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich demonstrated that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , amongst others , is suffering from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs , with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart @-@ ha@@ v@@ ens and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms are chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have been given a psycho@@ therapy .
indeed , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a motion for therapy for psycho@@ therapy , but the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , social @-@ workers or doctors , who are not trained in social diseases , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to failure , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst goes back to the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and free entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst is inviting in the man@@ ege on the bricks and was@@ ps to the dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current man@@ oeu@@ vre .
for more than 33 years , the Circus is Pro@@ bst in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift to inspire is the family therefore in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take the people away from her everyday life and take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year old Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; real Estate with World city @-@ Fl@@ air , &quot; thus Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst is his concept .
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this fl@@ air .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces by talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with a joke and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent film , I want to capture the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art in the mast is to conquer women &apos;s storms in storm .
besides numerous salmon fill@@ ets the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with finger @-@ sensitivity and artic@@ ul@@ arity .

no problem for He yuan .
snake men@@ stru@@ s fascinating and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics how little different and intri@@ gu@@ ed with her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
abuse in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are just too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes place : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not our animals good , we also don &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every mat@@ ure@@ ly , approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a mat@@ uring session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from your eyes following the possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the ring .
so the first commandment is : good for the animals .
specially on her zeb@@ ily jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the family is proud of them .
the two animals lived in a ring for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the ring , but it &apos;s the unique mascot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in the Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims of the opposition from the opposition that they had received anonymous threats and warned them to accompany the response from Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ ehr@@ u@@ fen .
last month they b@@ lown it out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese stated that seven opposition politician SMS messages received on their cell phones that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ les &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not indicated but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man , who led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will be up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the scope of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
hp will be split up later this year into two listed companies and the computer and printer business of its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP told us in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair@@ person and Chief Executive , which is to split the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is focused smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and will be concent@@ rating on providing integrated technology solutions to businesses , &quot; such a statement of the company .
it is a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to create electrical equipment and the Palo Alto garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
hp has a massive restructuring process to tackle the conversion of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer , and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that rather focused companies can produce a better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it was only September and if his rehabilitation will go according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games to England and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of violation will not be threatened by career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it &apos;s a bone , which was not healed .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his ank@@ le or with the injuries which he had previously .
this may be true from purely medi@@ cally point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the related danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of season .
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ y &apos;s 157 lig@@ as@@ ars in the last five times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injuries ratio will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a long period of time in which you must strengthen your body and win fight power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will take a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea du Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger makes a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not having travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the courts with the largest assessment effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , based on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has moved the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by far hope to lead to his management the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it never worked with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship : the comedy show , which granted us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high @-@ och .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ es@@ ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) in 2015 announced the year of the man to ask the culture in question the men to seek care if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms suggested that if the body had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; its chances have doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of intellectu@@ ally healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that your friendship may work .
in the age of social media , communication with its focus on style is often more important than a significant contact form .
our digital life have the need to be strong , viable , and successful to appear , even if the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ates psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ine values ; money , image , social status , everything at costs in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that impact on our spiritual health much deeper .
and , like a vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on my head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , that was sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler stran@@ gling hu@@ gs , moments in football looks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can depend on each case , even if they are often ref@@ using to explore fully their feelings .
as a member of the phone call told me that ... &quot; My listen@@ ers &apos; cause for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ treated , has really shown me a difference how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not in the position to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old Rede@@ emer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come to right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to provide long @-@ term pat@@ ern@@ ity mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the little moments of men &apos;s kind@@ nesses .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status via telephone the people in eye view of despair may also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central friendship festival with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give it a smile and say hello .
you never know what the difference might make your friendship .

angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh son Cav@@ ani after his hits on Malmö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move on Malmö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Edinburgh , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts , who brought the French Master on the way , but after that , they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased its lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head@@ ball@@ point in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A takes Paris a strong start against the Swedish masters , since they are not only stri@@ ving for the first @-@ quarter rounds , but an improvement on the path to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class example of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ate opportunities before the gate . he was later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he began its lively career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our opponents to cause problems , even if there are certain things , which we have to perfect in the course of season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s a good fore@@ man .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have scored two other goals . &quot;
Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was held at the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but it was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean flu@@ gel@@ man was referred to as the man to take over PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United States , and he interpreted in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before calling on Johan Wil@@ and finished in the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic &apos;s in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined the An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field exc@@ uses a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they b@@ lows little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself gave himself up sometimes , with some errors and bad connections , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who had not been pat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he had a lot more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ers into the game , and it was a Pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which Di Maria was transformed into a shooting , which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er scored his sixth win , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all thoughts that Malmö came back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a gate in the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , was later to say that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
watch from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said , she won &apos;t need behind the scenes .
during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown who empha@@ sized the need of alternative perspectives and in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it with the movie of the film and not at the score of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted shocked , with off@@ ended dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian turns out .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben affair and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to think people to think about it - whoever will always be the director , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line that is sm@@ itten down by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their scrip@@ ture , &quot; at the end , could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;

the Twe@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes for his release .
women &apos;s comments come at a point where the exact r@@ attle representation in the media stands at the fore@@ front of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the Black Li@@ ves Movement created a nationwide effect and th@@ ron@@ ged leg@@ islat@@ ure and authorities to re@@ lie@@ ve discrimin@@ atory practices against far@@ my@@ ard .
in February , the singer Prince had made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published a statement in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News personality of Elisabeth Hass@@ el@@ beck , whether the group should be considered a hate group .
the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was invited on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or hit the Pope , it is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first Champion
professional sports weather and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let who won the American Ninja war@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , which was able to close all stages of his obst@@ acle course .
during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the finals .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climb rope was on the last task in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten finished the task within the time , with which he finished the first athl@@ ete , who finished the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Ninja war@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he finished first at all the circuit , did not get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , it will get the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he receives the great degree of gra@@ ti@@ fications .
I do not believe he will be a p@@ enny .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received lots of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same way when they had dum@@ ped the roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a full season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sli@@ pped over Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ APO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , however , played this part perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb up in a game side of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to hold about a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad P@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two races , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 interior and made it possible for three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year heavily , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of each game , and therefore I will completely concentrate in the game .
the designated Tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two rings , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits against Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; he sw@@ ung well the whi@@ p , &quot; said Aus@@ m .
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , saw clearly better from the bull@@ pen and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear , at the end of the seventh command , T@@ wins &apos;s best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ xton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colourful , and Simon launched his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left .
Har@@ dy rolled off the wall , the only man with whom he was confron@@ ted with the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ cat@@ cher Miguel S@@ ano , who designed a two @-@ run right to the right @-@ handed ro@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen .
with a couple of runners and the conclusion @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ge to a double play .
it was the major league leading in the Major League at the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe kno@@ cked a double Play
after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings added a Insurance @-@ Run , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano is out of three pitch for his fifth ring .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the beginning of the game by a still non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two routes against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injuries list more than a month ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt glad when I started and felt that I would make some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , H@@ was released a single on Second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was cast out of the game when he tried to get to the third as he finished the threat .
the Tig@@ ers entered the second , one one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not beaten very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hughes found himself in a pitch @-@ Count , not scored points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right @-@ Stand A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes , there came a three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stripes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sán@@ chez was due to a violation of the throw @-@ out .
it is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who underwent the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability due to a shoulder blade , should be activated for the launch on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris will be canc@@ eled by the vulner@@ ability to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , which has been acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he had ste@@ als in the right hip on 20 August due to a distor@@ tion in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Santana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected to be on Wednesday night .
they should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden like the city of Wiesbaden received on Tuesday evening .
they calculated with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the His@@ panic state capital have been prepared for this case last days .
there can be up to 1,000 refugees temporarily .
they will then be distributed on other municipalities .
in the last ten days alone , after the initial acquisition of the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Gießen , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have furnished refugees in sports halls because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , head of the Munich Security Conference , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the thinking about military action plans cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective change &quot; .
four years ago I was glad that the cup has passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Deutschland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced inspec@@ tions on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Foreign Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared to Hungary on Tuesday night at the Austrian TV ORF , and no one yet sent back to Hungary .
even Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; she explained .
on the question of an agreement to which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said that it had already been announced by the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
they did not call concrete figures and demonstrated talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees flew over the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is usually Germany .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for the next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states are unable to have a joint action in the crisis so far .
the European Interior Minister will want to take a new approach to the non @-@ binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries on the initial absorption and distribution of men .
at the end of Tuesday , the federal government announced that Merkel wants to call for almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in Berlin in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , be@@ ating this also .
but who didn &apos;t have a lead perspective , could not remain in Germany .
this view would have been dealt directly in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole has to overcome a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
meanwhile , thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck in the Balkans .

no diet @-@ fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but if you want to pay attention to his sl@@ ender , it is often de@@ pl@@ aten .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively much sugar - especially suc@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Before all , man@@ os contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta car@@ otene .
who eat the fruit , thus supports tend@@ on , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .

they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within less days .

while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture starts to st@@ ew on the Alp@@ illes slope .
here rain sets out a rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
to sum , south of the Alps must be reck@@ oned within the next 48 hours with partly over 100 litres of rain per square metre , this has already fallen large quantities during the last days .
on Thursday morning the hair dryer the air , in which episode rolled a cold front with a powerful , partially swe@@ ating rain from West to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind is strong until stor@@ my , and temperatures rise significantly .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
in Rome almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square .
in the presence of municipal President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino was bap@@ tised on Wednesday a well @-@ known square in the park on the Opp@@ io @-@ Hills on the name of the German re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ esp@@ ace was requested by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in secret about centuries as a minority .
with the place , in a symbolic manner , the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a glori@@ ously sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions would probably have expressed him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then had his Th@@ eses on the trade @-@ trading split into the western church .
Hammer artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works that has painted the Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and scrip@@ tural texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid imag@@ ery .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt who puts his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and screen in 150 moti@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and fan@@ ciful forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but by no means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the particular topics can be adjusted , that can be quite dark .
around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has met a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
we created cycles that are dedicated to issues like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or f@@ ath@@ erh@@ ood .
he intri@@ gu@@ ed spontane@@ ously many partners : this is true for Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological alignment as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and , above all , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost &apos;s author is , based on the basis of painting with the respective Bible positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ot@@ mar Alt and so in today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original Bible views of Martin Luther and each artist , one of the artist who puts his very personal thoughts on their respective situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden sl@@ et@@ ters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows almost twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately to be a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; the education was at least once with the cane , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to wake up that , perhaps to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re@@ lie@@ ve art in faster times more opportunities : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is characterized by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
images have a mysterious and mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they seem to have effect , discover and feel which power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image seeks to be his counter@@ over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation at the Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Foundation , which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like working with his images . &quot;
old did not seem to understand the Bible completely , but also selected among him important , mysterious topics .
&quot; it was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text clearly explained . &quot; it was created a picture @-@ Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ ller of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ ller both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition dedicated to the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on 15 November .
construction work for the BM@@ X track series
plans have made , place found , companies commissioned to model the site for a circuit : a year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was over again .
failure in politics and administration provided for understanding , especially with those who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train .
looking down hill , place new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission should go down in October , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ah @-@ Bock was now able to communicate in the child and youth committees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , the Bundesliga match a clear mark on the weekend .
football is respon@@ ding to the sp@@ ying situation in Germany and secu@@ res the policy on managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can no one say in principle that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in getting this issue in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and would help .
the decisive turn@@ outs needs to place the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the German football League has therefore strengthened his refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA Convention in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also , some federal states support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ b put a clear sign if they appear on the left hand @-@ hand link instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Hermes ) to help the &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ swear Rud@@ i Vö@@ ller of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; self @-@ understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every day , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use football @-@ govern@@ ors , no , we need to use our jet force , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already so incredibly low , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ ders managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent signs of the league . &quot;
for the European championships for Hungary on Friday , the national team of women for 100 refugees invites to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a major collabor@@ ator of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects would be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which we spent , will live in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will each provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kid@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : S &amp; D leader loses an eye in case of accident
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has reportedly lost the left eye for several reports , according to a fall in early July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped to midnight on a water glass , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ thirsty , she got up out tow@@ ed into the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Has@@ so Platt@@ ner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go on his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we met with the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was working with the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully unemployed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , will come back to Germany in October and lead to the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m fully for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
a Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every one can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s against Kras@@ no@@ dar : wom@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
in Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s was demolished in the first group of matches in the Europe League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the football @-@ Bundesliga in Du@@ el by the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t turn back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga @-@ top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its family eleven on the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ epers .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller adop@@ ts the space of regular b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the football teacher the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes into use in the future in all Europe @-@ League play , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
he will also contest the second game with a high probability .
the for@@ bear@@ ded statement of fellow player R@@ EU@@ s that the final statement for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the goal , maintains mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as well : &quot; that is Marco &apos;s not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to attack the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ cars : government wants to take leadership for Germany
Germany is said to be the Federal Government &apos;s will to change technological pioneers after the will of the German government .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to see a strategy of strategy from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Autom@@ at International Motor Show by a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
automated , connected driving will increase the traffic safety , and ensure less st@@ out , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the topic with his counterpart , the G7 states , which will also come together with representatives of the industry .
the Ministry of Strategic Affairs , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a generous support of digital audi@@ ot@@ el@@ ephone .
for testing new technology a test route is currently being established on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional port risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government will review the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 km / h .
the Federal Government also plans to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as a driver so far .
during automated driving , the car will be taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that detect the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , passenger vehicles can be expected to be expected in public roads as far as 2020 . &quot;
value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the high @-@ automated driving capabilities on the German site will estimate the authors of the study by 2025 on about 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic officer S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and safety of the personal data of the driver has to be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still seem skep@@ tical - much more than the French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA suspension of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the DE@@ K@@ RA survey is said that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will follow in the next ten years , 32 percent will not expect at all in 20 years that 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 , accounting for 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not willing to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital segment , only seven percent would agree to withdraw the control throughout all roads .
on the highway , there could still be 15 percent in flowing traffic , at a point 45 percent .
well , every person would leave control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says Team@@ - and Double start at table tennis @-@ EM
after present , the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight only in singles at the title of September 25 to October 4 .
final decision should fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo to bring the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ stra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the European course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this point at the time agreed on a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship of sponsor@@ ship in China at this time .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we &apos;re now no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who performs the her@@ ring list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , is also remin@@ ded of the EM 2013 in Schwe@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo made us , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ kings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has drawn a serious bre@@ ach on the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a en@@ f@@ ant .
it &apos;s a mixture of a big fashion show and a wat@@ cht@@ ower @-@ Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented a show on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying thanks to video projections .
they carry out the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and there@@ with that he put men in the skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say no more today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant in the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was light , meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown from September 18th at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude towards a show over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it sounded a bit like death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come into the Museum .
the stunning collection had already been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into which barely even looked at the man &apos;s work , written in fashion history , without having ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the vision is not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , which was operated for much effort , for example , to make the dolls , for example , a styl@@ ist was involved .
14 tons of material have incar@@ cer@@ ated the M@@ acher according to the Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot figures according to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October festival was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather pants out@@ fit with cor@@ dial .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are poor than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ gy mo@@ und Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him .
he then taught the dis@@ card of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , including Gaul@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own show , he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - p@@ aus@@ ed tip than fashion @-@ niche
in earlier , it went to the long silk machines in and around pl@@ ank therefore to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were developed in large amounts for customers , which , for example , worked for ceilings and yar@@ ns .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ ist@@ erous Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is again important .
in the initial times of pl@@ au@@ sp@@ ire , fashion played a larger role , then pushed through the home textiles industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt lists some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on past stit@@ ches , is an increasing volume potential .
who has no niche in the textile branch in Germany , is no longer available on the market .
with us , they are already half of all orders .
mo@@ dest@@ ress Pl@@ auen is together with nine other companies member of the industry association pl@@ ain@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can bear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of its sales are broken .
private trade transactions and the wholesale store are almost no longer available .
our products hardly ever reach our customers on this road .
the mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
moreover , we@@ aker are exp@@ orting , currently under Russia and to the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also attempting to score environmental awareness like Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ broi@@ der@@ le in Falk@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we carry out a quality seal that shows that we produce Ec@@ ological and Soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger outer shell of the West @-@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au , Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
it creates a voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which must remember mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design often varies only slightly , to keep a customer base .
a few years ago the textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ alizes the historic snow @-@ pointed tip .
in this way , the machine embroi@@ dered with some places of small ch@@ icks .
the pl@@ ain@@ ted gold smith master@@ ing in Bi@@ anca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ß had inspired him : &quot; before that I could not start with traditional plate . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ pointed tip for their jewelry .
in an elabor@@ ate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region recognize themselves with the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pl@@ ot@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies us in the United States , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings , and want to make a feel of commem@@ oration .
that &apos;s what I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be stirring , but Disney dar@@ es herself to a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie , but for a sort of continuation of the 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about experience of N@@ anny with the family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
if you &apos;re playing P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is un@@ clear .

XI ou@@ reth to open the economy , broad@@ ly wider for the world
the economy has to open its wider out@@ ward to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group that was commissioned with steering the reform .

EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and the consumers make a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organization , which is a corresponding working paper on the EU , critic@@ ised the plans sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects failed by industrial and environmental policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have raised the limits of the nerve po@@ ison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; raised by one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are so strongly polluted with mercury today , that are not allowed to be sold at the basis of the current limit of approximately 50 per cent of the length .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ mistak@@ able .
in exchange for this loos@@ ening the EU wants to reduce the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ ps are usually stressed as low as they already keep the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decrease in cl@@ eic acid is therefore &quot; an per@@ fi@@ ent movement man@@ oeu@@ ver that helps the business alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal , which is particularly sensitive to the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of the nervous system of the nervous system can cause problems &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs accounts on its website with regard to the applicable highest values , but that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury can be passed through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written report from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ra@@ z ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted .
the concentration of mercury in fish is approximately in El@@ be , Rhine , and Danube was &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March .
last year , mercury in fish contained in fish with the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
