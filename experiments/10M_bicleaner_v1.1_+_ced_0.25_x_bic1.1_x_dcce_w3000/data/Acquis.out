agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements regarding the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; requirements in the medium term financial crisis
the BI@@ Z could be stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , if the banks place an appropriate request .
the agreements could be closed until the total amount of accession to the stock market will be closed , namely within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future registration spl@@ af@@ on@@ ds of member countries .
even now , there are some conditions mentioned below , where the BI@@ Z application would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ Z would initially take over an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ing stocks , without the fact being crossed for a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as for their early extension the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening ceremony .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on trade with Hamm@@ ed@@ - and lamb meat

the community is obliged to meet all necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of in@@ fusion license is made dependent on the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina from the presentation of an export licence , which is referred to by the Argent@@ in@@ ean government .
the details for the application of this system will be determined , so that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the in@@ fusion licence for the questionable products can be wai@@ ved .
