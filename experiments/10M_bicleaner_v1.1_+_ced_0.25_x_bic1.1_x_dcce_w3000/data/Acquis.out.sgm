<seg id="1127">In the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argentine Republic on trade with Hammed- and lamb meat</seg>
<seg id="1128">I honour myself to discuss the recent negotiations between our delegations for the establishment of Hammed-, lamb and goat's meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community. in the course of these negotiations the two parties are classified as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1129">- fresh or cooled vegetable, lamb and goat meat (02.01 A IV a);</seg>
<seg id="1130">Under this agreement, the export opportunities for Hammed-, lamb and goat's meat was set by Argentina to the following annual amount: 20 000 tons, expressed in battle-weight (1).</seg>
<seg id="1131">In order to ensure a flawless operation of the agreement, Argentina is obliged to ensure the appropriate procedures that the fact that the estimated annual quantity not exceeds the agreed amount and is executed according to the conventional supply forms (frozen or cooled).</seg>
<seg id="1132">Should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible, the two parties of this agreement will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned above to find a proper solution.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the event that the community takes the protection clause, they pledged to bear to the fact that the community under this agreement is not touched by Argentina's approach to the common market.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the event that the natives from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts, the Community reserves the right to suspend the objection from Argentina for the rest of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1135">The community commits itself to restrict the added value from this agreement to a minimum set of 10 v.H. ad valorem.</seg>
<seg id="1136">During the admission of new Member States, the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number of 2 fixed amount according to the extent of the Argentinian trade with each new Member State.</seg>
<seg id="1137">The depletion for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Accession Treaty; on this occasion, the amount of added value is referred to under the number 5 mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The total number 2 of the total amount will be determined with the day of Greece to the community to 23 000 tons of battle-weight.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The Community undertakes everything to avoid a market development, which could affect the marketing of Argentine Hammed- and lamb on the common market within the agreed amount.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In particular, the Community takes precautions so that the paragraph of interventiveness is made of frozen flesh, due to the implementation of the Regulation of Argentinic Hammed- and lamb's meat.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Considering the objectives and provisions of this agreement, the Community agrees that any actual application of refunds or other funding measures for the export of Hammed- and lamb's meat and lambs are made only at prices and conditions which stand with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional portion of the community at the world trade with these products.</seg>
<seg id="1142">These terms are consistent in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of GATT, and in particular Articles 10 (2) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI, XVI and XXIII of the General inch and trade agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1143">Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement, in particular that the quantities of export licenses stated within this Agreement are granted under number 1 of the above mentioned products.</seg>
