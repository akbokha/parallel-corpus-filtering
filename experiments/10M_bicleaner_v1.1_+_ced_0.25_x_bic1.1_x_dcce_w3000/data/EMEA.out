it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets as a solution to capture ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. enter@@ res thinking and spre@@ aders , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things which are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ criptions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental condition where the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy will be used for the treatment of medi@@ severe he@@ avier episodes and the prevention of Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied to rapid control of disturbed anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
in both conditions the solution can be taken or the mel@@ ting tables in patients may be applied to those ra@@ ging of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as bili@@ fy fy , should be adjusted , the dosage should be adjusted from bili@@ fy fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as &quot; partial Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin from schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder carries a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , eliminating psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms , and their recur@@ rence will be prevented .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy that prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ector resolution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases , which compared to disturbed anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been re@@ treating for 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy fy .
the effectiveness of bili@@ fy inj@@ ector solution was found in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which were involved in disturbed anxiety , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the modification of the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies in order to investigate as the body absorbed the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to deposit .
in both studies with the inj@@ ecting solution , patients showed that bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly increased reduction of symptoms spread more un@@ disturbed than patients who received a placebo .
when applied to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , dis@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies have more effective than placebo .
bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks long more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence Man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms spread and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to capture ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ enz ( lack of movement ) , vom@@ iting ( tre@@ mor ) , vom@@ iting ( per@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting and exhaus@@ tion ( increased saliva production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bili@@ fy in treating schizophrenia and severe severe episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole spoke to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in fast control of disturbed anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the inclusion of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or com@@ bin@@ ational therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophrenia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ( 65 years ) has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower Initi@@ ald@@ osis should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Indu@@ s is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased su@@ icide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( myo@@ cardi@@ ac inf@@ ap@@ y or isch@@ a@@ emia diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ disp@@ ose ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ printing medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including aphrodisiac and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

if at one with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest to a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics have to be decreased , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are related to cr@@ amps , be used with caution .

there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the incentive for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents treated direct comparisons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of the deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar manager , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ ine , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the remn@@ ant rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered as clin@@ ically relevant .

it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ au@@ ctions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er@@ ers may result in the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration by Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans .
if one considering the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefits should over@@ l@@ ull the potential risks to the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ esters , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ au@@ ctions .
after abor@@ tion of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors the dosage should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y at the start of the esc@@ ort .
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses showed 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day not a significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ color@@ ant ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for the human being and due to the concerns in repression , this medicine must not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ises has no negative influence on it .
the following side effects were more common ( Acts 1 / 100 ) than on placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency shown below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophrenia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were treated , a total reduced incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) from EPS including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ onas , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , compared to patients treated with semi@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .

in the long @-@ term phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes occurred in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ or@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.@@ 0 % of the patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome include , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis and cr@@ amps , unwanted events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch have been un@@ inten@@ tionally or inten@@ tional prevalence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a h@@ acker in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; it is unlikely , however , that Hä@@ z@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefit , because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma rate .
it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophrenia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a particip@@ atory effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is conve@@ yed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a half @-@ operated survey , 52 percent of the Res@@ p@@ ous patients who taught a response to the study medication , in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ben@@ zene 77 % and Hal@@ di@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement instru@@ mentation , which were defined as secondary study programmes , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants - scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement as in holding i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction of rel@@ ent@@ rates that lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % on placebo .
in an ox @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients were involved and in which the primary study of weight loss ( N = 18 or 13 % of value @-@ value patients ) occurred at significantly less patients a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ o@@ therapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ o@@ therapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ und and actively @-@ controlled Mon@@ o@@ therapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo over @-@ le@@ ased effectiveness in week 3 and a entertaining effect , which was comparable to that of lithium or semi@@ conductors in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also referred to 12 a comparable portion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia on how lithium or semi@@ operated dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which , partly over 2 weeks do not appear on licensing or Val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic treatments , revealed the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

based on in vit@@ ro @-@ studies the enzy@@ mes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ulation is being cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle elimination period is approximately approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at approximately C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene , there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophrenia , no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a non @-@ specific evaluation of the drug co@@ ine@@ tics revealed not an indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceutical co@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Stret@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study at Pro@@ gangs with different eng@@ radi@@ ant liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Stret@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies for safety res@@ sing , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gases , reproduction , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for the can@@ o@@ genic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not recognize any particular threat to humans .
To@@ xi@@ k@@ ologically significant effects were observed merely with doses or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical use .
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent side kidney disease ( AU@@ C ) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 45 mg / kg / car@@ cin@@ oma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ times of the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended Maxim@@ ald@@ osis during the human being ) .
in addition , a Ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ al asis has been determined as a result of the curing of sul@@ ph@@ ati@@ tudes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from ape to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3@@ ly the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ triple of the recommended Maxim@@ ald@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was examined in a main study conducted at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all types or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el secre@@ tion drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients with my@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines received .
if one considers only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines .
it may also not be applied to patients who are breastfeeding , or before the beginning of the treatment low concentrations in the blood .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) noted that my@@ x@@ ane in patients whose first treatment was no longer an@@ gling , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicines and that it has to be given unlike other Pac@@ li@@ ax@@ el drugs with other medicines to decrease any side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the acquisition of Bio@@ Science Bio@@ science Limited by providing a licence for the marketing of my@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mono@@ therapy is indic@@ ative for the treatment of metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma in patients who have failed the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not shown for standard anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ing ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ia &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensor@@ ic therapy , the dose should be reduced in the following series to 220 mg / m2 .
with sensory neuro@@ pa@@ thy degree 3 is the treatment to break down until a improvement to degrees 1 or 2 is achieved , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dos@@ ages in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
there have been no studies conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of renal function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ certain@@ ties and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an album @-@ based nan@@ op@@ articles form@@ ulating by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and an symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
among patients should not be initiated any new x@@ ane @-@ treatment cycles , until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ number has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has increased the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ died number back to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver @-@ dys@@ functions ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x U@@ LN or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x U@@ LN ) should not be treated with my@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly defined cardi@@ ologist in context is not proven , cardi@@ ac incidents in the inde@@ xed patient collective is not uncommon , especially in patients with younger anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine @-@ treatment or underlying heart attack or lung disease .
if in patients after the gift of my@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ dic@@ s and contra@@ sting funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avoidable .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply during and up to 1 month after treatment with my@@ x@@ ane a reliable contrac@@ eption method .
male patients treated with my@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child is born .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment for a sperm archiving , because by therapy with my@@ x@@ ane , the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility consists .
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that may affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 .
neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was rapidly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ B &lt; 10 g / d@@ l ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with my@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ B &lt; 8 g / d@@ l ) .
in table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of my@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

the application of my@@ x@@ ane for metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ established studies and from 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in random@@ ised phase III study study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with my@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were used .
this multi @-@ centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma carried out every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in the form of sol@@ vent medi@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of my@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without Pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the trial , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general state ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ oses and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ a cells .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ ference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood levels , in which in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if prior to the procedure , a blood @-@ blood@@ shed is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with disease , for which the medicine is shown .
in case of patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , se@@ amed is inj@@ ected to a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ ors , provided that they have received adequate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who maintain a chemotherapy , the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin@@ os should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per Dec@@ il@@ iter at adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron lack is , and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients who have received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may be an an@@ a@@ emia due to a er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ inal lack or by the fact that the body is not sufficient to address the body &apos;s own Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used in operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in , that it enables them to build epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was referred to as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were placed either by se@@ amed or continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the variation of the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ aries between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of under the skin has been examined by those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients infected by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ aries were maintained by patients who have been converted to se@@ amed in the same measure as for those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ war@@ dly mig@@ rate headaches and con@@ fu@@ sions .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to make sure that this is triggered by any allergic reactions .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ ol@@ amed represents , will provide information for the medical staff in all Member States information , including information on the safety of the drug .

clinical trials have been observed an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular abnormalities ( ESA ) with a h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have not demonstrated any significant benefit , due to the gift of epo@@ chs , if the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ ed concentration is increased by the concentration of the acquisition and the avoidance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ der should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

according to present findings , by treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa by adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy , for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may have to trans@@ act ) .

the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ etine should be based on a beneficial risk of risk involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are envisaged for a larger electri@@ otic procedure , if possible , before starting the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater electrical orthop@@ edic surgery should have an adequate thy@@ roid prophy@@ la@@ xis , since they have an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that when treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ reach glo@@ ck@@ strap of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an elevated risk of post @-@ operative ism / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ chs did not proven that they improve overall survival in patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or less@@ ening the risk of tum@@ ours .

the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with er@@ y@@ thropo@@ et@@ ines .

survival and progression of progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treated patients and the patient @-@ patient patients .

overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and at controls .
there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ genic events in tum@@ our patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ en Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a tick @-@ glo@@ bin@@ ar under 13 g / d@@ l , since few patients with these characteristics were included in the check @-@ in data .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is applied for the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ tory risk ( bone mar@@ es ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a reduced animal break@@ age as in hind@@ sight ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the button , a disease changing the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days of treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should be given a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting in a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
administration of acet@@ am@@ in@@ op@@ ium or bu@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy for inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms in the three days after in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get allowed Ac@@ la@@ sta to be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , it was a part of the material material for Zom@@ eta to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
during the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had suffered an en@@ cro@@ achment on a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness , whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme which builds bone substance ) in the blood again or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of cycl@@ or@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medi@@ cam@@ ents ) has been reduced to 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those on placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients on placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to risk of kidney patients , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta pres@@ cribe the indications for physicians that apply Ac@@ la@@ sta to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as to use similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended by intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic aber@@ ration , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should Ac@@ la@@ sta be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta was observed a long R@@ emis@@ eline period in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic aber@@ ration , a initi@@ ald@@ osis is recommended by 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 instead of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta In@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occur within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by gift of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min . Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience is available for this patient &apos;s group .
older patients ( 3,@@ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , because data is missing and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because these patient population has limited clinical experience .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ a@@ emia is before the beginning of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary based hypo@@ cr@@ atic can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer patients , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be done before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate a dental examination with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental gri@@ ps , no data are at disposal whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ate is reduced to the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral sector .
the clinical assessment by the doctor &apos;s doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occur within the first three days of administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by gift of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of other serious side effect was reported by patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who were placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) .
very common ( ( 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( € 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( € 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted effects are listed in chart 1 .
kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , associated .
the change in cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( per year before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure , as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable to three years comparable between the activity and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with acet@@ one @-@ patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory experiments , the temporary we@@ as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic amount appropri@@ ated below the normal pregnancy range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent survey , the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an Initi@@ ate dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reaction After administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral region occasionally has been reported especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the oral sector ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including customs acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

a micro @-@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed at the patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to placebo an increase in bone frac@@ tures and the preservation of traditional bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( B@@ P@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced by 30 % after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the start @-@ value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the starting point after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the start @-@ value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirror have not been measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of the patients received a multi @-@ gl@@ aci@@ dic dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 but oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall performance was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the group compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the acet@@ one treatment compared to the placebo treatment the BM@@ D in total and Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als at all periods .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted over 24 months compared to placebo treatment at an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the total amount and around 4.3 % on the leg line .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and killed in 185 patients , the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures stood by 7.5 % at Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % at placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of acet@@ one related to the once weekly hub of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate referred to the percentage change in the steering wheel of BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .

an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs cleaning - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration on time ) .
a diminished Clear@@ ance from Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme materi@@ alized substances is unlikely because of customs acid in humans is not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed and because it is a watch@@ ful or no direct and / or irreversible , metabolism of inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

this results in the fact that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the customs acid .
as for heavy kidney disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ el Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , there are no statements possible for these population .

according to CH@@ MP directive for risk management systems for general practitioner , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted to the next &quot; Perio@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If any new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ y@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • In the inside of 60 days if an important milestone was reached ( for pharmaceutical / risk minim@@ ization ) . • In request of E@@ MEA .
Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the button .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially estrogen made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get is carried out the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is arranged in@@ ordered , which weak@@ ens bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by putting the bone structure back norm@@ alized , thereby creating a normal bone @-@ formation , thus giving the bone again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you take other medicines / apply or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are using medicines that is known to use the kidneys .
when applying Ac@@ la@@ sta , along with food and drink , you are worried that you take enough fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that will assist you from your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the quar@@ ry .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that will be given to you by your doctor or care staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may possibly need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can take Ac@@ la@@ sta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before ending the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta in case you are considering the completion of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please check your next doctor &apos;s doctor and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion appear very frequently to ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle , or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , Nes@@ sel@@ aus@@ al and angi@@ o@@ ö@@ dem ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue or in the throat ) has been reported .
tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if any of the listed side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you notice adverse reactions that are not listed in these usage information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C will not be exceeded .
in patients with one of recently , low @-@ trau@@ matic aber@@ ration is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the joints .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficient with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ine disease , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , to ensure at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with one of recently , low @-@ trau@@ matic aber@@ ration is recommended a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 but oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public , the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Council Regulation ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which assessed the studies conducted by the Committee for Human@@ ism ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
accounts are used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin diabetes ) . • It may be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) when met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug ) is not shown . • It may be applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it may additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest standard dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl vaccine or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl vaccine or ins@@ ulin may be maintained , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl vaccine or ins@@ ulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin is better to be used and the blood sugar levels decreases , causing type 2 diabetes better .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied ; in this , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl fuel , in addition they were either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
accounts led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced in applying the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from accounts to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl values at 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , where the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin were examined in 2@@ 89 patients , patients who recorded accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took extra placebo .
the most common side effects associated with accounts were visual defects , infections of the upper air@@ ways ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ a@@ es@@ thesia ( diminished sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
accounts cannot be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic ca@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that accounts are intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients when met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for marketing authorisation from accounts in the entire European Union .

Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with ins@@ ulin and in which met@@ form@@ ine is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients infected by the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. younger heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or oil , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ms , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardi@@ o@@ cular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output li@@ abilities ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror increases up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzy@@ mes are as soon as possible again control .
if a patient develops , which point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , Ober@@ bau@@ ch@@ ism and / or darker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mes to verify .
the decision whether the patient treatment is continued with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , should be guided to the presentation of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that may arise from li@@ posu@@ ction and in some cases is associated with a fluid re@@ tention .
as a consequence of a h@@ ull , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in the middle h@@ ul@@ um values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ ine ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ atology by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity , patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple compression therapy with ins@@ ulin pump , or as two @-@ time combin@@ ant therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market introduction was reported below the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , an occurrence or a deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ ms with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the in@@ gestion of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report about interference of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bon@@ net , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the compl@@ ain@@ ant incidence amoun@@ ted to 1.9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , met with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ k@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be taken ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ y@@ mon and met@@ form@@ ine .
interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ic contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tive inhibit@@ or are not expected .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ mo@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance and therefore reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for federal growth .
very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( of present data is not invaluable ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ ors and the break @-@ inde@@ xes of the lens , as they are observed also with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T att@@ achments occurred over the triple of the cap of the standard range frequently on like under placebo , but more rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ ine or sul@@ fon@@ yl .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.@@ 6 % higher than those of placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or w .
since the market introduction , it has rarely reported on cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , though , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
it became a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to frac@@ tures , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and about 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ atively medication @-@ treated groups .
over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
in taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and boo@@ sts the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose evaluation in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ o@@ therapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time up to the retro@@ fitting of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c 5.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control could be sustained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ized despite dre@@ ad@@ on@@ ati@@ cal optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin , random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .

the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ o@@ therapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type @-@ 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma @-@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ tic@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ in@@ levels .
compared with placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide diminished values were observed .
in a study about 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is not only the so@@ ber @-@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but improved also on the development of the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de absorption , both on an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as on the hepati@@ c tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .

after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is rapidly resor@@ bed , whereby the peak concentration on un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one generally reaches 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness of roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .

after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in humans the mark@@ er was mainly found in the case ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to man 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .

in the study after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ der , which indicated that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the pack@@ et age ) .
the Committee on Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the treatment of diabetes compared to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S distributed a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e throughout the European Union .

some patients , where hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occur following a change of animal in human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warnings of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less distinct or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
travelling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor , since such travel can lead to that ins@@ ulin must be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take care of possible interactions in the therapy and use his patients to be beneficial to other medicines .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for marketing authorisation of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin is mixed , first the quantity of ins@@ ulin must first be re@@ ar@@ ed , then the quantity of ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id is required for patients to be a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary for the first dosage or during the first weeks or months after conversion .
travelling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor , since such travel can lead to that ins@@ ulin must be used or taken at other times .

go to the following way to avoid the injection of air and ensure a correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep up Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the inj@@ ecting wet and l@@ apping a few times with the finger easily against the cartridge .
if air bub@@ bles are present , they will continue to hold above in the cartridge , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • Dur@@ ing the injections , press the button completely in ( figure C ) • Now it must drop out of the peak of the injections , a drop of ins@@ ulin .
• Set@@ ting the audi@@ ting folder again so on the finished pen , that the number 0 is opposite to the Do@@ si@@ er brand ( figure D ) • Check if the button kno@@ b fully expresses .
if the button is not able to move freely , ins@@ ulin is pushed out of the injections - 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the button moves to the outside while you rot@@ ate the audi@@ ting folder • The scale under the button ( print button ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Do you see the highest number you can see on the press button • add the two numbers to set the set dose • If you have set up a wrong dose , turn the final step forward or backwards until you have set the right number of units .
turn them up until the button kno@@ b fully down and you can feel a resistance then take the audi@@ t@@ folder and put them back in such a way that the 0 of the Do@@ si@@ cker brand is facing .
be careful not to press only during the injection at the press button • Ke@@ ep the button according to the injection , until the injections of the skin was drawn from the skin .
it may possibly be un@@ accurate • You can use any dose which is higher than the number of remaining in the cartridge remaining units • You can use the Rest@@ or@@ gen@@ sk@@ ala to estimate how much ins@@ ulin is still left , but you can not use it to adjust your dose or choose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients who have already prove signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or po@@ cht@@ k@@ notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater primitive cryst@@ allo@@ ys , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary bar still remains over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased once a day 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , you can still occur tox@@ ins ; therefore it is recommended that patients take at least during the first six months using aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines to prevent fatal accidents .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an transplan@@ tation as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of thre@@ es from various aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of once every day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary level in the blood was under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily occurred 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary level in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with cardi@@ ac treatment may also affect a hei@@ gh@@ tened risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary pi@@ eg@@ els in the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to pri@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ ations ( including one of the medical history known or current present Gi@@ cht@@ r@@ ens and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um har@@ p halls after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dosage can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in case of patients with severe kidney problems , the effectiveness and safety have not been fully examined ( Kre@@ atal Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people there are no experiences in children and young people , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ ts since it does not experience any experiences at Organ@@ iz@@ ers , the application of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease or de@@ fer@@ ous cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic medicines it can come to a acute toxicity in the treatment process , because by reducing the ser@@ um har@@ dro@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els , ur@@ inary adap@@ tations can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases tends to increase as widely that it comes to a storage in ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases during the clinical studies of phase 3 have been observed slight abnormalities of the liver @-@ functional patients with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform before the beginning of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ o treatment and further course depending on clinical results , a liver disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ ones were no in@@ effective studies to Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ p can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( an im@@ itation of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) .

in a study involving subjects of 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a medium 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ or effect of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a supplement containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ id ( about 1 hour ) delays and a decrease in the c@@ max by 32 % , however no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ elled pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be ruled on side effects of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at for the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / newborn baby .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be war@@ y when using a vehicle , use of machines or in the practice of dangerous activities , until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC influences their performance dis@@ advantageous .

placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg / d@@ l or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ mentally worth studying &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed by 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed at least 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um arthritis ( 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of ser@@ um har@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in a week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mentally &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney problems The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney problems ( D ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in case of the percentage of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration at Pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal renal function , and 55 % in the group with severe kidney functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration amounts to 10 mg / d@@ l about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ eline , and F@@ act ) had a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration of € 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected within two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of the patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a g@@ gling ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required not treatment against a toxicity ) .
this was associated with a reduction of tox@@ ins size , resulting in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the tox@@ ins to the month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ hable increase .
after intake simpler or more multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in percentage decline of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ acid concentration , provided that this has been checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution : apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ le Bind@@ ing of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Albu@@ min ) and is via the concentration @-@ wide that is achieved with cans of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vit@@ ro @-@ studies in human micro@@ scopy indicated that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ atter cur@@ on@@ id is primarily created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found itself as an un@@ altered Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ actic cur@@ on@@ id of the drug ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and its Kon@@ it@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other un@@ familiar Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency changed the C@@ max of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate in proportion to Pro@@ ban@@ den with normal renal function .
the middle total AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate rose to about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ . w / ml in the group with regular renal function to 13.@@ 2 μ g , h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ tion other medicines ( including pine@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid an irritation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not take up until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to identify the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D @-@ mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D @-@ mirror was treated with the patients infected with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who captured only Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data in mind that included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats as abdom@@ inal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( ra@@ ging ) , pe@@ as ab@@ dom@@ es ( pu@@ ffed stomach ) as well as acid rep@@ lic@@ t .
in patients with et@@ ain@@ less hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or inser@@ tion of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and Vitam@@ ins ) for the day .
the following hints have to be followed precisely in order to decrease the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must be swal@@ lowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) because a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a exists . • The patients should not take place before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as eco @-@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , Kos@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al membrane lesi@@ ons , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some of them were severe and required an ambul@@ ance instruction ) .
the doctor is therefore aware of attention to any signs and symptoms that may point out to possible solution , and patients should be pointed out , at the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , pain in lo@@ cking or retro@@ static pain , or new or so@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine to pick up and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy ho@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine correctly and / or point it according to the appearance of symptoms that point to a ös@@ ch irritation .
it is very important that all instruc@@ tors are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the breakdown of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ry in patients who need a ortho@@ don@@ surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose by the j@@ aw .
the clinical assessment by the treating doctor is authorit@@ ative for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ant to be reli@@ eved of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they noticed their om@@ is@@ ance .
you should not take two tablets a day , but intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( like vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the beginning of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines can interfere with the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ tional studies have not been conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy still from nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly fo@@ al effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post @-@ natural development .

the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transp@@ l@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining example , how often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , recent studies have been carried out on 119 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transp@@ l@@ ant and studied how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should re@@ arrange this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
because of clinical @-@ relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transp@@ l@@ apping or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or excessive immun@@ isation .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic procedure must be performed for monitoring and relevant dosage adjustment to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood @-@ regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ ens should be controlled in front of the switch and over two weeks after switching .
on Day 4 the systemic exposure was measured , measured as a level of level , with both form@@ ulations for both kidney and le@@ ased patients .
careful and repeti@@ tive checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ ens are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ math stage .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State reaches .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow or@@ ale intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentration for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca .
duration of application Z@@ ur suppression of transplan@@ tation must be sustained as immun@@ os@@ up@@ lifting ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified .

additional dos@@ ages may be required later because the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transp@@ l@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ osition The or@@ ale Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be a transplan@@ tation of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so that switching in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to as the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant after switching from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily must start treatment with each in kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant initi@@ ald@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transp@@ l@@ ant for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once daily .
other Tran@@ splan@@ tation Rec@@ ei@@ vers , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pan@@ de@@ - and den@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , came in early initi@@ ate patients in a or@@ al initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in a or@@ al initiation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day to use .
Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ts in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintaining blood pressure in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver @-@ dys@@ functions a reduction of dose .
patients with reduced kidney function There the renal function exercises no influence on the pharmaceuticals of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the renal function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um incre@@ mental levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ability and monitoring of the ureth@@ ra ) recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the switch from an Cic@@ los@@ por@@ to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the profile in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual case under way of comp@@ utation of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us controls .
it is recommended frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us rock levels during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood pressure level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be checked for switching from pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the same application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us enforcement @-@ bleeding ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments in the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the slow@@ down level in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lie in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time following liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and pun@@ ched patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent investig@@ ating therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts have generally been used blood @-@ concentration in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including transp@@ l@@ apping or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ tation burdens that proved to be consistent with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as re@@ frac@@ tory , are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of advoc@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .

because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal compounds ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant healing during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ tics concentrations in the blood is being offered to the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances may be substantial fluctu@@ ations .
in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia signed chamber or Sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such sound@@ ing disorders , are an already existing heart @-@ suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorder , infections , fluid degradation and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or using a solar protection factor with a high protection factor .
if patients need to take the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us symptoms for Pr@@ es like headaches , changed conscious state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual defects , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ ose , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is included in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ant , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as the inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus decrease the blood@@ stream from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
it therefore recommends to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the current gift of substances that may change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and set the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even@@ ly concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .

pharmac@@ o@@ k@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly comes from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism , results .
high@@ do@@ si@@ ated pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ li@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute rep@@ lic@@ tive actions , the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower in the blood .

because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us comp@@ el the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus to increase hormonal exposure is very careful in decisions regarding recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal trials showed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ value .
the results of a small number of examinations at transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that in Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there is increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditional , con@@ genital blood disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application are directed to whether Adv@@ oc@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII shortage , causing blood pressure problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method that is called a &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell , in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ate is a different member of the European Union named Re@@ al@@ ates , similar , but is otherwise made , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug has been studied in the prevention of bleeding and surgical interventions .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was assessed in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ iso@@ ds with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to provide approval for the marketing of Adv@@ oc@@ ate throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII man@@ ag@@ m , according to the place and extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ of events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not decline to the specified plasma bars ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeating until the risk to the patient is over .
during the treatment course , the dose is advised to control the dose and the frequency of injections , an adequate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plasma bars .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis use of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should cans between 20 and 40 percent of factor VIII per kilo@@ gram of body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII is not to be achieved , or if the bleeding with a reasonable dose is not ruled out , a test must be carried out in order to assign an inc@@ bit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be weigh@@ ed .
the deadline @-@ speed is to be directed after the patient &apos;s death , whereby the maximum injection of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of Neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator activity by factor VIII reveals Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that can be quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma via modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ relate with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ posi@@ days is the largest and dependent on genetically and other factors .
in response to patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positioning and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ emergence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare appearance of the ha@@ mop@@ hi@@ lie A at women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients with inhibit@@ ors were inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all associated with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very common ( commit 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( € 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be invaluable ) .

the immune response of patients in traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed through the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side @-@ effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise no signs or symptoms appear to be referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients it became ar@@ du@@ ed over the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es with multiple repeti@@ tive product positions in the context of the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to be assessed as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety test of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the marketing owner should apply another renewal procedure for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee of Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company has reg@@ ained its application for approval by Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues that connect the other structures in the body , surrounds and base ) .
it is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it may carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that was changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in humans .
advoc@@ acy should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed by the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , contributes normally to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the canc@@ erous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , in the bones and in the brain .
once the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked to him , some questions were un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP on day 120 created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to CH@@ MP , not enough proved that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will bring benefits to the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient is harmful .
the company wasn &apos;t aware of the CH@@ MP opinion whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical studies or &quot; com@@ end use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed &apos; delay &apos; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly released over several hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , by an allergy to pol@@ len , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al sli@@ ces ( pet@@ ri@@ fter nose ) .
for adults and young adults aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet daily with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um ( pet@@ ted nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug use the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effect could be the changes of the severity of the hay fever , reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients received their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a default sk@@ ala as difficult as the symptoms in the last 12 hours were .
in consideration of all ha@@ ke@@ able symptoms besides the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported on a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5,@@ 9 % in patients who captured pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the swelling of the nose @-@ endom@@ etri@@ um was considered , the patients under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar@@ ming ( cardi@@ tis ) , swelling , head@@ ache , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , ob@@ struction , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or wre@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not to be used .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ a ( over@@ flow of the thy@@ roid ) or have had a risk for a here@@ of stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of SP Europe divided a licence for the marketing of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , is however swal@@ low in the whole ( that is , without having to cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after exp@@ ir@@ ation of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the use of application for 10 days , since long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ats can decrease in time .
after decl@@ ining the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
because aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , hydr@@ o @-@ dop@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ in , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , oxid@@ ants , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to pronoun@@ ce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about the treatment with the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ der or from Pal@@ ast@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches ) must decrease .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a myo@@ cardi@@ ac inf@@ g in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ fitting in the am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing gender @-@ based tests because anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin transactions or reduce their scale .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or test could not be any significant differences between the patients treated with DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether it was taken by lor@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or with alcohol .
the enzyme required for the metabolic ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins .
the un@@ thin@@ kable use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not backed up , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of abnormalities associated with frequency of normal population .
because reproduction studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ ic properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it in very rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases to lead to a impair@@ ment of transportation or ability to use machines .
the symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , less@@ ened mental attention , comb@@ o , cardiovascular collision ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .
headaches , anxiety , frigh@@ tening injury , muscular weakness and increased muscle strain , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arousal , breathing failure , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , ton@@ ality , visual impair@@ ment and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely , as well as ather@@ trop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ pul@@ sion cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ al cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ rot@@ ary cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective r@@ ami@@ fications , or the tasks connected with flying .
controlled clinical trials has been determined by recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , an em@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arousal .
there were 1,@@ 2@@ 48 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , where 4@@ 14 patients were Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall condition for symptoms ( except nas@@ al sli@@ ppers ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseudo ep@@ he@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets in view of the dimin@@ ishing effect , determined by the nas@@ al sli@@ der swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study for the drug co@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy pro@@ ban@@ den over 14 days the flow of weight loss of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ath was reached in day 10 .
as part of a phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which has been performed with the formulation as tablets of healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ den , was found that four trials of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly damaged .
a component Inter@@ ac@@ tional study reveals that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine according to the only gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of a aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pill .
based on conventional studies for safety res@@ sing , for toxicity in repeat@@ ability , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not allow special dangers to humans .
the combination co @-@ owned no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine .
in reproductive @-@ reproductive studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ ine was in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in young people aged 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the existing disease process and can be termin@@ ated after the sound of the symptoms and resum@@ ed at their re @-@ encounter .
in the pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy period a lasting treatment .
clinical @-@ relevant interactions have not been determined within the scope of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the current intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not been reinforced at the simultaneous effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it that in very rare cases it can come to ben@@ om@@ eness , which may lead to a impair@@ ment of transportation or the ability to use machines .
in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently raised side effects reported about which was more common than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side effect head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the im@@ itation of the release of pro@@ pul@@ sion cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ al cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ or of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ Sel@@ ek@@ tin on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical trial involving multi @-@ subject matter , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been administered for over ten days per day ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of the clinical dose ) has been administered for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
at a single dose - study with adults showed DES@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective r@@ ami@@ fications , or the tasks connected with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of nose , it@@ ch , tre@@ ach@@ ings and redness of the eyes , as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ists allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall level of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tica , A@@ eri@@ us effectively diminished the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ physiological path@@ ology despite the e@@ ti@@ ology in the different forms are similar and chronic patients can be simpler pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine release is a decisive factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not re@@ acted to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , excluded from the study .
an improvement in the blood pressure by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with as@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growing , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variable .
in a pharmac@@ o@@ k@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s -@@ Pop@@ ulation , was reached in 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant grief after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , it has not been identified for the metabol@@ ites of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme however , so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
which demonstrated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , at a comparable degree of exposure of disaster at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualit@@ atively or quanti@@ t@@ ative differences in regard to the toxicity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies for safety res@@ sing , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gases , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity of the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ otrop@@ in no special dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms at allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with as@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis should play a role in diagnosis , physical studies and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolism , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine reduced and experience higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see below Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years of age , restricted to the extent , is identical to those with children , which metabol@@ ise normal metabolism .
this drug contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ant , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose de@@ hydr@@ ation or a Sac@@ char@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine does not take .
clinical @-@ relevant interactions have not been determined within the scope of clinical trials with axi@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the current intake of as@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not been reinforced by the efficient effect of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the placebo group .
in clinical studies involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ multi @-@ dose study of adults and young people , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years , which were asked for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy comprising 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy issue of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be manipul@@ ated in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial involving multi @-@ professional users of adults and adolescents , applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , applied in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ ary of the clinical dose ) has been applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls .
controlled clinical trials has been determined by recommended dosage 5 mg daily for adults and juven@@ iles , no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to any impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or in clinical studies .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , it came up by the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a rein@@ forcement of alcohol @-@ induced power com@@ promised or increasing the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ch of nose , it@@ ch , tre@@ ach@@ ings and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the overall level of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduces the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dose .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s &apos;s Vacc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed to the Committee of Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company has reg@@ ained its application for authorisation from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied by adults and elderly people to protect flu , caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus emerges , which can easily spread from human to human beings , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will be able to form faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
then , the membrane id of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m surface , which recognizes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) separated and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this resulted in the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA for prepar@@ ative vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .
if you require further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with human immuno@@ deficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which is inf@@ lic@@ ated by the acquired immuno@@ deficiency ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ ci@@ ase is not available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the security of this combination was not investigated .
axi@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral medicines of the patient has previously taken , and the probability has assessed the virus to address the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice a day of 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of am@@ a@@ ase is based on the body weight .
axi@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level .
AIDS does not cure , however , can delay the immune system and thus delay the development of with AIDS related infections and diseases .
axi@@ as was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with a prot@@ esters .
that with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r drugs A@@ ci@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , who had previously taken in the prot@@ esters , with other prot@@ esters .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change in the virus after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously taken no prot@@ esters , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than below placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , aging A@@ sc@@ are also caused the Vir@@ al last but with the children who were treated earlier with prot@@ esters , very few in the treatment languages .
in the study with adults , which had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , this with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r boo@@ sts , the Vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ week treatment were as effective as other prot@@ esters :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ esters , it came under ather@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ al last after four weeks as in patients who continued to advance their previous prot@@ esters :
the most common side effects of ather@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea ( nausea ) , nau@@ tical ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and the Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ ci@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
axi@@ ase may also not be applied to patients who are cur@@ ated ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines that are just as ather@@ ase or are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the risk of cereb@@ ro@@ d@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( die of bone tissue ) or an immuno@@ deficiency syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of a infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
axi@@ ase is usually taken together with the phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fier , but the Committee noted that the use of aging in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ esters , is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as at the time the approval was limited for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group to generate a licence for the marketing of gener@@ als throughout the European Union .
axi@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ esters ( PI ) , and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ st@@ ation of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r should be done in consideration of the individual viral her@@ g@@ sters and the patient treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ e is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 600 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ sc@@ are capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ks@@ ing ) , higher doses must be applied to axi@@ as ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg am@@ kled / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceutical , effectiveness and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ esters were not examined in children .
aging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data to in@@ conceivable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ o@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to am@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver @-@ dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be made with caution in patients with mild or more liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
axi@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ame 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations that included cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) must not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma @-@ con@@ centric and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aging does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , aging capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients infected with chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral compression therapy , have increased risk of heavy liver damage effects with potentially fatal course .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active Hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver @-@ dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral compression therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of axi@@ as and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ e@@ or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , which over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ i , and sup@@ pressing the renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous arrangement of ather@@ atin with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of myo@@ path@@ ia , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen not recommended .
4 For several medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and warnings ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug Con@@ centr@@ ation are available .
in patients who are taking these drugs at the same time , am@@ a@@ ase may be less effective for decreased plasma bars of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r may be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ less symptoms , especially if it is also used for low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of toxicity to be toxicity due to the high prop@@ agate content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution at certain other patients .
axi@@ ase should be set on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ esters , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , their therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
a mop@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) who were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous @-@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
with HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective patients may develop a inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual infection that leads to serious clinical trials or degradation of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Equ@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune system , higher Body measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral compression therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ ci@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ sc@@ are with chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with pharmaceuticals , whose agents are mainly transmitted over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma bars with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a res@@ abo@@ o development .
in the attempt to detect the lowest plasma bars through a dosage increased from other protein @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very often unwanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient occupies already cur@@ ated , the spec@@ kled mirror , and , if possible to check the Vir@@ al last and avoid the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % lower when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with lime ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered .
a do@@ dging for the simultaneous administration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and calcium can not be given , but it is recommended , however , a nar@@ row@@ ly monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
there has been no phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with diver@@ gence , but is recommended due to the anta@@ sia component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ generative ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protests would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ on to other prot@@ esters and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ on may sun@@ k into the ser@@ um con@@ centric of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is needed together with as@@ am@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ o@@ k@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ generations in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , however , the plasma @-@ bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily m@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day at 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ 61 compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ kled with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with aging effects , may result in interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines , when they are applied in combination with aging .
based on the data of other prot@@ esters , it is advisable that ant@@ acids may not be taken at the same time as ather@@ ase , as it may come to res@@ or@@ tic disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ volcan@@ ic antidepress@@ ants known as en@@ act@@ ants ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma bars of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ low pin , ni@@ ckel @-@ pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake with as@@ yn@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration , and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of as@@ generations with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced reduction in plastic containers at the same administration of am@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma @-@ mask increases this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to myo@@ path@@ ia , including a R@@ ul@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it will be recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us at the same gift of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r can be increased ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while at the same use of as@@ generations with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am caution .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ esters , indicate a possible increase in the plasma bars of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ at@@ ent@@ less symptoms , especially if it is also used for low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the low reliability of historical comparisons , no recommendation can currently be given as the am@@ a@@ avi@@ r@@ x dose is to custom@@ ize when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time using meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with axi@@ as , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not fores@@ ee@@ able , so also alternative methods are recommended to contrac@@ eption methods .
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example , des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the con@@ federation of am@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful clear@@ ance of possible usage for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated rats , am@@ a@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people to the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study of bear@@ ded rats , which was administered from in@@ dem@@ nific@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ tility and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the mother tier .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ ci@@ ase was examined in adults and children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side @-@ related side effects were light up to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment course .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are applied in connection with the intake of in@@ generative or other at the same time to the HIV treatment applied or whether they are a result of the disease .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for analy@@ zing the results of reset tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic proof @-@ based analyses Klin@@ ic vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the ab@@ estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants and res@@ istent isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a decreased sensi@@ tiveness against am@@ a@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain Crus@@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data on the Crus@@ ade between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ino@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ad@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ kled patients , with which a Fos@@ am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ et@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , in@@ et@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , seed avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ate ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ate ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ esters of prot@@ ections ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a rejuven@@ ating therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may affect the following treatment .
the test@@ ament to the effectiveness of as@@ generations in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial , in which with PI sub@@ du@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with low @-@ fired Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ thre@@ es ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ war@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ per@@ ple@@ xity of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI Group in the plasma after 16 weeks fixed , in a non @-@ sub@@ version of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were dealt with .
in the studies A@@ war@@ ase solution was used for inser@@ tion and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ known Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received a ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with aging .
after 48 weeks , roughly 25 % of the patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration amounts to the average duration ( t@@ max ) to maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increase , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attributed to a large distribution volume , as well as an in@@ consequ@@ ential penetration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ brid@@ ge@@ y Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ geable Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components during the period of automation in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bits or become a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with aging ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of sub @-@ gases capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r exposure to adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
spec@@ kled is less bio@@ compatible from the solution 14 % less bio@@ compatible from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generative solution and A@@ generative capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram .
also the ren@@ aissance Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a renal function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ a@@ avi@@ r plasma @-@ mask comparable to those who are scored by healthy pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred among male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses , containing the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , spoke .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet elu@@ sive and the relevance of these observed effects on the human being is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical rel@@ ev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ence tests , the bacterial @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test were included in human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic can be observed and proven in clinical use by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver toxic to patients , neither during the administration of aging , nor after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , both at the check@@ ups and the treated animals indicated a high mortality rate .
in a systemic plasma Ex@@ pos@@ ure , which was significant below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage at humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ sc@@ are capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ks@@ ing ) , higher doses must be applied to axi@@ as ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg am@@ kled / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with watch@@ ful or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and warnings ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation Rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug Con@@ centr@@ ation are available .
gener@@ ase should be decreased in length 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk of a li@@ pod@@ stream@@ line has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a res@@ abo@@ o development .
5@@ 08 % increases , for C@@ max by 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached in combination of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with lime ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily administered .
a do@@ dging for the simultaneous administration of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and calcium can not be given , but it is recommended , however , a nar@@ row@@ ly monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both protests would be low .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made since an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is needed together with as@@ am@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ den@@ pin , ni@@ ckel @-@ pin , ni@@ ckel @-@ pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin , ni@@ ckel pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significantly increased , while the endo@@ genous Kor@@ ti@@ so@@ l increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ Kon@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with axi@@ as , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ genic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or w .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful clear@@ ance of possible usage for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study of bear@@ ded rats , which was administered from in@@ dem@@ nific@@ ation into the uter@@ us by the end of lac@@ tation Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a diminished increase in the body weight by the offspring .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ ci@@ ase was examined in adults and children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of an over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supportive policies .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ esters of prot@@ ections ; the conservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation with PI @-@ treated children of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ using . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ brid@@ geable Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of free active components during the period of automation in the Ste@@ ady State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..

also the ren@@ aissance Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a renal function is likely to be low to the elimination of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ a@@ avi@@ r to mice and rats occurred among male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses taken to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to man after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ oma were not yet elu@@ sive and the relevance of these observed effects on the human being is unclear .
however , out of the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , there is little evidence of the adoption of a clinical rel@@ ev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ence tests , the bacterial infection test , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test of rats and chromos@@ omes test test , micro@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from an age of 4 days , both at the check@@ ups and the treated animals indicated a high mortality rate .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ sc@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ esters ( PI ) , and children aged 4 years and older .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of the patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ ci@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was neither occupied with PI @-@ treated patients yet with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ a@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inhal@@ e is 14 % less than capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to stop smoking ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for aging is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since there is no dosage recommendations for the simultaneous use of as@@ re@@ ase solution to capture and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patients is avoided .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ a@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for necessary is an application of am@@ generative solution to inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic response as a result of the high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ lar , as@@ am@@ ase solution for sett@@ ling children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ or of the metabol@@ isation of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aging does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and warnings ( under supervision of the International Stand@@ ardis@@ ation rati@@ o ) , methods for determining the drug Con@@ centr@@ ation are available .

very common side @-@ effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen bags ( a measurement of pneum@@ onia ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and bulk soli@@ ds .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me must be used in patients who may be greatly over@@ har@@ dy ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to verify all new information , which may be known , and will be able to update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who have Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to observe the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cells ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is available for long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the condition ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient contributes to it every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients there is no guarantee scheme to be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined , and for these patients there can be no problem scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions which are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the inc@@ umbent on ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be ti@@ ghter , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical setting , available immediately for medical emergen@@ cies .
because of the clinical Phase 3 study , we expect nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase typically form within 3 months from the date of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion reaction must be treated with caution in the use of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience dealing with the res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically risk of excessive risk of treatment must be cautious after a interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to deal with minim@@ ise the potential of in@@ fusion @-@ driven reactions .
in case of an easy or medium @-@ sized in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be stopped in@@ fusion , until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ o@@ be@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is tested .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .
3 become ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the pre @-@ established reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is made .
animal experimental studies do not let direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ natural development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there were no data on new@@ bor@@ ns who were exp@@ elled from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to not satisfy the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the effects in clinical studies have been arranged mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions which were observed at 53 % of the patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its pro@@ long@@ ation at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very common ( Revelation 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history occurred also severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory still@@ ness and facial wrin@@ kles ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children inf@@ ant drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe reduction and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a ser@@ oid version , whereby it occurred among patients under the age of 5 with a serious slow@@ ing form mostly within one month ( average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) were reported at 13 / 45 patients not by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lan@@ tis@@ ation ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies , among which 3 patients , in which it has never been to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with lack of antibody levels received a robust decrease in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutrality of inhibit@@ ors to the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , even though the appearance of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the justification for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ella @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study conducted at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients exp@@ elled from the mean phen@@ otype and only a patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ ches .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label survey , where they got another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , compared to the placebo group , an improvement of the lung function and the sal@@ vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
during the open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as well as out of the following table .
the decrease of the commen@@ cement of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung @-@ volum@@ ina is increasing further proportional to the height of grown @-@ grown children .
from the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly surgery we reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was found that remained constant up until the degree of study .
regarding the hetero@@ genic disease , between patients being considered by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant change has been summar@@ ised for five efficacy approval ( in 6 @-@ minute walking test , movement area of Schul@@ ter@@ gel@@ ks AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmac@@ k@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy sk@@ ating shape and 4 with medium size form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size of growth was found ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 years ) and all 4 patients with moderate pl@@ ating form were a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe waste form were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ genic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ me@@ ander schem@@ ata were performed at the G@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute wal@@ k@@ test .
intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
intraven@@ ous scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be found in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ orization schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is updated .
pharmac@@ o@@ ko@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on the safety of safety , toxicity , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gases and Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular threat to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet been eliminated by surgery ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily affect other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens , as well as some treatment .
to reduce side effects , patients should take care of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition an &quot; anti @-@ anti @-@ drug &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood screen changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postponed , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to pump in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and for a longer period of time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ ur@@ am@@ oth@@ á@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their condition .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived by an average of 12.@@ 1 month , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in case of some administration of c@@ ann@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies patients , however , patients with which cancer is not the plate @-@ epith@@ eli@@ um cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle has to be applied with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % of sodium injections ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding amount of the necessary do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the average bottle and with 0.@@ 9 % of sodium hydro@@ chlor@@ ine injections ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al epith@@ eli@@ om except during excessive pl@@ ating epith@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated in the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ d@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al @-@ based chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of ho@@ actions it must be given a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift and the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be taken at least 5 doses and intake must be continued during the whole treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pick @-@ pipe dose .
patients must also be an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients who received p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , prior to every gift , a complete blood @-@ image should be created , including the differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic enumer@@ ation .
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage can take place under Ber@@ si@@ vity by the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting therapeutic cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity to develop ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted , until the patient gets the value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues with the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 Jah@@ ve@@ - or compared to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk of risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non @-@ sufficient data for un@@ certain@@ ties and effectiveness .
clinical trials were needed in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from € 45 ml / min . no dosage adap@@ tations necessary to go beyond the dosage adap@@ ts for all patients recommended Dos@@ age .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance from below 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients with liver disease limits from &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - mar@@ ginal value and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; the above @-@ times of the upper limit value ( at case of liver fluctu@@ ations ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metastatic breast ) is not examined specifically in studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the button of the button and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ gue increases once again a value of the 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ died once again achieved a value of EUR 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage @-@ reduction for further cycles based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutrality of neutrality , th@@ rot@@ ism and maxim@@ al non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity , as observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 spher@@ ical and non @-@ curing toxicity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ yed when a pre @-@ treatment with fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ed with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduce stress @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g per day ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s have to avoid treatment for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , appropriate risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ inage of the ergometer will be weigh@@ ed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including myo@@ car@@ dium , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this drug is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of glu@@ ed vaccines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irreversible damage trig@@ gering , the reproductive capacity is made by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment of treatment , consult with regard to the spar@@ ing conservation .
in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high doses ( 1,4 g a day ) to a decreased sequ@@ el ex@@ cre@@ tion with a result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ei@@ c acid in high doses .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time as pic@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ di@@ b , the simultaneous application has to be fixed at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the patient status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardization : rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient , with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ ub@@ ol@@ ites are expected during an application in pregnancy serious birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely prompt , and after careful clear@@ ance of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment start , advising on the sper@@ mac@@ ular preserv@@ ative .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed over the mother &apos;s milk passes and unwanted effects upon the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om and random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and pl@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed vom@@ it as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin received as mon@@ otherapy .

patients who are taking care of All@@ i and after 12 weeks do not have a weight loss , should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzy@@ mes are inhi@@ bited , they may not disman@@ tle some fats in the diet , thereby resulting in about a quarter that has led to the nutrition caused by nutrition .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of increased 28 kg / m2 , patients who participated in the All@@ i 60 mg after one year saw an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .

alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ( 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fatty diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alli is not to be applied by children and young people under 18 , as not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the list@@ at however is only minimal resor@@ bed , is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or renal function no adaptation of dosage required .

the probability of occurrence of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if alli is taken together with a low @-@ fat single @-@ meal or fat @-@ rich nutrition .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes , before the beginning of a therapy with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take care as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures to prevent this in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the or@@ ical contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .

the side @-@ side effects of the list@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were identified from clinical studies with or@@ der@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .

Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy regim@@ en , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group is not enough information .
this means that the ingredient prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chemotherapy regim@@ ens , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chemotherapy regim@@ ents , which were strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi were not vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
chemotherapy regim@@ ents , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are showed 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi during 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
if a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on lay these values in 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids due to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can extend the col@@ lu@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty arrangement or signs of a sub@@ marine id@@ le after the injection @-@ tail .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ - interval is extended or which tend to have such an extension .
except in connection with other chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents , Alo@@ xi is supposed to be used neither for prevention nor for treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ otic agents , counter @-@ oriented activity of the five examined chemotherapy agents , not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical trial , there were no significant phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ otic tron and a Ste@@ ady ste@@ alth concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based on a population based phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous Gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Ami@@ pro@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , semi@@ ox@@ etine , mar@@ ox@@ etine , mar@@ in@@ ca@@ ine , ser@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ osis tron .
experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side effects ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly stood with alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions to the administration of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events such as in the other do@@ ons groups ; there were no dose of drug relations to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably no effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , representing a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) were given on Day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with increased 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ ann@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , were given by patients who were given 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
clinical trials for indications in chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and dol@@ ph@@ etr@@ on comparable .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the iter@@ ation and re@@ pol@@ arization of the I@@ onian channels and extend the duration of the shareholder to prolong .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces carried out was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of I.@@ B.@@ V. in individual d@@ osen from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gases follows an initial lowering of the plasma @-@ con@@ centric , a slow elimination from the body with an average temperature interval of about 40 hours .
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration Peri@@ od ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally available in the whole dosage area of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg with gest@@ ing and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ hable .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , which was measured at 11 Ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ osis @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ k@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ otic Flo@@ wers rises to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , with which according to a intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration ; however , the C@@ max was higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are transformed into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites which have compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron above less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso@@ enzy@@ mes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic agents made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous stu@@ d injection , the total body extension was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while in patients with severe liver disease the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ ulation and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ otic tron increases , a reduction of the dose is thus not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can block solely in very high concentrations of I@@ onian channels which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( every dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to men ) who were given daily over two years led to a increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ atic ) and skin tum@@ ours at rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi are determined in a unique application , the relevance of these results will be low as to the human being .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative review , in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C has been approved for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on a biological drugs called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble an effective component to the same general practitioner , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refer@@ ences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for treating adult patients with chronic ( long persistent ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection ) .

it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that allows them to build the drug .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on placed data that occupy the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active material composition , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference rate by 4@@ 55 patients .

the number of patients with hepatitis C , treated in the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
following the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease coinci@@ ded with more patients than with the reference rate ; moreover , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .

it can be applied for the treatment of im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( r@@ iss@@ or or chi@@ f@@ aded ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and gen@@ se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections , which were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ ass@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against these kinds of infections may not appear .
Al@@ tar@@ go may be applied for patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the surface .
if the patient does not appeal to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should consider the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial fl@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacteria , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was rep@@ lic@@ ated after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients responded to the treatment .
during the treatment of infected ho@@ tw@@ ins of Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar views : if the results of both studies have been combined with Hau@@ tw@@ ins , about 90 % of the patients from both groups were treated to treatment .
in these two studies , however , was found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( whi@@ pped @-@ filled cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or of infections , which were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the order .
the Committee for Human Rights Reser@@ vation ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go weigh against the risks of the following superficial skin infections across the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ filtr@@ ated small in@@ fi@@ bers , de@@ preci@@ ation or gen@@ se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
the patients , in which two or three days does not show improvement , are to be investigated once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in case of raising or serious local irritation through the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine the treatment is broken off , the sal@@ ine carefully dra@@ ined and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is supposed to be ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary sexual wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was the efficacy of ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin res@@ istent pile hybrid hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in@@ sufficiently .
an alternative treatment should be considered when after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or degradation of the infected one comes into consideration .
the impact of the simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
because of the small Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which were reached in human subjects upon topical skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation can not be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After constant gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine on ch@@ opped skin from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ts are not required when top@@ ographic re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ x@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and a federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine should be used only during pregnancy when a top@@ ographical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ended or continued the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go is continued / termin@@ ated between the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have been applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported @-@ effect irritation of the administration , which looked at about 1 % of the patients .

the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ or of bacterial proteins of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial fabrics .

there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .

res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adult , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine was issued daily at oc@@ clu@@ sion and placed on a ton@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected wounds were generated individual plastic m@@ b .
the sampling took place on the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the final application .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect liver ) in children between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
ambient temperature , Ambi@@ rix is used within a framework of two doses , whereby protection against Hepatitis B may possibly only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination may be led at the end of two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired to Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix may be given or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ying of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the Twin@@ rix System since 1996 and has been approved for Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered for children under one of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix include identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed one month after the last injection of antibodies .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix looks at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar at a sea level and at a 12 @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the inj@@ ecting location , redness , mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient may not be used in patients who may not be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) to be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for inclusion of Ambi@@ rix all over the world
the Stand@@ ardi@@ al plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose agreed between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her is desired both for Hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ous vaccines or with a compromise .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies lie in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ ous vaccines .
it is not yet fully secured , whether imm@@ utable competent persons , who have addressed to a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her as protection , as they are also protected at no longer veri@@ fiable antibodies .
3 As with all injection mol@@ ds should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ al scheme is recommended with the combination machine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ able hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able viral hepatitis B surface .
at the theft of patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , under circumstances there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
since a intra@@ day injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to an optimal impact success , these injections should be avoided .
however with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected to be sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as in these cases , in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift can come to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year in the form of a separate inj@@ ecting ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cara vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ on m@@ umps vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ on m@@ umps Vacc@@ ine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective need to be presum@@ ed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical trial , which has been carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , matri@@ ces , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed with the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ al@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants between the ages of 12 and 15 , at the age of 15 , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mats on a comp@@ utation basis for vaccination ambi@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ utation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the ban@@ ban@@ den , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the test of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the complete vaccination cycle 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the ban@@ ban@@ den who had given ambient temperatures , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % at the ban@@ ban@@ den , which were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combin@@ ant .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ity was comparable ( i.e. over the whole vaccine in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the ban@@ ban@@ den who received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the ban@@ ban@@ den , which got the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant ) .
the frequency of pre@@ matur@@ ely pain and matri@@ arch was low and comparable to those that after administration of the compromise with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed .
in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the appearance of loc@@ al@@ re@@ actions and general agents were comparable to that , with administration with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ able viral hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able viral hepatitis B surface .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ s , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix been a common appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ecting location ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .

clinical trials included in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to 15 years were the ser@@ oc@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ oid conver@@ sions for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out by 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans were Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination with three doses .
at the 2@@ 89 persons , whose immuno@@ ass@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ dos@@ ages , it was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ in@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine .
the investig@@ ational immun@@ o campaign against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which , after vaccination of 3 doses , with a compromise @-@ based Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies to be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as by bathing in the wat@@ ered waters .
you may feel very tired have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix may not be completely protected from infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination is completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child in front of the administration of both vaccination ambi@@ rix already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / Your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccine may possibly not prevent a vaccination .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those according to Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed .
• If your child has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by ju@@ ck@@ eting skin r@@ ashes , respiratory or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or H@@ CV . • If you have a severe infection with fever in case you / your child .
• If you want to have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually intended administration of the second vaccination osis ) .
with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / Hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content to effective components per vaccination ( 360 ELISA units of a formal Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered for a month after the first dose and might give you a vaccination protection against termination of the vacc@@ inations .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , suffer from the skin and not into the muscle . • if you / your child is weak@@ ened up due to a disorder or treatment in your / her body @-@ def@@ ences / or if you / your child moves to a h@@ our@@ se .

21 Sa@@ gen your doctor if you / your child take additional medicine / takes ( including those that you have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as diverse limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix is not administered to pregnant or nursing women except it is urgent that it is vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since issuing the first permit for marketing authorisation , CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
as Ambi@@ rix not only has been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited due to small patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ dem@@ a enzyme def@@ ective or with hyp@@ am@@ mon@@ oli@@ tic En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage , as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ ular de@@ centr@@ ations ) in the pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - divided into several individual pants at meals - swal@@ lowed through the food or via a pub stom@@ a ( through the abdom@@ en into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo ( a placebo medicine , i.e. without real substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause loss of loss in blood , depression , irritation , headaches , impotence , impotence or taste version , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as due to the r@@ arity of the disease , there is only limited information on this medicine at the time of authorisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients in which a full enzyme lack is already manifested in the newborn age ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form ( including enzyme defect , which manifes@@ ts after the first life of life ) , there is an indication of the use when in the am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephal@@ opathy consists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ ck@@ iness is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in granite form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account prot@@ ections and the necessary daily protein intake .

AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets should not be administered in patients with lo@@ op@@ tic disorders , since there is a risk to the emergence of o@@ cular ho@@ gan@@ y when the tablets enter not immediately in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ tention and oils .
da met@@ abol@@ ishing and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rian occurs via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure can only be used with extreme caution .
the importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ ters G@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young ro@@ ar in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and a hei@@ gh@@ tened loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a wasted matur@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be observed if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated with humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS joined in 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( 139 1 / 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( € 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic endor@@ sement , severe hypo@@ kal@@ mia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ mia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose stood at a 5 @-@ month old to@@ dd@@ ler with a predictable single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , that showed a dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic compound that con@@ i@@ dered by ac@@ et@@ y@@ elling with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is eliminated through the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etric is not comparable to urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess rogen nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be presum@@ ed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is important that diagnosis starts early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome .
the prognosis of the early mani@@ ac form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost inf@@ anti@@ st , and the disease resulted in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their stu@@ d @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by u@@ en@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen compounds ( sodium poly@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate and Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ ate and natural sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to diagnose illnesses to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first emergence of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many too mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form of the condition ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ thic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ kable trans@@ ac@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ographic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently were treated permanently with sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ectable diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ serving in liver and kidney disease with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ism in plasma and urine were given after gin of a single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with liver disease and liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after individual , as well as repeated gifts of or@@ ic doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gases ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ con@@ centric formations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders or ha@@ il@@ glo@@ om@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day of up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ ally , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma det@@ ectable .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate Con@@ centr@@ ations in the plasma bars in the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours of approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ate product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ om@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no en@@ cla@@ dic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who have not yet swal@@ low any tablets or have given patients with lo@@ op@@ ha@@ p or a guest @-@ stom@@ ach@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ ville .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at newborn , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially tw@@ isted amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal area .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac lack of car@@ b@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ kable trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when R@@ atten@@ f@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , there came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic endor@@ sement , severe hypo@@ kal@@ mia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ mia , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally is seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for any grams of sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen can be produced .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
after a oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ con@@ centric formations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can retain the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a Son@@ de , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS before use also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzy@@ mes are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ able waste products that accum@@ ulate to eating proteins in the body .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used for treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or myo@@ car@@ dium ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ al@@ ous measurement with the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who will undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow and raise the effectiveness of PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients attended the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all types or combined with a gly@@ co@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional comp@@ bin@@ der treatment with he@@ et@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during PCI , patients frequently became a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a lock ) , and they also received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients experiencing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in regards to all indicators as well as he@@ et@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than s@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components .
it may also not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with heavy hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee on Human Advisory Board ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during an PCI an an@@ able substitute for he@@ et@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for marketing by angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( instinc@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ el@@ inf@@ g ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) if an early intervention is envisaged .
the recommended initi@@ ald@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if in another episode a PCI is performed , an additional bolt from 0,5 mg / kg has been given and the in@@ fusion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to PCI , the reduced In@@ fu@@ sion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ts should be administered from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ op@@ last@@ y .
the recommended dosage of an@@ x@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ al intraven@@ ous bol@@ ts of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one itself immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the operation .
the safety and effectiveness of a single stu@@ d gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) to 225 second , a second shaft of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the reconstructed and dil@@ uted medicine before the use carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is rapidly administered by intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , a further surveillance is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney problems ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is below 225 second , a second stu@@ d@@ dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also at di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox Con@@ tra@@ inde@@ xed ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be introduced 30 minutes after completion of intraven@@ ous gases of un@@ questionable yeast or 8 hours following the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of lower molecular ho@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other ingredients or against hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or irreversible drug endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients may be monitored during the treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine occur most blood tests on arter@@ ial score points , can undergo from patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere blood tests .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International standardization ( International standardization ) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , once again reached before the treatment existing level .
proceeding from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) may be presum@@ ed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ springs or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ st@@ as@@ e@@ parameters in any case regularly to control .

severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI measures for heavy blood tests , as defined in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ print@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY wei@@ ght@@ less bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ oral , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular bleeding or surgical intervention required , lowering of the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ bin@@ spiegel from ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood @-@ angle , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6,000 patients who subjected to PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in @-@ treated comparisons , it came to women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently to undes@@ irable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less frequently than in the comparative group under He@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported on a comprehensive application in practice and are sorted by system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in the case of anec@@ d@@ ation the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine must immediately break off and monitor the patient from ti@@ ghter with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , a direct and specific Th@@ ro@@ m@@ bin@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center as well as the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ closure region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether it is tied to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the attachment of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with that its effect , is rever@@ sible , since Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ on hand spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Ar@@ g@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thus creating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generated .
in addition , it was caused by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with ser@@ um of patients , in which it has come to he@@ et @-@ induc@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ et@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , which indu@@ ce no th@@ rot@@ ary ag@@ gregation @-@ reaction .

if a PCI was performed in the patient following a PCI , an additional bolt from 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be increased and the in@@ fusion increases for the duration of the surgery to 1,@@ 7@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ questionable he@@ et@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ theid was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ el@@ ac ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .

Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for treatment of adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , which is inj@@ ected the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in the regulation of glucose pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process the ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin is very slightly different from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects more quickly and has a shorter activity than a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in the application in combination with a lengthy ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in case of type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is in@@ effective in non @-@ effective , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes was established after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( of 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin gene .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human standard ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood glucose level .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is considered to be sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ en , the sky@@ line or the del@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal wall .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and the diminished amount of ins@@ ulin the ins@@ ulin can be imp@@ acted in patients with a restriction of the liver function .
any change in force , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or producer method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand .
3 A insufficient dosage or the demo@@ lition of treatment , particularly in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change at the switching of the A@@ chem@@ a .
to the substances that can enhance blood sugar @-@ sugar activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , fi@@ br@@ ate , Pent@@ ano@@ dis@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , S@@ ali@@ zy@@ l@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ ched counter regulation will be dis@@ coura@@ ged or missing .
animal &apos;s experimental studies on Re@@ productive Tox@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post @-@ natural development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether ins@@ ulin det@@ ach to the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ ted after oral application .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia with awareness can be given by means of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by a trained person or by intraven@@ ous gases by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the ur@@ ren@@ cy of the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the inhibit@@ or of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ ters Ga@@ el@@ be of ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the real time is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , ins@@ ulin showed a dose of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg one for the dose of dis@@ proportionate power consumption , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a lower increase in the glucose level effect , just like Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin has twice as fast efficiency as normal human ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete drau@@ ght joint effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
the data was apparent that in an application of ins@@ ulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable , gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human standard ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal - was achieved better on @-@ scale control than with human standard ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if ins@@ ulin is wasted in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human@@ ised standard ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .

ins@@ ulin ulin in G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
