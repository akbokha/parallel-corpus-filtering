<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Council Regulation (EPAR) in which explains how the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package holder (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets as a solution to capture (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. enterres thinking and spreaders, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things which are not present), distrust and inscriptions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental condition where the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify will be used for the treatment of medisevere heavier episodes and the prevention of Manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied to rapid control of disturbed anxiety or behavioural disorders if the orale intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both conditions the solution can be taken or the melting tables in patients may be applied to those raging of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as bilify fy, should be adjusted, the dosage should be adjusted from bilify fy.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as "partial Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder carries a role, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychotic or manic symptoms, and their recurrence will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of bilify that prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injector resolution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to disturbed anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with halidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been retreating for 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with bilify fy.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of bilify injector solution was found in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which were involved in disturbed anxiety, with which by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the modification of the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies in order to investigate as the body absorbed the melting tablets and the solution to deposit.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injecting solution, patients showed that bilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly increased reduction of symptoms spread more undisturbed than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applied to the treatment of bipolar disorder, disbilify in four of the five short-time studies have more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Bilify also prevented up to 74 weeks long more effective than placebo the recurrence Manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms spread and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify to capture (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapolenz (lack of movement), vomiting (tremor), vomiting (perstipation), vomiting and exhaustion (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Advisory Board (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bilify in treating schizophrenia and severe severe episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole spoke to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injecting solution in fast control of disturbed anxiety and behavioural symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder if an oral therapy is not suitable to weigh against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the inclusion of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combinational therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients (65 years) has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower Initialdosis should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Indus is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy, also in treating Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased suicide risk with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease (myocardiac infapy or ischaemia diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony predispose (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood-printing medicines) or hypertension (including aphrodisiac and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripiprazant Dyskinesis.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest to a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics have to be decreased, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripipraole should be used in patients with cramps in the anamnese or in states that are related to cramps, be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients associated with Alzheimer's disease patients had been treated with Aripiprazole, increased mortality rate compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the incentive for unwanted cerebrovascular events in with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoaziosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of the deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manager, the use of antipsychotics in which weight gain is known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and might lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotiine, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the remnant rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy Probanden increased a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) the AUC of Aripiprazole um 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosauctions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisierers may result in the common use with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration by Aripibenzene in comparison to CYP2D6 extensible Metabolisians.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considering the common gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefits should overlull the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protesters, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosauctions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After abortion of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY at the start of the escort.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses showed 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day not a significant effect on the metabolites of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warcolorant) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the human being and due to the concerns in repression, this medicine must not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of, dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate until they are certain that Aripipraises has no negative influence on it.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (Acts 1 / 100) than on placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency shown below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of more than 52 weeks, patients with Aripiprazole were treated, a total reduced incidence (25,8%) from EPS including parsonism, acathonas, Dystonie and Dyskinesis, compared to patients treated with semiidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14,8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Scientific episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under semiidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes occurred in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, revealed not medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine-phosphorkinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of the patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome include, late dyskinesis and cramps, unwanted events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch have been unintentionally or intentional prevalence with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hacker in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; it is unlikely, however, that Häzalysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefit, because Aripiprazole has a high plasma rate.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder about the combination of a participatory effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to the Histamin-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazene in doses from 0,5-30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy probanden showed a dose-dependent reduction in the bond of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liganden, on Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operated survey, 52 percent of the Respous patients who taught a response to the study medication, in both groups (Aripibenzene 77% and Haldidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement instrumentation, which were defined as secondary study programmes, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressants - scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement as in holding idol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction of relentrates that lay at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% on placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an ox-controlled, multinational double-blind study of schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients were involved and in which the primary study of weight loss (N = 18 or 13% of value-value patients) occurred at significantly less patients a weight gain from at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled Monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole a compared to placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole versus placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebound and actively-controlled Monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bee-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a compared to placebo over-leased effectiveness in week 3 and a entertaining effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or semiconductors in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also referred to 12 a comparable portion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Mania on how lithium or semioperated dol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic features, which, partly over 2 weeks do not appear on licensing or Valproat monotherapy in therapeutic treatments, revealed the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached with Aripiprazole during a stabilizing phase before Randomisation, showed herself to consider Aripiprazole versus placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar replica, predominantly in preventing a relapse back into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydration of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyulation is being catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination period is approximately approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole at approximately CYP2D6 and with approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolisians over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripiprazene, there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy probanden, as well as a pharmacoinetic examination of schizophrenia, no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A non-specific evaluation of the drug coinetics revealed not an indication of clinically significant differences in terms of ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceutical coinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmakokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Strethydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Progangs with different engradiant liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of Aripiprazole and Strethydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies for safety ressing, toxicity in repetitive gases, reproduction, Genotoxicity and for the canogenic potential, the preclinical data could not recognize any particular threat to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxikologically significant effects were observed merely with doses or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced a dose-dependent side kidney disease (AUC) at rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 45 mg / kg / carcinoma at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times of the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis during the human being).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a Cholelial asis has been determined as a result of the curing of sulphatitudes of Aripiprazole in the Galle from ape to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3ly the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81triple of the recommended Maximaldosis in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, those found in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of hydroxyz conjugate of hydroxycylbenzene no more than 6% of the concentrations that were established in the study over 39 weeks in the Gall of monkeys, and lie far among the border values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">At rabbits these effects were observed according to doses, which led to expospositions of the 3- and 11,000 of the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maxaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity can be calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events have been reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no causal connection was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Pacpacaxel is an antimikrallubules, which promotes the imposition of microtubules from the TubulIndia and stabilizes the microtubules due to the imitation of their landolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a inhibitor of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikro-stretching network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the Transzytosis of plasma components into endothrotary cells and in the context of in-vitro studies have been proven that the present of Albumin supports the transport of Paclitaxel by the endothylene cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved trandothelial transportation is conveyed by the gp-60 album receptor and due to the albuminbic protein SPARC (secreted protein disdic rich in cysteine) is a Paclitaxel accumulation in the scope of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of myxane for metastatic mammacarcinoma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-established studies and from 454 patients who were treated in randomised phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma were treated with myxane, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 used as infusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma were used.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was carried out in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma carried out every 3 weeks a monotherapy with paclitaxel, either in the form of solvent mediaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of myxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without Premedication (N = 229).</seg>

<seg id="320">The Clearance of Pacpacaxel was higher (43%) as after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher with myxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro-studies of human liver microsome and tissues, the paclitaxel is primarily related to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metal abolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After an 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 (xane) in patients with metastatic mammacarcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary tract with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-rency Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his supervisors, provided that they have received adequate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who maintain a chemotherapy, the Hämoglobinos should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per Deciliter at adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron lack is, and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who have received chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems may be an anaemia due to a erythropoietinal lack or by the fact that the body is not sufficient to address the body's own Erythropoietin.</seg>

<seg id="369">Abseamed was referred to as an injection in a vein as part of a main study with 479 patients, caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a Vene, before they were placed either by seamed or continue to be Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the variation of the hemoglobinaries between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also submitted the results of a study where the effects of under the skin has been examined by those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and follicas can vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A hemoglobin increase in excess of 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed in a patient individually Hämoglobinaries about or under the hemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>

<seg id="390">If the Hämoglobinary is calculated by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent tick-globe exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa-dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be tighter to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for controlling anaemia and anaesymptomless symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results indicate that patients with initial high lower HB value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher yields than patients in which initial anemia is less heavy (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="645">Unique and multi-time 5 and 15-minute difusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients received the following pharmakokinetic data that proved to be dosisindependently.</seg>
<seg id="646">Afterwards, the plasma bars took off quickly from &lt; 10% of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphashic disappearance of the large cycle with half-life of ½ α 0,24 and t ½% 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period of ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages phases (α and β, with the above-called ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance is independent of the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs cleaning - concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration on time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance from Cytochrom-P450-enzyme materialized substances is unlikely because of customs acid in humans is not yet metabolized and because it is a watchful or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism of inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renaissance Clearance of Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in the agent 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in the fact that an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the customs acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for heavy kidney disorder (Kreatinel Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, there are no statements possible for these population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-effective intravenous dose was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, individual pants of 1,0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 62.1 of the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered for over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use has been administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-minute infusion in 3-minute infusion (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 70s of human therapeutic exposure, related to AUC, equivalent), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repetitive expositions which exceeded the maximum of intended Human-exposure, advocated toxiological effects among other organs, including the Gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common test of studies with repeated application was a provisioned primary spongiosa in the metaphysical point of animals in the Growth phase with almost all doses, a report which reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorting effect of substance.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public, the present document is a summary of the European Public Health Council Regulation (EPAR), which assessed the studies conducted by the Committee for Humanism (CHMP), in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Accounts are used for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin diabetes). • It may be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) when metformin (a diabetesdrug) is not shown. • It may be applied together with another diabetesmedicine (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which can not be satisfactory with metformin alone in the highest standard dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl vaccine or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl vaccine or insulin may be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonyl vaccine or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better to be used and the blood sugar levels decreases, causing type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in Tripletherapy has been studied; in this, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl fuel, in addition they were either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Accounts led to a reduction in HbA1c-Value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced in applying the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift from accounts to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl values at 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, where the combination of accounts and insulin were examined in 289 patients, patients who recorded accounts in addition to insulin, lowering the HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took extra placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with accounts were visual defects, infections of the upper airways (cold cuts), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (diminished sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts cannot be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic caetoaziosis - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that accounts are intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients when metformin is not shown.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and in which metformine is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients infected by the presence at least a risk factor (e.g. younger heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or oil, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a cardiac insufficiency, weight gain and odems, when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiocular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-advanced macrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on cardiac insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liabilities (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror increases up to 3-times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible again control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops, which point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, Oberbauchism and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzymes to verify.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient treatment is continued with pioglitazone, should be guided to the presentation of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that may arise from liposuction and in some cases is associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a consequence of a hull, under the therapy with Pioglitazone, a minor reduction in the middle hulum values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients under metformine (relative reduction of hemoglobin um 3-4% and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin um 1-2% and haematology by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity, patients, the pioglitazon as oral or triple compression therapy with insulin pump, or as two-time combinant therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market introduction was reported below the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazon, an occurrence or a deterioration of diabetic maculaodems with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the ingestion of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of Makulaödems if patients report about interference of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bonnet, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The complainant incidence amounted to 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patient-years in patients with pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, met with Pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fraktures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be taken (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocymon and metformine.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oric contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium and HMGCoA reductive inhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemmozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and therefore reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for federal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turgors and the break-indexes of the lens, as they are observed also with other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT attachments occurred over the triple of the cap of the standard range frequently on like under placebo, but more rare than in comparison groups under metformine or sulfonyl.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than those of placebo if Pioglitazon or w.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction, it has rarely reported on cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon, though, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to fractures, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients with pioglitazon treated groups and about 7,400 patients treated with comparatively medication-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years ongoing proactive study, fractures stood at 44 / 870 (5,1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2,5%) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-g)) which leads to an increased insulin of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and boosts the peripheral glucose evaluation in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time up to the retrofitting of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c 5.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy a blood sugar control could be sustained (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebocontrolled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomized despite dreadonatical optimisation phase with insulin, randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the middle HbA1c reduced value to 0.45%, compared to the patients who continue to only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the treated group has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease of the album / creatinin quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week examination of type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-glycemeride and the free fatty acids and a rise in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly increased cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasticglycemeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterinlevels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared with placebo, under Pioglitazon, there was no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while metformin and Gliclacide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon is not only the sober-glyceride, but improved also on the development of the triglyceride absorption, both on an effect on the triglycemeride absorption as well as on the hepatic triglyczeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiocular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-advanced macrovascular disease randomized in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazon is rapidly resorbed, whereby the peak concentration on unchanging pioglitazone generally reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness of roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactional studies, Pioglitazon could not be proven any relevant effect on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocymon and metformine.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Gemmozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) or lowers the Plasmaconcentric of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive markoglitazon in humans the marker was mainly found in the case (55%) and a lesser extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unchanging pioglitazone amounts to man 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmaconcentric of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy probances, but resemble the margins of the orical Clearance of the mother-substance.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxiological studies focused on mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated administration, anaemia and reversible eccentric ventric cardiac hypertropphy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of familial pathic Polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colonizers.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and on one side the marking "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The complainant incidence amounted to 1.9 questionnaires per 100 patient-years in patients with pioglitazon treated women and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, met with Pioglitazon patients, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 Fraktures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of a combination of metformin are examined with pioglitazon or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, under Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease of the album / creatinin quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study about 20 weeks, Pioglitazon is not only the sober-glyceride, but improved beyond an effect on the tryglycemeride absorption as well as on the hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study appropriated the target with regard to its primary endpoint, stroke, acute coronation and revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not associated with cardiovascular risk of long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to be assessed as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the safety test of ADVATE, which requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the marketing owner should apply another renewal procedure for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially distributed to the Committee of Human Advisory Board (CHMP) officially that the company has regained its application for approval by Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it may carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that was changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus do not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocacy should have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed by the non-defective in the human body existing p53 gene, contributes normally to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-cancer, in which the p53-Gen is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study involving a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of the sub-building, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Once the CHMP had examined the answers of the company on the questions asked to him, some questions were unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents, the CHMP on day 120 created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">"" "" "" "according to CHMP, not enough proved that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors will bring benefits to the patient." ""</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficient that Advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient is harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company wasn't aware of the CHMP opinion whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical studies or "comend use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed 'delay' means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other slowly released over several hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is applied to the treatment of the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, by an allergy to pollen, inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal slices (petrifter nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young adults aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a tablet daily with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-endometrium (petted nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug use the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effect could be the changes of the severity of the hay fever, reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients received their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a default skala as difficult as the symptoms in the last 12 hours were.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hakeable symptoms besides the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the aerinaze reported on a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who captured pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-endometrium was considered, the patients under the aerinaze showed a alleviation of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients, the desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachyarming (carditis), swelling, headache, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), obstruction, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolenz (sleeplessness), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are potentially hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoepheine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or wreatadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not to be used.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a bottangle glaucoma (increased water pressure), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), cardiac or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroa (overflow of the thyroid) or have had a risk for a hereof stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission of SP Europe divided a licence for the marketing of aerobaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, is however swallow in the whole (that is, without having to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the failure of data.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after expiration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the use of application for 10 days, since long-term application the activity of pseudoepheats can decrease in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the mucosas in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because aerinaze contains pseudoepheine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstritors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, hydro-dopamine, phenylepin, ephedrine, oxidants, oxymetacolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data are not sufficient to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about the treatment with the occurrence of hypertension or a tachykarder or from Palastations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardiac infg in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronchosfitting in the amnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing gender-based tests because anti-histaminika otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin transactions or reduce their scale.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the Plasmaconcentric of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test could not be any significant differences between the patients treated with DESloratadine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether it was taken by lorloratadine or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme required for the metabolic ism of desloratadine enzyme has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-glycoroteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unthinkable use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not backed up, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities associated with frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Because reproduction studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to vasoconstrikic properties of pseudoepheine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be elucidated about it in very rare cases that it may occur in very rare cases to lead to a impairment of transportation or ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a ZNS-depression (sedation, apnea, lessened mental attention, combo, cardiovascular collision) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, frightening injury, muscular weakness and increased muscle strain, euphoria, arousal, breathing failure, vomiting, vomiting, nausea, vomiting, tonality, visual impairment and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is especially likely, as well as athertropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupillenrigid and - dilatation, bonding, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the imitation of the release of propulsion cytokinen such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mastal cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibitor of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-Selektin on endothrotary cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes, including the strengthening of subjective ramifications, or the tasks connected with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">Controlled clinical trials has been determined by recommended dosage of 5 mg per day for increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoepheine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympometic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, an emachykarmic or manifestation of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, where 414 patients were Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall condition for symptoms (except nasal slippers), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudo epheine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets in view of the diminishing effect, determined by the nasal slider swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study for the drug coinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze at healthy probanden over 14 days the flow of weight loss of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoepheath was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmakokinetic multi-dose study, which has been performed with the formulation as tablets of healthy adult probanden, was found that four trials of the desloratadine was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component Interactional study reveals that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoepheine according to the only gift of pseudoepheine was bioequivalent to exposure to the gift of a aerinaze pill.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies for safety ressing, for toxicity in repeatability, to Genotoxicity and the Reproductive Toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine does not allow special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination co-owned no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoepheine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-reproductive studies, the combination of Loratadine / pseudoepheine was in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1747">Persists allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall level of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctica, Aerius effectively diminished the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigating other forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathphysiological pathology despite the etiology in the different forms are similar and chronic patients can be simpler prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a decisive factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that Desloratadine is also in other forms of urticaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quaddling at the end of the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika with chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not reacted to antihistaminika, excluded from the study.</seg>

<seg id="1756">No indications for a clinically relevant grief after once daily use of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, it has not been identified for the metabolites of desloratadin responsible enzyme however, so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-glycoroteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadine in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, low-calorie breakfast) does not affect the availability of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Which demonstrated with desloratadine and Loratadin performed preclinical studies, at a comparable degree of exposure of disaster atadine, no qualitatively or quantitative differences in regard to the toxicity of desloratadine and by Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below Section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with aserius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis should play a role in diagnosis, physical studies and corresponding laboratory and skin investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolism, desloratadine reduced and experience higher substantive load (see below Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1774">Children between the ages of 1 and 11 years, which were asked for antihistamine therapy comprising 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic Urtikaria and the profile of desloratadine in adults and children are similar, the efficacy issue of desloratadine can be manipulated in adults to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical trial involving multi-professional users of adults and adolescents, applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis's Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed to the Committee of Human Advisory Board (CHMP), that the company has regained its application for authorisation from Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied by adults and elderly people to protect flu, caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could cause a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus emerges, which can easily spread from human to human beings, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as" "" "body-foreign" "" "and forms antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will be able to form faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then, the membrane id of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the diaphragm surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-alien) separated and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">This resulted in the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine not to meet the requirements of the EMEA for preparative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you require further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with human immunodeficiency virus from type 1 (HIV-1) which is inflicated by the acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Aciase is not available as a solution for insertion, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir since the security of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Axiase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral medicines of the patient has previously taken, and the probability has assessed the virus to address the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice a day of 100 mg of kavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of amaase is based on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Axiase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not cure, however, can delay the immune system and thus delay the development of with AIDS related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Axias was examined in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, studied in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously been treated with a protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1912">That with low dosified Ritonavir drugs Aciase was compared with 206 adults, who had previously taken in the protesters, with other protesters.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (virus last) or the change in the virus after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously taken no protesters, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than below placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, aging Ascare also caused the Viral last but with the children who were treated earlier with protesters, very few in the treatment languages.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which had been treated earlier with proteasants, this with Ritonavir boosts, the Viral last after 16-week treatment were as effective as other protesters:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protesters, it came under atherase together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the Viral last after four weeks as in patients who continued to advance their previous protesters:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of atherase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea (nausea), nautical (nausea), vomiting, rash and the Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Aciase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against ampspecavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Axiase may also not be applied to patients who are curated (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or medicines that are just as atherase or are harmful in high concentrations in the blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the risk of cerebrodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrose (die of bone tissue) or an immunodeficiency syndroms (symptoms of a infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Human Advisory Board (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of aging medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Axiase is usually taken together with the pharmakokinetic amplifier, but the Committee noted that the use of aging in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no protesters, is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as at the time the approval was limited for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group to generate a licence for the marketing of generals throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Axiase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protesters (PI), and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmakokinetic boostation of amaavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amaavir should be done in consideration of the individual viral hergsters and the patient treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amaavir as a solution to inhale is 14% less than capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aging capsules is 600 mg amspecavir twice daily along with 100 mg konavir twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Ascare capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (booksing), higher doses must be applied to axias (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg amkled / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amspecavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceutical, effectiveness and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protesters were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aging is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the failure of data to inconceivable and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokokinetic data the dose should be reduced to amgenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver-dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be made with caution in patients with mild or more liver disorder, in patients with severe liver disorder, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Axiase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of Cytochrom P450-Isoename 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations that included currants (hypericum perforatum) must not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma-concentric and a reduced therapeutic effect of Amspecavir during the intake of amaavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerative or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunist infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aging does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, aging capsules are to be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients infected with chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an antiretroviral compression therapy, have increased risk of heavy liver damage effects with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function including a chronic-active Hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver-dysfunctions under an antiretroviral compression therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of axias and Ritonavir with fluticeor other glucocorticosteroids, which over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Morbus Cusi, and suppressing the renal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and simvastatin strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous arrangement of atheratin with Lovastatin and simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopathia, including Rhabdomyolysen not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For several medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warnings (under supervision of the International Standardisation ratio), methods for determining the drug Concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking these drugs at the same time, amaase may be less effective for decreased plasma bars of amaavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amaavir may be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with Amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentless symptoms, especially if it is also used for low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity to be toxicity due to the high propagate content, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution at certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Axiase should be set on duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protesters, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exhilaration of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, their therapy medicines needed to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">A mophiles patients (type A and B) who were treated with proteasants, are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous-cutaneous hematoma and hamarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with heavy immune defective patients may develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual infection that leads to serious clinical trials or degradation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial Equtiology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immune system, higher Body measure index), cases of osteonecrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral compression therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Aciase may not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of Cytochrom P450-Isoenms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Ascare with chionavir must not be given along with pharmaceuticals, whose agents are mainly transmitted over CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasma bars with heavy and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in AUC by Amspecavir that can lead to a virological failure and a resaboo development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to detect the lowest plasma bars through a dosage increased from other protein-inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were observed very often unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johanniswort (hypericum perforatum) The serum mirror of amaavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient occupies already curated, the speckled mirror, and, if possible to check the Viral last and avoid the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amspecavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax by 30% lower when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amaavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg Amspecavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and inconceivable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amspecavir in plasma, which were reached in combination of amaavir (600 mg twice daily) with lime (400 mg / kavir + 100 mg konavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of kavir twice daily administered.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dodging for the simultaneous administration of amaavir and calcium can not be given, but it is recommended, however, a narrowly monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmakokinetic study carried out in combination with divergence, but is recommended due to the antasia component of Didanosin, that the revenue of didanosine and Agenerative ase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore at the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amaavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) No dosage adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amaavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protests would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapon to other protesters and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapon may sunk into the serum concentric of amaavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made since an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Amspecavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amaavir and rifabutin led to a rise in the Plasmaconcentric (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin is needed together with asamase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerations in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, however, the plasma-bars of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily metoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole a day at 2.6961 compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamkled with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with aging effects, may result in interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored by toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines, when they are applied in combination with aging.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protesters, it is advisable that antacids may not be taken at the same time as atherase, as it may come to resortic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-volcanic antidepressants known as enactants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amaavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasma bars of Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Fellow pin, nickel-pin, nickel pin, nickel pin, nickel pin, nickel pin, nickel pin, nickel pin and Verapamil may be increased by Amspecavir, which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with asynase can increase their plasma concentration, and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden have been significantly increased, while the endogenous Kortisol increased by about 86% (90% -Konfidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of asgenerations with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticosteroids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is heavily dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced reduction in plastic containers at the same administration of amgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma-mask increases this HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathia, including a Ruldomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amspecavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, since the Plasmakonzentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus at the same gift of amaavir can be increased (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be applied together with oral biased midazolam (see Section 4.3) while at the same use of asgenerations with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protesters, indicate a possible increase in the plasma bars of midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amspecavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatentless symptoms, especially if it is also used for low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as the amaavirx dose is to customize when Amspecavir is administered at the same time using methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the simultaneous gift of warfarin or other orical anticoagulants along with axias, an increased control of INR (International Standardisation ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombogenic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not foreseeable, so also alternative methods are recommended to contraception methods.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended for the confederation of amgenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful clearance of possible usage for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated rats, amaavir-related substances have been proven, however, it is not known whether Amspecavir is overflowing with people to the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of bearded rats, which was administered from indemnification into the uterus until the end of the lactation Amspecavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including Fertility and Reproduction capacity was not affected by the administration of Amspecavir to the mother tier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The immemorial of Aciase was examined in adults and children under 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side-related side effects were light up to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are applied in connection with the intake of ingenerative or other at the same time to the HIV treatment applied or whether they are a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned adverse reactions come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with proteasants, patients received 1200 mg of aging twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), which were viewed by the investigator than in connection with the study medication, and in over 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of treatment laboratories (degrees 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral therapy has been associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy), including a loss of peripheral and fast fatty tissue, hypertrophic and visceral fat tissues, hypertrophic the breasts and thorny fats (stickers).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 anti-reviewed persons, who were treated with amaavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mid duration of 36 weeks, was only observed one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- subject to patients under Amspecavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a medium term of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually easy to moderate, erythematic or makulopapulous nature, with or without itchiness and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with amaavir had to be broken.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose in particular were reported in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral compression therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV-infected patients with heavy immune defective patients may develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual infection (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In case of PI patients infected 600 mg of generase twice daily along with low dosified konavir (degrees 3 to 4) and lab changes (degrees 3 to 4) and lab changes (degrees 3 to 4) and CPK values that were found among patients who received apgenerase together with low dosified konavir, very frequently occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the case of an overdose the patient is observed on signs of an intoxiation (see Section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supportive policies.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amaavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protein and thereby prevents the process of viral viral and Gag-pol- Polyproteination with a result of education inmature, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amspecavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied both acute and chronic lymphotic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as in the peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) from Amspecavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in akut infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µm for chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amaavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibitor of the HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of non-untreated patients with the currently approved Fosamkled / Ritonavir dosages - as with other kavionavir inhibitors, the described mutations rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretrospeckled patients, the 700mg Fosamkled with 100mg sproonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, joined a virologistic failure up to week 48, where 14 insulates genotypically could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the Isolate of 13 of 14 children, in which a virologistic failure was taken within the 59, with proteasants not previously treated patients, showed resaboo patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2185">If follow up-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesions are only incomplete, another therapy should be started (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">When a dose was left, the patient should wear the cream once he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod-cream is applied in a thin layer and in the purified, with cowardiwarts infected skin area, until the cream is completely moved.</seg>

<seg id="2191">With an application of Imiquimod Cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is an elevated risk of heavy local skin irritation (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, also, under proper use of heavy local skin irritation, which had a treatment required and / or have led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occur at the exit of the urethra, some women had difficulty in urging that needed an emergency catheterization and a treatment of the affected area.</seg>

<seg id="2195">The treatment of the Basalcell gland with Imiquimod within 1 cm to the eyelids, the nose, the lips or the hairline has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local hood reactions are common, but the intensity of this reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form the conclusion of treatment with Imiquimod Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the complaints of the patient or due to the severity of local coexistence, a treatment break can be done by several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">At present no data on long-term healing rates are available for more than 36 months after treatment, should be considered superseapses or other suitable therapy forms.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrenating and subject-treated BCCs do not lie a clinical experience, therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tumours (&gt; 7,25 cm2) a lower likelihood of response to the Imiquimod therapy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not tested for the treatment of acute keratants on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lips area within the lipstick.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of aktineric keratosis to anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the aktinent keratosis on the underarms and hands support the effectiveness in this application's purpose, so that such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local hood reactions often occur, but these reactions usually take effect in the course of therapy to intensity or proceed after lowering the therapy with Imiquimod Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local hood transactions are severe discomfort or are very strong, the treatment can be exposed for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 files, lesions reported a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties Imiquimod should be applied with caution in patients who receive immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum Contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies the effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks or).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic inclusion of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratose has been observed with three times weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest pharmaceutical concentration in Serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0,1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the use of the face (12,5 mg, 1 single bag), on the scalp (75 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life was approximately 10times higher than the 2hour half-time after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this points to a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure pointed out that the resorption of Imiquimod to topical skin on MC-frequency skin of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that with healthy adult and adults with acute keratose or superficient decarbonation.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four months study on dermal Toxicity at the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg to significantly down-seated body weight and increased milk-weight; an also four months long-run study on the painting application revealed not similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity at mice in order administration at three days a week induced any tumors on the application side.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod possesses only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, is a risk to the man due to the systemic exposure to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the real-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with little UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was examined, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of gag concentrations in urine and regarding the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the Gag concentration in urine about 60%, and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver in the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), Hitzej, fever and reactions to the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side-effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen bags (a measurement of pneumonia), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and bulk solids.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme must be used in patients who may be greatly overhardy (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Drug Agency (EMEA) will be able to verify all new information, which may be known, and will be able to update this summary required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will receive patients who have Aldurazyme to observe the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the marketing of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cells (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is available for long-term enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mucopolysacchariosis I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the condition (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place through a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient contributes to it every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme for adults over 65 years was not determined, and for these patients there is no guarantee scheme to be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency was not determined, and for these patients there can be no problem scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion-conditioned reactions which are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or by the end of the incumbent on (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be tighter, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in a reasonable clinical setting, available immediately for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Because of the clinical Phase 3 study, we expect nearly all patients of IgG antibodies to laronidase typically form within 3 months from the date of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion reaction must be treated with caution in the use of aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience dealing with the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically risk of excessive risk of treatment must be cautious after a interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or anti-pyretika) to deal with minimise the potential of infusion-driven reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or medium-sized infusion reaction, treatment with antihistaminika and acetamol / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of infusion rate on half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction must be stopped infusion, until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistaminika and parobeacetamol / ibuprofen is tested.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the reaction occurred to be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 become (antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the pre-established reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracellular intake of laronidase is made.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not let direct or indirect effect on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natural development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there were no data on newborns who were expelled from Laronidase over the mother's milk, it is recommended to not satisfy the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects in clinical studies have been arranged mainly as infusion-conditioned reactions which were observed at 53% of the patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted medicines in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3- study and its prolongation at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequencies: very common (Revelation 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history occurred also severe reactions, including bronchospasm, respiratory stillness and facial wrinkles (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children infant drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported in a Phas- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe reduction and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment to a seroid version, whereby it occurred among patients under the age of 5 with a serious slowing form mostly within one month (average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study) were reported at 13 / 45 patients not by radioimmunoplantisation (RIP) Assay demonstrable antibodies, among which 3 patients, in which it has never been to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of antibody levels received a robust decrease in the gag-mirror in the harn, while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction of gag in the harn was ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutrality of inhibitors to the enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing Gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions, even though the appearance of undesirable pharmaceutical actions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The justification for the enzyme therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of a further accumulation of adequate restoration of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into Lysosomes, most likely about Mannella-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase-3 study conducted at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients expelled from the mean phenotype and only a patient referred to the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had a forciated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in 6-minutches.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label survey, where they got another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme, compared to the placebo group, an improvement of the lung function and the salviability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">During the open renewal study, an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as well as out of the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the commencement of FEV is clinically significant over this period clinically and the absolute lung-volumina is increasing further proportional to the height of grown-grown children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly surgery we reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the Gag mirror in the Harn (µg / mg Kreatinin) was found that remained constant up until the degree of study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogenic disease, between patients being considered by using a combined end point, the clinically significant change has been summarised for five efficacy approval (in 6-minute walking test, movement area of Schultergelks AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-year-old phase-2 study was conducted in which mainly the security and pharmackinetics of Aldurazyme was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with heavy skating shape and 4 with medium size form).</seg>

<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphate ase (AP), aspartat-Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be &lt; 3-fold of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosage can take place under Bersivity by the Nadirs of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the pre- hitting therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the notes in the tables 1, 2 and 3 which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity to develop (except neurotoxicity), the treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted, until the patient gets the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be broken when in patients after 2 dosages, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- continues with the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 Jahve- or compared to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk of risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to non-sufficient data for uncertainties and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Clinical trials were needed in patients with a creatinin Clearance from €45 ml / min. no dosage adaptations necessary to go beyond the dosage adapts for all patients recommended Dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance from below 45 ml / min was not adequate; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with liver disease limits from &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- marginal value and / or transaminasenvalues of &gt; the above-times of the upper limit value (at case of liver fluctuations) or &gt; 5,0-times of the upper limit value (in presence of liver metastatic breast) is not examined specifically in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the button of the button and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrogue increases once again a value of the 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombodied once again achieved a value of EUR 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage-reduction for further cycles based on the Nadir of absolute neutrality of neutrality, throtism and maximal non-hematological toxicity, as observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 spherical and non-curing toxicity such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie was beyed when a pre-treatment with folate and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be relied with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduce stress-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal anti-acid (&gt; 1.3 g per day) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- TENS 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which a therapy is provided with Pemetrexed, the intake of NSAIDs have to avoid treatment for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred, appropriate risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existence hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the ergometer will be weighed before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardium, and cerebrovascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this drug is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of glued vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage triggering, the reproductive capacity is made by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the treatment of treatment, consult with regard to the sparing conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) can lead high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicyllic acid in high doses (1,4 g a day) to a decreased sequel excretion with a result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicyleic acid in high doses.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and mindes- TENS 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-time as picro- xicam or Rofecoxidib, the simultaneous application has to be fixed at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the patient status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the INR (International standardization: ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient, with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for using Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- Antimubolites are expected during an application in pregnancy serious birth defects.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if absolutely prompt, and after careful clearance of the utility for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment start, advising on the spermacular preservative.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapy regimen, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy therapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the ingredient prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults, who received chemotherapy regimens, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapy regiments, which were strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients treated with Aloxi were not vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy regiments, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 81% of the patients treated with aloxi during 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting (153 from 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">If a comparison with Dolasetron lay these values in 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a licence for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting at strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting which is induced by a heavily emetogenic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a Corticosteroids due to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonotic tron can extend the collumpassage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty arrangement or signs of a submarine idle after the injection-tail.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the current gift of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Q- interval is extended or which tend to have such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with other chemotherapeutic agents, Aloxi is supposed to be used neither for prevention nor for treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In pre-clinical studies, Palonotic agents, counter-oriented activity of the five examined chemotherapy agents, not (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there were no significant pharmakokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose Palonotic tron and a Steady stealth concentration of Metoclopramids, one CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based on a population based pharmakokinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous Gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Amiproamethasone and Rifampicin, semioxetine, maroxetine, marincaine, seronavir, seronavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosis tron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, therefore Palonotic tron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side effects (total 633 patients), which at least possibly stood with aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive reactions and reactions to the administration of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of undesirable events such as in the other doons groups; there were no dose of drug relations to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis however probably no effective therapy in a Aloxian overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies were given a total of 1,132 patients, representing a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) were given on Day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total emetogenic chemotherapy with increased 60 mg / m2cannatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonotic tron, were given by patients who were given 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given to 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with heavily emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Clinical trials for indications in chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonotic tron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolphetron comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the iteration and repolarization of the Ionian channels and extend the duration of the shareholder to prolong.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy probances carried out was the assessment of the EKG-effects of I.B.V. in individual dosen from 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gases follows an initial lowering of the plasma-concentric, a slow elimination from the body with an average temperature interval of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum Plasmaconcentric (Cmax) and the area under the concentration Period (AUC0- ∞) are generally available in the whole dosage area of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg with gesting and cancer patients dosishable.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, which was measured at 11 Hodencarcinoma between day 1 and day 5 measured average (± SD) increase in Palonosis-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmakokinetic simulations, the total of 0.25 mg Palonotic Flowers rises to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), with which according to a intravenous intravenous administration; however, the Cmax was higher than 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are transformed into two primary metabolites which have compared to Palonotic tron above less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro-studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the metabolism of Palonotic tron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine, Palonotic agents made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous stud injection, the total body extension was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver disease the terminale Eliminationshalbulation and the average systemic exposure with Palonotic tron increases, a reduction of the dose is thus not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies revealed that Palonotic tron can block solely in very high concentrations of Ionian channels which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonotic tron (every dose corresponded in about the 30times of the therapeutic exposure to men) who were given daily over two years led to a increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreatic) and skin tumours at rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and since Aloxi are determined in a unique application, the relevance of these results will be low as to the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Advisory Board (CHMP) adopted a negative review, in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of hepatitis C has been approved for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon a biological drugs called Roferon-A should resemble an effective component to the same general practitioner, which is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "References" "" ")." ""</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were expressed in detail that data on the stability of the drug and the drug will not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, treated in the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">Following the treatment with Alpheon, the disease coincided with more patients than with the reference rate; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, the test resulted in the study conducted in the study, how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) triggering.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied for the treatment of impetigo (one with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (rissor or chifaded), depreciation and gensewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not supposed to be used to treat infections, which were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant stassus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against these kinds of infections may not appear.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo may be applied for patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2% of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not appeal to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should consider the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial flbosom (the parts of the bacteria, in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was replicated after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">During the treatment of infected hotwins of Altargo and cefalexin similar views: if the results of both studies have been combined with Hautwins, about 90% of the patients from both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, was found that Altargo has been caused by the treatment of abscesses (whipped-filled cavity in the body tissue) or of infections, which were detectable or presumably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Human Rights Reservation (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo weigh against the risks of the following superficial skin infections across the risks: • Impetigo, • infiltrated small infibers, depreciation or gensewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the marketing of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, in which two or three days does not show improvement, are to be investigated once more and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of raising or serious local irritation through the use of retapamulin saline the treatment is broken off, the saline carefully drained and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is supposed to be (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary sexual wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin was the efficacy of retaliamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin resistent pile hybrid hylococcus aureus (MRSA) insufficiently.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative treatment should be considered when after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or degradation of the infected one comes into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous use of reapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of the small Plasmakonzentrations, which were reached in human subjects upon topical skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant imitation can not be expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After constant gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin saline on chopped skin from healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dosisadapts are not required when topographic reapamine is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductionxicity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and a federal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin saline should be used only during pregnancy when a topographical antibacterial therapy is clear and the use of reapamulin is the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2697">In clinical studies at 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have been applied Altargo, the most common reported-effect irritation of the administration, which looked at about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by Fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of reapamulin is based on the selective inhibitor of bacterial proteins of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosoms, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bindomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-bindings and the Peptidyltransferasezcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this engagement party Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P-bindings and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be based on the local prevalence of resistance to the use of reapamulin in at least some infection forms, a consultation through experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment at S.aurreus, the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viruses (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adult, 1% retapamulin saline was issued daily at occlusion and placed on a toned skin for up to 7 days.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect liver) in children between one and 15 years that are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient temperature, Ambirix is used within a framework of two doses, whereby protection against Hepatitis B may possibly only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccination may be led at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired to Hepatitis A or B, Ambirix may be given or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have an effect by bringing the immune system (the natural defying of the body), "as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the Twinrix System since 1996 and has been approved for Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered for children under one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix include identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults, also as testament to the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed one month after the last injection of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix looks at between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar at a sea level and at a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injecting location, redness, matity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient may not be used in patients who may not be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or Neomycin (an antibiotic) to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted the GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for inclusion of Ambirix all over the world</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardial plan for the Grundimminisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose agreed between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher is desired both for Hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovous vaccines or with a compromise.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B- surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies lie in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully secured, whether immutable competent persons, who have addressed to a Hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher as protection, as they are also protected at no longer verifiable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection molds should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine corresponding possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardial scheme is recommended with the combination machine that contains 360 ELISA units formalinable hepatitis-A-Virus and 10 µg recombinable viral hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">At the theft of patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, under circumstances there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies, so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since a intraday injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to an optimal impact success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However with Thrombozytopenie or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected to be subcutaneous, as in these cases, intramuscular gift can come to bleeding.</seg>

<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of Grundimminisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies could be proven at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The investigational immuno campaign against both antigens was comparable to that which, after vaccination of 3 doses, with a compromise-based Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface antigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- up to including 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBS antibodies to be compared 24 months after immunisation in 0-6- months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since issuing the first permit for marketing authorisation, CHMP opinion that the benefit risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">As Ambirix not only has been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this drug is limited due to small patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with indema enzyme defective or with hypammonolitic Encephalopathy (brain damage, as a result of high ammoniacular decentrations) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided - divided into several individual pants at meals - swallowed through the food or via a pub stoma (through the abdomen into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal sonde (through the nose into the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonaps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo (a placebo medicine, i.e. without real substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also cause loss of loss in blood, depression, irritation, headaches, impotence, impotence or taste version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Human Advisory Board (CHMP) reached the conclusion that ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "as due to the rarity of the disease, there is only limited information on this medicine at the time of authorisation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients in which a full enzyme lack is already manifested in the newborn age (within the first 28 life-age).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late maniac form (including enzyme defect, which manifests after the first life of life), there is an indication of the use when in the amnese a hyperammony encephalopathy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with lockiness is AMMONAPS also available in granite form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account protections and the necessary daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose Natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early maniac lack of carbamide phosphate synthetase or ornithinkable transcarbylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an arginine appuccinatsynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dosing of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be administered in patients with looptic disorders, since there is a risk to the emergence of ocular hogany when the tablets enter not immediately in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyylbutyat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure, or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and oils.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Da metabolishing and excretion of sodium polyylbutyrian occurs via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure can only be used with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutters Gabe of phenylacetate at young roar in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neural multiplication and a heightened loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a wasted maturation of zerebrals synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be observed if phenylacetate is eliminated with humans into the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation period is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS joined in 56% of patients at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year old anortic patient, which developed a metabolic endorsement, severe hypokalmia, severe hypokalmia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose stood at a 5-month old toddler with a predictable single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, that showed a dose of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosislimiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic compound that conidered by acetyelling with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is eliminated through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is not comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess rogen nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be presumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis starts early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early maniac form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost infantist, and the disease resulted in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stud-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By uenalysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds (sodium polyylacetate), protriumbenzoate and Natriumphenylacetate), protriumbenzoate and natural substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of newborns at postpartal (however within the first month of life) to diagnose illnesses to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first emergence of a hyperammony encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many too mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac form of the condition (including feminine patients with the heterozygothic form of the ornithinkable transacbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonographic encephalopathy and subsequently were treated permanently with sodium polyylbutyrat and a protectable diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conserving in liver and kidney disease with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolism in plasma and urine were given after gin of a single dose of 5 g sodium polyylbutyrat with liver disease and liver cirrhosis after individual, as well as repeated gifts of oric doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous gases (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oral dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma-concentric formations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for treatment of adult patients with "acute Koronarsyndromes" (ACS, decreased blood sugar to the heart), for example with instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardium (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (a anomalous measurement with the electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is applied to prevent blood clots in patients who will undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow and raise the effectiveness of PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients attended the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox at all types or combined with a glycorotein-IIb / IIIA-Inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) with the conventional compbinder treatment with heetin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>

<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single stud gift from Angiox was not studied and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) to 225 second, a second shaft of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should be made.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstructed and diluted medicine before the use carefully mixed and the Bolusdosis is rapidly administered by intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, a further surveillance is no longer required, provided that 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney problems (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), should be a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients may be monitored during the treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though PCI-patients under Bivalirudine occur most blood tests on arterial score points, can undergo from patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during the treatment in principle everywhere blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR-value (International standardization (International standardization) should be considered to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bivalirudine, once again reached before the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Proceeding from the knowledge of the drug mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or Thrombozytenshemmer) may be presumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood.</seg>

<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinor, which binds both the catalytic center as well as the Anionenclosure region of Thrombin, regardless of whether it is tied to Thrombine in the liquid phase or at Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The attachment of Bivalirudine at Thrombin, and with that its effect, is reversible, since Thrombon hand splits the bond of Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thus creating the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerated.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, it was caused by Bivalirudine with serum of patients, in which it has come to heet-induccytopenie / heetininduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS), which induce no throtary aggregation-reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, young people and children from six years with diabetes that need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, which is injected the thighs or the upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose piegels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin insulin is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it affects more quickly and has a shorter activity than a short-effective Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a lengthy insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type-2 diabetes, in which the body is ineffective in non-effective, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of concentration of the substance glycosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type-1 diabetes was established after six months a reduction of 0.14% (of 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin gene.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes, lowering of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human standard insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or one of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is considered to be subcutaneous injections either in the area of the abdomen, the skyline or the deluskels or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and the diminished amount of insulin the insulin can be impacted in patients with a restriction of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in force, the brand (Her-), the insulin (normal, NPH, galvanizing, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or producer method can draw a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the demolition of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoaziosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin or insulin should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin and can therefore change at the switching of the Achema.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that can enhance blood sugar-sugar activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia, include oral antidiabetic, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, fibrate, Pentanodisyllin, propoxyphen, Salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathizolytics such as Betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and Reserpin the symptoms of adrenched counter regulation will be discouraged or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal's experimental studies on Reproductive Toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natural development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin detach to the human mother's milk, but in general insulin is neither absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorted after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the derived from clinical studies known as unfavourable pharmaceutical goods, grouped according to system organic classes and ordered by decreasing number of their appearance (very frequent: 12.1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (incidence on the basis of the incessorno data is negligible).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, fear, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, benevolence, excessive dog, changes of vision, headaches, nausea and heartbeat.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is failed to change the injecting location within the injecting range, can occur in the sequence of a lipodystrophy on the injecting location.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with awareness can be given by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg) that is given by a trained person or by intravenous gases by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urrency of the heavy hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar level by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by the inhibitor of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutters Gaelbe of insulin delivery occurs faster and the real time is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes, insulin showed a dose of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg one for the dose of disproportionate power consumption, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower increase in the glucose level effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin insulin has twice as fast efficiency as normal human insulin and achieves the complete draught joint effect approximately 2 hours earlier than Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was apparent that in an application of insulin delivery in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable, glycaemic control is reached as with human standard insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin insulin was achieved in 2 minutes before the meal - was achieved better on-scale control than with human standard insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is wasted in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control as with humanised standard insulin, which is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
