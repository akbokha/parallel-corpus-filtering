to display the DO@@ M Tree Over@@ view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; then choose a new window with the DO@@ M shown below . as a default , the display begins with the root mark of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; it represents another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / Directory of local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbols and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ y folder hierarch@@ ies by means of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle , whose surface must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or a folder , the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified in it . accordingly , large files , even can be easily detected if they can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the tre@@ et@@ ting representation represents a rec@@ tan@@ gle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . to simplify navigation possess the right corner meaningful color and fittings .
the colour of a triangle , which is switched on view color mode , can be either depth for easy detection of the shar@@ pen@@ ing table or the illustration of a different file name such as name , owners , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder . for each property you can specify if enough space to be present or whether the surface area may occur by limitations when signs of the Tre@@ vor ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of lab@@ eling in the rec@@ tan@@ gle .
with Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item . at the Tre@@ at in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be observed . please note that less space is lost for the frame if the rec@@ tan@@ gle is square meter .
as division of the area of an entry for sub@@ ordinate entries is made , the implementation remains up . here it is necessary for the lab@@ eling and the prevention of space losses through the frame always advantageous the areas that arise as square . the best methods in this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive second .
you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu item view . instead , a smo@@ ker pattern is drawn into the area of the higher level of entries to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for use K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .

how you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h decoder and ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera lens is provided to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ tised ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by means of g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and any card reading which is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the camera will also be implemented as a disk drive . the interface can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can also be used in conjunction with the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; use the program g@@ Photo 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which also supports an increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transmission of images to digital cameras and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slowly outdated ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support , so that EX@@ IF support is not read by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support does not exist in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be able to disc@@ ard nothing or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to check out is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; the Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the objective is to provide modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier to complement &amp; digi@@ tization ; by writing a small module to supplement a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; ourselves perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and drop of pictures everywhere : you can put an image in another section of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , above the horizontal separation line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file size allows you to recover the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ view . thus , the fil@@ tering works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind is displayed symbols . what fields can you configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ ign .

&amp; digi@@ tization ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this enables it to compare pictures by comparing these sig@@ natures . the less the difference between two images , the more correspond to them . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by means of a spon@@ ge , the result can be enlarged or down@@ sized . if you move a picture of somewhere over the icon of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then this will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand color sketch : record a fast sketch and &amp; digi@@ tised ; find the right pictures . here , a spon@@ ge can be set .
this rider is available for intuitive search@@ engines based on the Mar@@ ble Mini program . you can press the mouse button in or out zo@@ oming , or move it . move C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button in order to pull a square . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this sets out to include your pictures ti@@ o data .

&amp; digi@@ tised , a lumin@@ ous in a separate window available with which you can easily compare pictures . it works with all supported image files , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ ous can be added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light menu and open its window . when you are back in the window , you can easily open the bul@@ b fast with L extras .
from the thumb@@ bar you can drag the pictures that you like to compare in the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . a small arrow indicates which copy can be displayed in which window range . if you want to sync the tool@@ bar and execute the zoo or de@@ port@@ ations on one of the pictures , then they will compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to record quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise navig@@ ating from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the fields to display . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a number of similar images to work .
naturally , the normal holes are also working directly from the lumin@@ ous as for example F@@ 4 file mach@@ ining ....
all picture @-@ information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ ous . this makes it easy to link visually differences with expos@@ ures data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you disc@@ ern to the crossed paths . to preview the visible area of the picture , you must click them and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works exactly as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom controller under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ oming in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital stock administration - apart from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital invent@@ ories looked after each part of the process follows after the image has been made , sc@@ anned or digital photos records a form of digital invent@@ ories . most of us do this in a systematic and efficient way .

met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition data , information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you don &apos;t even know more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t know &amp; digi@@ tization ; . the approach allows met@@ adata to store both in a database and in the image files guaranteed very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you have to manage something inside your system . you need to decide whether you want to store other access to your computer , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; notice that you must change to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found throughout your memory location . if you would like enough photos , then your sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. publishing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option met@@ adata to save in the site of met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tization . this makes sure that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? to create a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now select every photo key@@ word , not@@ ables and a review . of course , you can select all pictures that you &apos;ll need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best pictures in the future .
let &apos;s now with keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or category . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import kat@@ alogue images from another source of embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ tization ; automatically the tree for you build or put the pictures to the right place . the revers@@ ing of the Hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub@@ tree onto another . the changed keywords are from &amp; digi@@ tization ; updated while it per@@ secuted the trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata can be cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata consists in truth from many sections . data @-@ names and calendar data are qualities of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section relates to references or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you don &apos;t want to let your photos just see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , space .
and now I say to you this the landing stage of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y the 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is re @-@ present , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ ri@@ fication has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who look at your photos is probably more important than the image to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help Him via the motif you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength to work only with an accus@@ ation for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can use any amount of text in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as marking . you can even export it for a selection of pictures . if you export your images in web @-@ galleries , then these sign@@ ments will be exported to your wishes in the marking and / or the title of the Web @-@ gallery system .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation can now already be loaded with speed .
the possibilities to take advantage of the ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alization are already un@@ coun@@ table and can be repeated in the future by means of pictures with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ tization ; can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information left :
author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , such as the name of a company or organization . after which this value was saved , it should no longer be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
title : link with the author . this field contains the working @-@ drawing of the photographer . examples of this may be titles as : cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out of the same as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the agent to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily need to be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency is listed here .
it is important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they don &apos;t have any protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than base know in working with calcul@@ ators , delete or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ mark . for individuals , this is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . now , in the near future , such module can be made available for the st@@ acking processing .

of course we didn &apos;t talk about CDs that lost on the road or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must also buy CDs and DVDs within archi@@ val quality . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality . of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe this is in your surve@@ ying room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and put them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns to select the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just written only . therefore , use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ at@@ ting and control . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ul@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs . however , there are also similar applications available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard disk , flash drive , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ War against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layout DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is naturally also true for Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . likewise , if you store the media with a description , date &amp; author mark@@ ers and thereafter on a clean , dark dry and outside animals protected place . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing erg@@ ers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the troubles@@ hooting of hard drives : dis@@ miss@@ able study
shortly : dis@@ ks stay at the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ate area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . in case of lower temper@@ ament , these errors will not notice the immediate accident . some of SM@@ ART announce the immediate im@@ pending failure . these are in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and Ver@@ lag@@ o@@ zäh@@ ler . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the whole loss of loss due to strain . of course , you can also use data loss due to an electric razor before saving the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account much , that can cause serious harm . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware age , non @-@ destructive mother@@ boards , and other defects . thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that has absorbed a part of the energy heat and ob@@ tainable the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . keep in mind that not every plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as a transm@@ itter of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be careful that also all peri@@ pher@@ als connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage swit@@ cher , which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations into the electric lines , it will help you with a complete failure . even a fall of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a fragile electricity supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ tension these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . some models allow them to even continue working until the stream again . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life @-@ time of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concerns you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be you for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected too . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions therefore only exist as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general security solution . for this reason , it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not be able to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version will make you more available , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory what should be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data security , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically measured thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a shared memory . this means that they are dis@@ ast@@ er@@ sure .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transmis@@ sions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred to you . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you have a photo open and this to your surprise is destroyed . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data away than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power components are another source of transmission losses , since they generate interference within the data streams . in ordinary file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already , 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to handle and scal@@ eable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it will soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available in English .
Oracle launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mach@@ inations the z@@ fs used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data loss in the notebook and 46 % in the workplace @-@ systems . at not@@ ebooks , the percentage of th@@ ef@@ ts are 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most meth@@ ists think . it results in a lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has long been sighted a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than EX@@ T@@ 3 , cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common fil@@ esystem . a very good English article for this can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 Bl@@ en@@ den@@ settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are not far away from this limit .
current cameras are heading towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ ene sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this back before you do anything that &apos;s the re@@ installation of your OS , the exchange of disks or the magnitude of hard disk .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster proposes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft un@@ happiness : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ backs is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups out the stairs up into the neighboring house , in your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data in spite of securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference security : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last end of the end system . creates a complete snapshot of up to two periods : that of the full backup and the latest difference of difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple times . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup is made . this protection comes with a version@@ ing system the next one with the exception that it is only de@@ ta@@ xed and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ cription copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security regarding ssh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
this approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; ries ; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly entry for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , association , storage , scal@@ ability , media , play@@ back of images and met@@ adata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , view@@ points , ... , use of the internet .
doing so valuable pictures the next 40 year to survive that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
as the future due to your nature unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate throughout the time . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vigil@@ ance . all 5 @-@ 8 years should you ask yourself how the current system is backwards . the less variations you have used in the past , the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the subject to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have plans to enlarge the scal@@ ability and extend the area that you want to enlarge click on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but do not depend on them .

open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software you can read , then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format disappears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard developed by G@@ IF . however , it can save much more . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ m@@ ity data for an improved colour assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage , that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF required and have a slow @-@ slow result . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very big files . with some cameras , you can save your pictures in this format . a problem is , however , that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G has been developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use met@@ adata . a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nik@@ on team at some time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has installed its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers exercise it in front of an original of your shot , mostly in rough format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP fits , as it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think if you use DN@@ G as a container and place everything there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata , which include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tened efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata &apos;s standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reading or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edit , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your Roh@@ archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a more subtle processing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have been cut down by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ eria , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the section of adding a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos , which you already have on your hard drive , but you can add many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it into . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , one heel indicator appears at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will display . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information on each entry . using the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an item or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photographic information stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the image does not have been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , Produc@@ tions , GPS etc . of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . please note that these met@@ adata are not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download , and then download the choice of all . this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised ; . while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can select only the desired videos settings from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download the select button until you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is new download now . these images have not yet been downloaded by &amp; digi@@ tised ; in this case , the new pictures have been marked with a star in the curtain window . if you choose this option , you will of course download the new pictures .
if you choose to download the buttons all download or select a dialog , displayed in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is displayed , displayed in the section My albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tization ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by delete the button Del@@ ete . if you only want to delete a few , you must select them first and delete it by er@@ asing .
note that there are no possibility to restore your camera from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; so they should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a &amp; beta release ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should do this over the camera , since this is much faster .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once again , if you load photos of different recording spots in the same album . therefore , it can be sensible to integrate the date and time on which the picture was made to be integrated into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ e@@ based sub@@ stit@@ ches . if you use this latter option , automatically a folder is created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate to the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different file format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y@@ - % % - % H : % S : change the option date &amp; time . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the command line .
if you use the camera data file , you will have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small case letters . or in case letters if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ came ; for a photo , it is displayed below the name that the camera will be available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ tised , all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform at the time point of recording . not all cameras represent this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation off , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera records information about the date when the photo is made available , it can be updated to download automatically under@@ clock in the target album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ tised ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this option , use the button Advanced and select the option dating back at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos of their computer is to download their camera , is to download the button . then select a file text , you can select the files up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Metho@@ ds .
once the selection has been completed , asks &amp; digi@@ tised ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . the identification of data can be indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude , and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to pol@@ ling an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can click with a click of a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised , users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to save the posi@@ tional data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and map refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , through a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files using the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic attri@@ bution ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver . but there are a few that work with GPS recipients to work together . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ asset Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; ps@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com to show no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , who show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; try to change as much control over its working procedures as possible . to modify these settings , you have to set up in Settings . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
action can be displayed at embedded Preview or picture editing . you therefore place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; note when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ identity and copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected when downloading from camera lens . even when downloading synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author@@ ship is a syn@@ onym for editor : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations , such as employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , it must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the picture of the photo . this does not have to be the author as this is the image other &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo ; then the group or agency should be enumer@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the appropriate IP@@ TC rim . it is achieved that the met@@ adata constantly contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ tised , without getting lost .
images save as embedded trig@@ gers ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with which in the pictures were included . attention : in pictures that have already ri@@ dden already , these may be over@@ written by the photographs .
the page settings contains all the options for the information they appear , when mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the main window appears on a file . depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ tization came ; if any file in a &amp; digi@@ came ; Albu@@ quer@@ ner , which has no such extensions , from &amp; digi@@ came ; ignored .
default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Re@@ fresh from any category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ous of &amp; digi@@ tization ; however , if you then access the default values , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get better machines . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , the picture editing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the picture editing , this inspection can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , the images are coded into a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in colour formations . please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation .
with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG used a los@@ s@@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and un@@ packing . if you have a rapid calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TI@@ FF files you can turn the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sing muscle for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss works .
with the setting up @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save losses . even if you choose the los@@ sy approach , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was still not supported , but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the picture editing only an image editor for photos . currently , it develops quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of picture editing .
the standard ann@@ ul@@ fs is that all green pixels are identical . if the ger@@ ad@@ line green pixel of the C@@ CD @-@ sensor , this difference generates a minimum loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option features the picture a little soft , but eliminated the 2@@ x@@ 2 g@@ aves patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white pattern is not set , default , it is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps will get more details on the edge @-@ edge . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the default it is the sh@@ ot@@ ters , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in , because of the in@@ capacity of your camera re@@ boot the cutting @-@ edge , as they indicate the cutting @-@ edge in several Ros@@ at@@ rains . lastly , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ws to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast secular as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w thus try to re@@ construct the missing green@@ - and red shar@@ ehol@@ es from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much colour or wh@@ ites you want .
selecting the option to construct a level , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image .
set the L@@ umin@@ ous according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tised ; picture editing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor that have many cameras and that has a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; and D@@ cra@@ w present you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it produces farms in edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you &apos;re looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your lenses you can set the red and blue @-@ proo@@ fre@@ aders here . this is certainly the best method for a color error correction , as you are implemented during the shell .
a profile translated the color formations and prints instructions like this again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tised ; information such as the color formations of a color brewery can be translated into the other so that colors are as accurate as possible .
behaviour Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with rough files .
color profile folder Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised , these folders then examine during Star@@ ts .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; default squ@@ el@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the white file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images colored not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you are using . not all profiles are included in the same type . there are some such as Canon , which does not contain any color panel or gam@@ eke@@ last@@ y . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not apply for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color panel itself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile which you em@@ ulate that your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could you manually correct instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not for the models of Canon . therefore here a table of cameras and profiles they fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for scen@@ eries , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image owners and educational work . through the Deli@@ vering of this interface you can support and digi@@ tization ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then loaded from &amp; digi@@ tised . these modules also appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond .
short @-@ command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings command command .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Sli@@ deshow should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hes the time between image processes , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross@@ roads turn on the met@@ adata one or out , which ends at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties display on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . if you want to use this , you make sure that the camera is connected correctly , switched on and in the picture @-@ line mode . beneath this are the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras from the camera . you must specify the path , / m@@ elt / camera or / m@@ elt / re@@ designing , specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tization ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch them into the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ tised , the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can put cameras and port manually after you have set your camera out , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any type of name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tization ; setting up a photo in an album . in the delete of a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes due to the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without having any feedback . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also tie the message of the check @-@ screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; at the starting point , it speeds up under circumstances the start process of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
the setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos and digi@@ tised , the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this is prolonged the time @-@ time from &amp; digi@@ came ; . if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks , whether it should delete it from the database .
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected using settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs are enumer@@ ated below :
these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for check , find out more about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and fix the correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting ads / editing .
the picture editing contains a set of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the picture editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current dat@@ en@@ um@@ mer , enlar@@ ging factor and the current picture size indicates .
a menu bar on the top edge , and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of images editing your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo , before saving file or storing the button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot re@@ vert the original photo as soon as you saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be saved to file saving as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore menu or use the button re@@ producing the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose every change that you have performed on the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of picture editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting editing , or restored , by selecting editing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , c@@ tr@@ l ; Z for re@@ acting and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ bar or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar you get a single click menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navig@@ ational tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the log menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically
view Full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you want to use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can visit this in setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can view this in the checking dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised ; you can view this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; printing dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print out single images or whole sets . you &apos;ll only need to select images with standard methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ters . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page is available , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on :
multiple @-@ clicking on the same rider leaves the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the edge again .
in the marking view you can input holes with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is permitted UT@@ F @-@ 8 . that means that all special characters are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to allow you to use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are created after 2000 characters and are formed by special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC registry box in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented on , use either the button , or simply switch to the next picture , the sign@@ ments will then be saved .
next to the use button there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . however , this is always performed if you have selected a met@@ adata setting , which is always written into the pictures .
the review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting b@@ ings . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the co@@ ding follows the schema in the following table :
the sampling view displays a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously published in this &amp; digi@@ tised , session key@@ word .
the sampling tree is adjusted as a dynamic to the search word . you can easily restrict the number of options in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief for the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for fast access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ er the corresponding cross@@ roads in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , If you want to select a selection with a key@@ word , please refer to the sampling filter section .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - fil@@ en@@ - , key@@ word and view@@ points . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the cutting of these two displays . all provided keywords are available .
you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . subsequently , a dialog , which you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on No keywords , what are reduced to three pictures . they were pulled with Str@@ g + a , and after that , a key@@ word was removed from the right key@@ word on the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be switched under settings differences .
if you have a rule and created and find that it would be one or its , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in control .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is being sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , already placed in the database .
for example , you can specify a wi@@ ped search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the tick @-@ box at the end of the rule and after that the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr have not been listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . thanks to El@@ le for this work . I basically worked on &amp; digi@@ tised , s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , which have the colors available from your camera or scanner , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner , and the colors that you print or publish in the Web to those from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
when the theme comes to colour management , everyone wants to press which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria specified below , you must not worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ GB farms . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture purchases are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so when s@@ GB works so well and make life for all so easy , why should one use another color brewery and thus have thoughts about color @-@ managed ?
a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we really see will be presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB farms , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ als of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms website and then click on Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I kal@@ ine my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB farms ?
yes ! whether you are working on s@@ GB @-@ farms or not , you need to kal@@ li@@ bri@@ ds your monitor , since s@@ GB works on s@@ R@@ GB . so if you are working as in the color brewery of s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitoring profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . use it before you try a further manual work .
the functions are norm@@ alize the same , automatic , and contrast , from the menu Kor@@ sti@@ er autom@@ atic correction , trying to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ osity values over the overall picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color shades . this feature is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
the same : this method j@@ us@@ cated the lumin@@ ous factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ o@@ gram of the intensive service is as flat as possible . thus , the equivalent very good results obtained in improving the contradiction of an image , sometimes it also produces only garbage . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in one image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic Ab@@ same : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the rot@@ - , green@@ - and blue channel . it identifies the dark and bright border tones and j@@ us@@ cated the rot@@ - , green@@ - and blue channels on the entire hist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast enhancement : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by drawing the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a novel@@ ty of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ immediately of a photo .
the white @-@ tip correction is somewhat restricted as over a colour brewery with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform too far from the original image , can perform areas with over@@ exposure . in case you work the white @-@ off in the shell mode , your possibilities for correc@@ ting your correction are better .
this tool is based on a whi@@ tish ar@@ tery of the copyri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel &apos;s Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it over the menu input colors white @-@ like the image processing .
the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side are both the original image as well as preview the target image . if you want to see the original white picture again , it is enough to click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pix@@ els below this mark@@ er is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ gram .
to the right above , a hist@@ o@@ gram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ o@@ gram is very helpful since , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small L@@ umin@@ chers . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ um@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma off . the shade can be adjusted you can improve the shadow details of your photos or rec@@ lu@@ te .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture show around which selected colors for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white @-@ off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure of the pixels increase the colors , if more than a color channel of the pix@@ els is over@@ exposed . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
buttons save as and loading exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set , you can save to save in a text file and later download it later .
the button preference creates all filter values back to its default values and the associated @-@ neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original . if you save it , your original image is changed .
you can adjust the code sti@@ ckers per colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding requires also more disk space , calculation time and stands on@@ ly@@ re for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialogue as the editing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for using color profiles , you can draw the chapter colour administration at rate .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of clay correction . this tool provides an integrated path to store several color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistakes and therefore always require the same correction . in the manual for the ton@@ value error , you will find more information .
a very powerful way of correct exposure problems is the tool for re@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool paint effects presents you four color@@ effects , a solar system effect , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ oe filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar isation was also called Sab@@ ine , also Sab@@ ati@@ er . the colored , dark areas sheltered from the extra light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . this tool was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine .
the intensity control the solar isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase creates finally a neg@@ ativity that is not to generate on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation that it makes a stronger contradiction @-@ effect , which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light @-@ optimized color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colours are also a few photographers , especially those who are scar@@ cely scenic , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light in contrast edge . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ ly@@ ts . in large pictures the filter can choose the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to review the color counter and illumin@@ ating the photos . you can preview the different shades of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you can make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big sati@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will reduce the good choice for sati@@ ety instead of raising them . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes made with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple upright / contrast / Gamma the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ der . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity values , an Hist@@ o@@ gram , the active canal or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene , three sli@@ ders are inserted into it and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to postp@@ one the regul@@ ators and take care of how the image changes .
on the right side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the Hist@@ o@@ gram is frequently displayed with a linear or logistical y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic use will be more useful .
three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three colours pin@@ p@@ allets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically j@@ us@@ ite the shade of the shade , middle and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
ga@@ war@@ es allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two Reg@@ ulators that can be used to change the ga@@ stri@@ te interactive as in the intervention rate . the compression of the exit status can be used for example , to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture .
save as and load : using these buttons , the data set in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and later re@@ activated . in addition , the Gimp is used format .
if you use this mode and the three colour p@@ allets , the input holes will be re @-@ reviewed for all the shade , means and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for red , green@@ - , blue - and the L@@ umin@@ ator channels .
the option over@@ exposure of indi@@ col@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview , and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the intervention rate applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the ga@@ ga@@ rated are unchanged . the original image is with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side the half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modifications Canal : this selection box allows to indicate the channel that is changed by the module :
beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly generated . for pictures with large areas of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
if you , for example , move a short panel to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with darker pron@@ o@@ uns , and that the associated images are darker .
in the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er in the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move up and down until the value is placed according to your taste .
save as and load : using these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you have created may be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp cur@@ format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ allets buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , central and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the rot@@ - , green@@ - , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the option over@@ exposed indi@@ col@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is a indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview , and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous canal . shadow and Sundays has been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mix@@ er is another advanced tool to mix the colors of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er the image processing .
with the channel box , you can select the color for the Hist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing . the original section of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed to compare your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ o@@ gram to show you the appropriate color value .
controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ators for red , green and construction allow you to activate these channels . if you activate le@@ aning , the image will retain the overall brightness , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color will appear to a visible noise which does not appear at the same place in the color canal . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ ment conversion thereby in which you will reduce the color @-@ brewery first .
the saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender @-@ setting can therefore save it for later and then load . this file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure of indi@@ col@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview , and it is not an effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel has been re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction . with the development of digital photography , black / white a working progress , since color models can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ers profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a green liner filter . this looks good , in all the scene images and fits especially well with portraits against heaven . so much like the 00@@ 4 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) .
orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a orange liner filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus similar to the 00@@ 2 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
red filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a red Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic down@@ times and can simul@@ ate the moon @-@ time for day @-@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates an black / white film exposure with a yellow lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural shade of color and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones as it adds up a bit of cold in the shaft . this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 Co@@ kin ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; checking , tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry picture texture the image processing can be used for it .
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool frame can add a decorative framework to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative box . this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye . under picture frames , the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter set up the desired frame for your picture . thoroughly , the picture comple@@ tes with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , picking up it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ator and decorative stit@@ uting a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range area for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame designed target image will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ at@@ ted text in an image at any spot . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text message , orientation , color from the color dimension and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . the larger the picture , the larger the character size must be . at the end , just choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already , the picture is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; any approach that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool sten@@ cil , you can put a sten@@ cil over an image .
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one is used in image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils over an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and you should add with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to de@@ file the file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil of de@@ file ; just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ came ; mailing list checking came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for a first time , you need to set your template folder with the button basis folders . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils was published a tree @-@ view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ abl@@ on@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ bar of the template automatically .
the preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the underlying image . if you want to apply the mouse on the full picture , you must reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired location .
just use OK if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your image . the image is then automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ tised , three different tools for the edge is available . each one of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed , a traditional tool is a sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
in@@ shar@@ fe mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . indeed , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ca@@ vern@@ s and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution are adjusted to a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally need more toler@@ ating than normal cameras for the private application .
with JP@@ EG pictures , it is often applied to a camera of internal shar@@ pen@@ ing . images in the shell format must always be used during processing .
some sc@@ anners turn a sharp@@ est filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable them , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can obtain usable results by calling a photo with the edge of shar@@ pen@@ ing throwing . that can call you with the menu @-@ entry Kor@@ rigi@@ dity .
but you should deal with caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the most suitable technology is re@@ focus on the tool fr@@ re@@ focus . you can re@@ focus it on the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ dity . among re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharp@@ ens .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than sharp@@ ens . use the tool to so@@ fter with the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ dly and experiment with settings . the default window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter blur@@ red mas@@ cot is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can you see here .
the original image and preview help the picture to process . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in radius or amount reinforce the effect . if you make the bl@@ ister mask too strong , craw@@ ling and get the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ os . you should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the spon@@ ge value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and applying differential . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ing and thus beauty errors avoided in faces , cel@@ les and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working image that ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a value = 0.@@ 0 applied .
the &amp; digi@@ came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the protected protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ focus a picture . this is better approach than just trying the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus on a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus mostly better results as a bl@@ ur mask . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus in image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche barrel . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche barrel has a very long tail , which leads the mathematical result from the source pixel that is far from the original tor@@ ch pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular bas@@ spl@@ its . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is blur@@ red but then to hal@@ es .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help thereby reduce arti@@ facts . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smokers should help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , the filter can help values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.@@ 1 can be beneficial . however , if the smoking filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still consume the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche focal : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use these parameters as your in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid out@@ ger@@ ent arti@@ facts . if you use a value in@@ equal zero , you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the smo@@ ker filter .
Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the Transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ atri@@ x . however , an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great value for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ing or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen . however , note that the module will be very slow when you choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then .
try to perform all cuts , color and Inten@@ sity jacket on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but left later un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts .
if you want to read images and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Mas@@ c@@ ant produces better results than sharp@@ ens . this could be caused by bl@@ ur a larger neighbourhood than sharp@@ ness .
theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king ever needs to generate ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never able to show the effect of in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filters . it is practically the result of the F@@ IR Wiener filter at least as good as the bl@@ ister mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture was taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to an insufficient light to the Auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of ac@@ entr@@ al correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ tte sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area which was bl@@ acked out to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color @-@ tin@@ ts allows a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set it here .
the tool image error error is one of the most widely developed tools to remove the desired ar@@ te@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ dies algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as star@@ tup points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are enumer@@ ated below :
if you want to f@@ use the fil@@ tering settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detailed dra@@ inage p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a higher gra@@ dient of the image . weigh@@ ed up greater values mainly homo@@ geneous regions and details . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be given details such that no focal point should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated , always under the direction of addiction , should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
ri@@ dding addiction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even@@ ly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ation or C@@ CD noise will produce a high value wav@@ y pattern . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts are best removed at a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum reduction factor above all@@ el@@ ong@@ p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore place this value up to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , as it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects it has to be set higher than 3 .
re@@ ps : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally there is 1 or 2 out .
angle @-@ step there &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha small is chosen , there should be small angle a long run . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step of step &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels gra@@ ding and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More to quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low . but he doubles its running time . we recommend him to let him out .
buttons save as and loading exactly this . every setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later re@@ charged .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load after it . hence , you can cancel calculation at any time with the demo@@ lition .
below you can see how picture bugs have been corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied to a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar black list during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; drug reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool sets out sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensory input from the camera or mo@@ tions ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor parts of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular smo@@ ker that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can convert the image . the area specified by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is harv@@ ested and thus yield minor errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the focal point . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ut the filter to be as@@ certain@@ ed . if it is increased , you may change the edges filter if you change this attitude . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer get the noise or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge @-@ accuracy of the fil@@ tering . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or noise @-@ tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a s@@ watch@@ ful noise or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process which is controlled by the details controls .
colour : controls the color @-@ tolerant of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ th@@ ness process which is controlled by the details controls .
Gamma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker ranges which are typically more consuming , to increase . however , it also tended the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the alignment of Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted . if he is increased to high , noise and phosph@@ itter may occur at the edges . he can remove drugs and is the recommended method for it .
save under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set may be saved into fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and that corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoking reduction was applied with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too scar@@ fs for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to so@@ fter with the menu application cor@@ rigi@@ dly and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the shelf @-@ window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo @-@ quality products .
these filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts about your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove palate , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sive images , compres@@ sing , compres@@ sive , compres@@ sing images , and thus gets the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text replacement . using a different tool , the image error correction , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ ca &apos;s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compres@@ sion@@ ism , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed image . this attitude will correct these problems .
buttons save as and loading exactly this . every setting from photo recovery can be saved into a text file and later re@@ charged .
photo recovery is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load after it . hence , you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce as a photo with flat @-@ shaped smoking . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and that corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo recovery . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the sc@@ ann@@ ess lighting and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos taken with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms of the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ lop .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw material photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the button . the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by C@@ CD Def@@ ective .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to correc@@ ting the picture . an automatic processing of the dark is to find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the last stop and this automatically invites you to the next session .
the picture area and preview help you correct the result within the picture . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all the fields of view .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pix@@ el@@ sticks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting colour will be assigned to all broken pixels on the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a gap of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less about Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels on the block .
Kub@@ ic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is under ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization : vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
for@@ esi@@ ble lenses , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the whole sensor area . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ lenses show under certain circumstances also this behavior .
but he also has disadvantages . many Center filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 in the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . further angle @-@ objective should also use with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise im@@ measur@@ ably effects caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ing areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tering and color @-@ scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ence transformation by using a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copyri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light foam p@@ adding at the point of the biggest density the filter . the default density is 2.@@ 0 , which gives an optical filter with a bl@@ ending attitude of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , un@@ pre@@ dominant , reduce it to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and Gamma @-@ settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ command the expos@@ ures of the target image with these options . the Reg@@ ulators show you only positive values since you just need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er turn@@ around of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) displays the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a leu@@ ch@@ astic and contradiction correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tion cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ des treated the general geom@@ etric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar broad@@ ening effect , fla@@ wed but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corners to the part of the second gra@@ der . if you combine these two can be eliminated with geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ des . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of the ver@@ ular distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the engra@@ ver . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters has the reverse parameters of the parameter General .
z@@ oom : this value scale up the image size and thus leads to a correction to the first degree of gra@@ der by . negative values scale down while positive the image increases .
brigh@@ ten : this value j@@ us@@ hes the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the di@@ alogs with a preview the distor@@ tion error . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ - or cus@@ p @-@ shaped correction should be performed in front of all cuts or sizes . the best way to cut this correction as the first one . if you make a picture anew , and then perform a ton@@ ic correction , the effect is obvious .
to help you find the best correction . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the picture show around the dot@@ ted lines . move it into an important place , such as the bottom or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . following you can fix the ton@@ gs / pad @-@ shaped distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a pad @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can use it with the cutting @-@ tool in the menu to remove it from image processing or using the z@@ oom controller of this dialogue .
for most pictures the barrel @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of ton@@ ed @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating inf@@ rar@@ ed film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a awareness area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
on the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters for top @-@ gra@@ ins and film@@ making ( ISO ) . activate the color of the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of footage and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) as a transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
as the filter colors for re@@ producing inf@@ rar@@ ed movie , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour formations are missing .
this is an example of inf@@ rar@@ ed fil@@ tering , applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ ins .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter movies , is an easy to use tool to reproduce footage onto your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed movies like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . in order to increase the sensitivity of movies , the manufacturer &apos;s major silver @-@ gra@@ ins of phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film @-@ body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specifically in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , so you must use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gra@@ ins are calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of film @-@ gra@@ ding effects applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the working ( 2 ) . this used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil gem@@ s generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter oil gem@@ s gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top chooses the brush @-@ size between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better controlled for big images . smooth brus@@ hes controlled the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the scar@@ ce .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is with the ( 1 ) and the working is characterized by the ( 2 ) . brush @-@ size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and glasses 17 .
the &amp; checking came ; Filter coal @-@ drawing is used colour and Inten@@ sity to create a carbon shaft . the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing , therefore , if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you . these would be good pictures to start .
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator chooses the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adapting the intensity value even further .
the &amp; checking came ; Filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; Filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to turn the image into a gray , demon@@ ic landscape .
the depth does not allow the contrast to the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wav@@ el@@ sticks 1 , the image here is distor@@ ted to a different version of glass bl@@ acks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by using im@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ ggy lines that comes from a central point . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al in@@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by rotation of the pixels to a central point . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a rotating camera .
distance @-@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture to create the effect of an un@@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion In@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : caught the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed movements of a linear , z : B : from a car or train photographed camera .
soft @-@ resistant oun@@ ces : caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our @-@ photos or add a warm and subtle inc@@ and@@ escent .
bulk @-@ sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates thereby the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbitrary camera .
intelligent discomfort : finds the color sink in the image and caught this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , by filling with an average pix@@ el@@ value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice small tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a fun appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n ghted material algorithm .
trou@@ gh size allows to change the size of the picture . since the dri@@ pping size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . fishing changes the visual effect of drops in the picture .
you can keep an area free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es with the &amp; digi@@ tization . use the tool tool to select the area , e.g. a face that shall remain free of charge . if you start the filter check @-@ in , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es Fil@@ ters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the working image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu of transform@@ ing turning or transforming mir@@ rors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to smaller out is simple . the big question is how you can blow up an image and hold the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try to infl@@ ate the tool .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are enumer@@ ated below :
the aspect ratio is maintained : if this setting is enabled , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio is maintained by the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ ther , as it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects it has to be set higher than 3 .
buttons are saved as and charging are used exactly to it . each inser@@ tion for photo magni@@ fy can be saved as text file and later re@@ charged .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast at what it does , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after it . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo bub@@ bles by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard En@@ lar@@ gement to compare .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly underestimated tool to put together a picture . in order to cut a photo , you simply need to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rec@@ tan@@ gle , then you will see this rec@@ tan@@ gle while you move the mouse .
if you want to release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . thus , you will get a good overview of how your photo will change after cutting the area by moving to the corners of the square . you can create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut @-@ section , use the button The access button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File save under the menu file to save the newly cro@@ pped photo .
in the field of view , you can change the size of the square by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains to be preserved .
in accordance with aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their side ratio .
at the right end of the di@@ alogs , two buttons exist around the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically to center .
below in dialogue with the max . relation to the area to cut the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizon horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the access tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data are reflected in the EX@@ IF data and not the original image .
the settings of the work @-@ aid help allow for help to put your pictures better together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of the similarity . like the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to form a rec@@ tan@@ gle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
Golden center : the Golden center is a division which is on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the bl@@ et@@ ters of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all possible things that we feel as nice .
the Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used in ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures . the escap@@ ing divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually followed by visually , harmonious .
the Golden Center provides liquid relief lines if you put an image together . these help are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal good results for your photos . in comparison to the third el@@ re@@ gel creates the golden spiral , a liquid line that leads through the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etric visu@@ als .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden Cor@@ rec@@ tan@@ gles . it should be something that the eye looks at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or just being there without the eye it will fulfil its task .
the Golden triangles also depend on the top @-@ discussed golden spiral . keep in mind that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equ@@ in@@ kling triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal of these lines may place a static object more dynamic .
if you are using golden triangles to break up your frame , create an effect that is called by professional photographers &apos;s dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options horizontal direc@@ tional and vertical flip can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ aries can be invisible . this way you can custom@@ ize the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any corner .
if you make a photo then it happens easy that you don &apos;t keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; image processing and tool free rotation . choose to do this trans@@ former free rotation and j@@ us@@ ite the target angle .
rot@@ ate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are in degrees specified . with the button preference you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the spin is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side .
for your help , the module is free rotation of a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the picture show around the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ tate the angle as described in previous section .
once you have turned an image you will find some unwanted holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function transforming it out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing wir@@ es the picture a bit after rotation . please note the above @-@ mentioned warning .
all the prospective transformations are performed to a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation are in pixel .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel .
angle on the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle to degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have the perspective , you get unbe@@ arable holes in the corners . one way of getting this to ber@@ some is to cut the image by trans@@ figured out of the image processing .
the tool @-@ tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and shift the other part to the opposite . this is not a rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle is turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module about transformation .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal corner and vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press preference , the angle will be displayed at zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the switching tool to j@@ us@@ tate your image .
after you have carried out the shot , the image will be caught a bit . for a single shot , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots em@@ powering twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after switching the picture has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image by trans@@ figured out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; required a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iles . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats in this place . however , you will always be able to find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ tised , only files in formats used to the list . this happens according to file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is displayed in the list . you can edit this list of file exten@@ ders that change &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration , you can find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras will even allow you to select the format . a ful@@ ler description of these file formats you can find in Wikipedia . and digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sive procedures to digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally , there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JP@@ EG , in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the Roh@@ a format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous club and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert media format images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . in the section configuration , you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization ; .
&amp; digi@@ tised , the loading of raw materials only supports with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came in &amp; digi@@ tised . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of shell formats used by &amp; digi@@ tization ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . however , these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG file ; but it is not a film processing program and therefore does not feature any built @-@ in options to display or edit . if you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies to start playing the program .

many tools that you need the photo editing may be in &amp; digi@@ tised ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft @-@ op@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur , un@@ sharp , bl@@ ur , un@@ sharp , &amp; etc ; use a uniform dialog box before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . links from him allow five buttons to change the previous step @-@ area to change . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected field .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower depic@@ ts the filter to the area below the selected pres@@ et area .
vertical . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .

&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; it has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ ene with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ ene re@@ comp@@ uted and presented in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; )
menu , to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than this no@@ de )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ esh ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning when you start &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in this case the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Fin@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the lower scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select with the context menu , select a firm position of this overview or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and down without any special , left and right at pressed &amp; old ; key ) ;
Zo@@ omen is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; loaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h needs to be re@@ charged or whether you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphic viewer ... use , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; the instance ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; the instance want to open or create the graph graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the latest option you can save your choice permanently , but change it with the furnishing dialog .
at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ ene , which are to be placed on a page . thereby , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
page map with one on several pages distributed graph without head@@ line and with another font .
the page again provides the possibility to set the behavior if a file is changed on the hard drive , and eg . by another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or to ask the program each time .
opening the page opening the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session . you can set a standard behavior for that case ( the graphs in a new window or set in a sub@@ window of already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site operator gives the ability to set the grid @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as they are described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graph . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few can@@ ten@@ times as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for f@@ eri@@ ed graphs . he produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm uses the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates for f@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ ene a spring@@ y model layout . he uses the fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ length trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm prescribed the no@@ des circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialogue in which you can specify a lay@@ out@@ command , which will then print from a shell . the command should specify graph@@ ite settings as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give specific options , or even the graphs with a filter , before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or appropri@@ ated ) and uses the standard algorithm for each type of ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for discipl@@ ined graphs ) .
if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . click with this mouse @-@ cur@@ sor on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more aid to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it needs the following program packages :
a special arrangement is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in the Settings menu , you can find more options .
the main window of the Symbol Edi@@ tors is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for string tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid @-@ floor where you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards a dialog , in which you can choose whether the symbol is to be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew .
represents the last revers@@ ed step back . if you do not have a step back , this function is de@@ activated .
insert the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not match with those of the symbol @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current string color on the color of the point where you click .
the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right it displays you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current palette , the enlar@@ ging factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
insert the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images include tools available to read new pictures and save them .
this module can be used to read and retrieve new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka port to read images from a scanner that supports the SA@@ NE project or another source like video streams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
if you open the menu entries to scan images , a dialog , which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values duc@@ ts to select your picture accordingly . watch the preview and adjust the area of your needs before you sc@@ anning the picture . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
note that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings otherwise may not be displayed .
once you have pushed the button sc@@ anning , you have to wait until the scan has been completed and the window for fixing the options of the target file . here , you can specify the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the type of BM@@ P and therefore create very large files . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; choose or create the image should be saved .
screen Photos you can create after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ter - screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can adjust the different screens fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own program window is selected , the re@@ vocation program will disappear , so that you can read other screens and windows . if you read the complete work@@ space , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
once the scre@@ enshot was made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image and edit . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization makes tools available to loc@@ alise images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tude are used here .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to guide the menu above , you need to load a column file with GP@@ X file . this file contains naturally data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file loaded a automatic correlation , which lists the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and hence the camera should be revers@@ ed with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . get here your camera time zone .
the setting for the maximum period of time gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ az@@ eit . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the pictures . the time difference between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is placed in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location . since the dialog box you need to use the coordinates from a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set up with the displayed card and enlarge it . select the appropriate region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be changed manual mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ pool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will allow UT@@ F @-@ 8 to allow the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adjusted . they only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ ch@@ schau and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely created by itself . if you then click on an image , a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default picture , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show , displayed .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ AL@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original paintings will also be stored in the new pictures .
with any other color @-@ deep set you can change the default colors . the file size of course also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider curtains allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . push abor@@ ting the process to break down .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore read the program@@ y choices in order to determine if mistakes were performed during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press closing in order to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ chter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ chter allows it to view a selection of pictures and to perform on them base operations such as scrip@@ tions , zo@@ oming or p@@ ou@@ fl@@ ing . the viewer can be used with du@@ mb@@ ones and mice . it has been developed for a quick image and quick access to its features .
after starting a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG losses freely module is a tool to alter pictures without compromising quality .
this module allows to store for the actions specified below , pictures in the JP@@ EG format without the usual losses of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of color formations . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ click is a tool to connect to your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera shop currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact Mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file text dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you hit the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ er module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ er module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length , convert . this module also uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Sli@@ deshow .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide bar . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the pictures which are to be packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that , you can create the module via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images you selected are then enumer@@ ated by image files in the portfolio . there you can also modify sorting of images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . a lower value creates very sudden , a high on the contrary very smooth image @-@ changing .
the background @-@ color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . the name and path of the generated file you can specify under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it possible to keep the file mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file on the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can start creating the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or in all quiet@@ ness a coffee and enjoy the se@@ ash@@ jam when you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ding or tools are missing , you can custom@@ ize the paths to the programs of the M@@ Y@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages to adjust the settings on the right below .
the printer resistant allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sets . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened using image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your data into one of three formats of JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original part of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera records . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image window appears then in mode for a single image . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ use the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white . the essential parameters like g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be trac@@ ed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the end result . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces for it the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
in case you intend to edit your pictures frequently or you later otherwise , you should not select the JP@@ EG format , as it only allows limited number of operations before the image quality has deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JP@@ EG as a memory format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data file .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it off .
the st@@ acker mode allows you to convert multiple images at once . use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings .
the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically re@@ write . this is helpful if this has been created in a previous attempt . a preview is not available . the progress bar will show how far the conversion progress has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to compressed all pictures in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ score , and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the albums .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the picture smaller or enlarge . in addition , four types of images are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal magnitude in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , according to the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : magnitude change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate growth in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print processing : preparing the picture for the photo pressure . the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , Rand@@ stad and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the extra pictures before . other pictures can be drawn on the list of images and disc@@ ard it there .
after you have started the module , the photo window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add more pictures to the button . for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and disc@@ ard it to add the list of images to your image .
with the button images , the selected images are removed from the list of images .
once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail clients . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of your emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and every time it is used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download this here .
after the selection of comments in a hung file , the comments are added to the pictures in a text file and the mail is attached .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted under los@@ s@@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , we should use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG using images file format and are the original files in the JP@@ EG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ pics are added to the images of the images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed to you to view the status messages , in search of errors , but your e @-@ mail program is automatically rest@@ ar@@ ted at the end . with the button , you can unlock this window .
after starting the module of advanced Sli@@ deshow . you &apos;ll want to have a window with questions like your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all images on the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will be activated very elegant image out@@ puts through OpenGL . however , you need to possess a corresponding graphics controller , as otherwise the dip au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option will display that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images can be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the Loop makes sure that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , it is not used by the order of images in the album .
under delay between pictures can be the temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your machine and your chosen transition effect . you should then check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly chooses a different effect on each transition between the images .
while the slide allows you to access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stopping the Di@@ ash@@ au .
on the left side of the screen , you can see the current date name , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has not yet been documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets out the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE &apos;s surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the picture , are now available in each group , so in persons , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will find the categories for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF based information , see the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described for themselves .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can see with thumb@@ nails , to view the pictures of your interest .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; Star@@ ted album ; however , for each person you can store an own image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in this context , please note that you can display the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and simultaneously display a list of keywords ( if you do not possess appropriate images for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image is to be displayed for each individual person . now you will need to display the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image editor &apos;s entry . in the log @-@ window you can choose the enlar@@ ging factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be shown or cut .
if you access the entry in the main window , a dialogue will be displayed showing the dialog for fixing the image characteristics very similar . this dialog allows you to look at the picture again .
if you want to enter a string into the marking or description , the wir@@ es or descriptions of the images may be searched for . if you want , you can also enter a date , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the quick entry , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tions videos .
run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you start &amp; rip album ; for the first time , or select in the menu help the menu input script : -@@ demo . subsequently , some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; try out .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you data about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing only 10 @-@ minute view@@ points .
the tim@@ eline you can use on the following ways inter@@ actively : you can edit the displayed entries preview of the database ( if you select a date , the first image will show this date in preview images ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always the current date of the moment you showed in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . if you select an area , you &apos;ll preview only pictures of this time@@ frame . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; calibr@@ ated album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; integrated in the following part of the user guide , integrated in &amp; Star@@ ted album ; integrated version described above the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the over@@ looks and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . at col@@ t album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; col@@ t album ; export file will be created on the overview page . nutritional information on export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed without description . for example , all pictures are exported from a party . for example , all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific pictures from certain amount .
in this section you can specify how to look the HTML pages . most settings are clear why this is not made specifically .
down on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time . so , you can browse your pictures with lower resolution , which leads to a lower transmission period . if he &apos;d like to see a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting section , you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best to choose your HTML files for all your HTML files , and for any subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and set automatically at the next time . thus , you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if they &apos;re really all for viewer . if you have created for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created . the URL you can specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if you find the HTML files not included in the final target folder , you have to manually copy them manually . thus , the import function , see , correctly you need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are available .
the settings options described above have changed all three at the base folders and URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is set , whose name you set in the sub@@ folders .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to come together , you might want to use a HTML page to viewing the pictures . however , if you already have a lot of time for it , the pictures , people on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; cand@@ l@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even possible .
with &amp; Set album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the image properties are imported to you with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored with the file , or if the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of all pictures in the file can be saved and this file can be passed on independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Format ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the pictures in two ways . first , the images are not found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML @-@ export .
in the following , the dialog is described for the export of images you can export via the menu file ...
the main option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three choices are available :
when you make a manual close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the option Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; kis@@ sing album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it usually does not feel un@@ compressed . if you want this , just select the option of export file compressed .
the final option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that every image should be at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Format ... select it , &amp; col@@ t album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to import is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it can be that you own the category people of the imported file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is in charge of your database . that &apos;s why you are to be imported in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can edit the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it must be easy to browse images and watch : when you look at images , you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and watch a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book you will pass the different steps from ( 1 ) to pass the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the passing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adaptation options .
K@@ photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today your videos . in many places in this hand@@ book will talk about images , but frequently it also includes video with one .
&amp; calibr@@ ated album ; stores all of his information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal securing tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and uses this in future Star@@ ts automatically . if you once again want a different folder tree with pictures , you can run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : cold album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu item settings k@@ photo@@ sets ; set up ... come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the different settings options .
on the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can view the preview possibilities and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call for a button shift to the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
in case you describe how to set for each image different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol .
in the section sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up complete members of members , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all the groups of a member .
in view of the setting options available to you for the determination of the members groups , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ k@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this hand@@ book as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ sets ; however , most modules also have a help @-@ page that you can call on the modules themselves .
as the modules of multiple applications can be shared with each other , it can be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; therefore , you should always test new modules first by using the demo database before you access them via the command line with the command &gt; No input \ &gt; or over the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; kis@@ sing album ; not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; col@@ t album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are also using their images in albums : it is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; col@@ t album ; this type of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
thereby simul@@ ated &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture show at the moment .
besides the current album needs to be passed on a list of albums ; the modules also pass a list of albums . here &apos;s the photo album , as follows :
if &amp; rip album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , use the category people , it will be FREE . so , so if you have selected persons to view and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select the modules that modules are supposed to be loaded .
on the picture you will see an example of a star@@ tup screen once you start &amp; play album with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , you &apos;ll see the window , with which you can browse your image database . at the moment , you will not have much information about your pictures . in the section , we will return to this window , but then click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; quot ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture . you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is illustrated and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when you use the built @-@ in observer .
you can see three lists using a text box by choosing persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; mp@@ t album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to push the images within the list : if you have a family celebration and are illustrated in all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so you can find that the names used upwards moved , the people can find and assign .
if you prefer to have a alphabe@@ tically sort list , click on the icon for sorting after date below the list .
if you have selected any notes for each picture individually , you might want to edit all selected images and provided these pictures with notes . simply click on the button and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight these images and use the menu item multi@@ er entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ head group . to show you that it is an over@@ run group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ k@@ ungs@@ di@@ alo@@ is it can add an entry to an existing or new over@@ load or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also draw an entry into a category and disc@@ ard it to make this one sub@@ category of this item . attention , this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it .
you can shift the individual elements of the Com@@ pres@@ et , by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drawing it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adapted to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to get this window later again , use the button options ... and here then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
when you display the entry pictures in the browser you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or any images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply clicking the mouse using the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this is displayed in the picture frame . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with a picture frame , a new ad display will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture show . simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete and press either the Del@@ ete button , or select in the Edit menu selection . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; calibr@@ ated album ; for this problem you can have a solution . you can also use the photo album , without you saved on your hard disk . in the picture you will have to see the pictures somewhere , so if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , in which the upper upper left is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so you can preview images of these images . however , you can also preview these pictures with the image editor .
as you see , this function needs that you need files from the folders and to copy again . thus , if you want to avoid the introduction of the question in question , so if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger disk in order to store all pictures on it .
in the menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you filter the pictures that you want to make for other in@@ accessible and click on the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also check all pictures that may see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ xed and menu item All but current views .
with this , you have set out which images in the case of the case are to be hidden away . if you put the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , eliminating all the images you have blocked , click lock . if you want to get the pictures again , click Sper@@ ling .
it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered into the block of images . to set up this password , simply choose your password in privacy .
keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for example , all images on the disk and on the other can either read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only to those who are familiar with &amp; kis@@ sing album ; not very familiar with the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours of course that you want to see them sometime . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ sets ; for this reason you have an image video . you can preview it from the preview , as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , e.g. who is in the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag the mouse and disc@@ ard it elsewhere . you can also configure the information displayed on the viewer . all these options are available according to right click on the viewer . then you can see the right @-@ click menu .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a dip tank . how often it loads a new picture after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus or minus . started and hal@@ ted the di@@ ode by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer &apos;s viewer &apos;s viewer is to change in full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch in full @-@ screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer in the image and turned out zo@@ oming . you can easily pull a rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse . with the minus button you can check back r@@ er@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key you can reset your z@@ oom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity show the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos will work in and wi@@ red up with the plus and product key .
with the screen functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . at the moment you can watch the inter@@ rup@@ ting and configuration dialog of the image to view this name . however , you &apos;ll perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poorly , while watching one by one .
for both examples above , the observer gives you the chance to view images with characteristics while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can pres@@ cribe a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , if you have all pictures that you edit , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . afterwards , you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can display in the thumb@@ nail view . if you can display categories in D@@ re preview view , then you can press features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case , you are allowed to paint your photo album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the type you can re@@ vert your painted later .
in addition , you can see a picture on the painted age . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ sets ; insert in the image painting from the context menu . to finish the M@@ alen you simply hit the cross in tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the subject object of an already selected object , since all the items are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu input in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following folding menu ends , so that you can choose the correct position :
with delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the right @-@ click menu of right mouse button you can previously remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered properties , click on to apply these changes . have you entered invali@@ d values , a message is displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and then click on the changes with abor@@ ting .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the layout dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object using help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ k view .
press preview in Fe@@ atur@@ a view and a small sample of the scene is be@@ cu@@ ed with the chosen texture , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , you cross locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and spin . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visibility of visibility . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected visibility of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order , or if you need any other arrangement , you can set it as you can . you can also save multiple sh@@ utter orders and just switch between different arrangement .
to anchor a window overlooking or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the f@@ itter to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height .
if you wish to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the starter on a different view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map of the map in the views .
the last possible window order are float views : views that are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small to the left arrow in the tool@@ bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between dart and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them at any location .
you can save the current window view ... save it . a dialog appears when you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ amed the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ der Ren@@ der in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene view .
a Ren@@ der mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to ren@@ ders a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of Ren@@ der modes , from a quick preview up to full@@ screen quality .
if you click on the icon The Ren@@ der settings in the tool@@ bar or select from Ren@@ der modes ... select the following dialogue :
each race mode has a name . you can input any name , it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode .
in the body @-@ card size you can list the width and height of the image asset . if you want to ren@@ ders only a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section section and give the picture cut to ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ational field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model for a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user &apos;s manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is tra@@ ded with just a ray per pixel , there may be different errors . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or stool effect in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally speaking images of this property are better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is constantly re@@ group@@ ed and adap@@ tive because every pixel repeat@@ ed@@ ely spread again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sive loop depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if you adjust the difference between the pursuit of a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , at a lowering value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values , then the pixels is shared in 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be followed separately and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set up with lowering .
another option reduces the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of smoking for the beam process , called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , the rays are changing to a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ n@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which diff@@ use diff@@ use light @-@ re@@ flexi@@ on . it takes very long to make a scene with this property .
on this page map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if the related rays did not hit an object .
opens up a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if cancelled , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the menu entry file imports ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the full command @-@ run of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; cover this code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object har@@ ness into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . to import objects in the text file . to import objects in the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and insert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray @-@ command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene re@@ treats . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in equity view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set here the path to your documentation and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example in height of rocky ) into the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the paint for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the triangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type mark@@ ers .
you can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed ampli@@ fier for two directions separately .
if you cross the High detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are used further when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections using exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders .
when you cross a wall , a wall lies behind the objects . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ board pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
if you want to display ground , a soil below the object is cur@@ b below the objects . the floor is displayed in a ch@@ board pattern of two single @-@ adjustable colors .
if you activate can@@ o@@ smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information on parameters can be found in section Ren@@ der modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window frames are explained as you can create window orders and save .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard window arrangement : displays all existing window @-@ orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window @-@ orders shows all existing window @-@ orders . a new arrangement can create you with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and delete a selected arrangement with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be un@@ ambiguous and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . you can create new views with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and delete selected views with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ restricted windows you will receive a map view along with the previous view and web@@ ing anchored the view not in the main window but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow without the exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , taking beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for a first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set the camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
insert no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ ty , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following address :
take a little time to get to know the menus and existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item to delete . so you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ment of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please find more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instruction , but note that the camera in view points can change with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
if you apply the button , or press the button bar , change the wire @-@ views and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you could insert a qu@@ ader ( insert final body qu@@ aders ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a portable method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a simplified way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button , or insert the button bar . in the object , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends up to the horizon .
if you can view the object har@@ ness exactly , you will find that you can click the icon for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , spin and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just allow you to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the ground to adjust his material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little stream at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name displayed in the object tree . you can preview the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment only displays a mat@@ ted black material because you can still use settings for the pig@@ ment yet . now think the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities to do so , but take now the easiest .
if you don &apos;t have a color on qu@@ ader and ball in the thumb@@ nail , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now adjusted properly . if you want to ren@@ ame your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following results :
of course , this is not the color . you have to have more settings . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called mon@@ och@@ re . then select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already simply run this step as you should have understood the fundamental functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the properties tab , you can instantly change the settings . adjust the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the ball button or button ) , so the ball has float above ground . otherwise , the ball would float above ground , as you have shifted the floor to a unit down .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ te black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere of pig@@ ment . click the ball pig@@ ment , select then select and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on or push the input button .
the settings she@@ en effect and reflection arise already partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities offer you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ y@@ y@@ cing is a ren@@ ders method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the ren@@ derer is calculated as this ray through the objects reflects and broken , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects may impact as for example fog . thus , the scene is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be hin@@ dered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu item allows you to only select if you still have not saved modifications in the scene .
repeat the last one @-@ made command . this menu item allows you to only select if you have used editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to modify the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new command to this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the commands using this option tool@@ bar for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre @-@ smo@@ ked finishes without having to model any bu@@ mp on the surface individually and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etric shapes , which you can use as components : very complex 3D models are made from dozens , or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis , using a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show ; it is a convenient image editor and browsers . the application has a file browser which allows you to select images for display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; it &apos;s very easy . the file browser lists files you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button returns .
you can adjust if any image is displayed in a separate window , or if all pictures are supposed to use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just tap the first character of the file window in the browser window . then a small entrance field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable date is highlighted , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing returns or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog setting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show , there are five car@@ r cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short @-@ command for the display and short @-@ command for the browser , the short@@ cut @-@ abbrevi@@ ation can be set for the respective windows .
if this image is selected , then images are open in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad area is filled with the background color that you can proceed further down . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ ck@@ Show , this folder opens in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the image is filled with the selected color also .
you can make &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; to set up only some of the types of file types , which can also display the program .
with this option the display of display is extended to the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can type a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut @-@ abbrevi@@ ation for the different modes of &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the most part @-@ cards short @-@ command for the display and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window to .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short term .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short term .
displays curtains for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short term .

the image increases by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display display for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened more .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ came ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ came ; project .
&amp; show@@ piece ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ keys ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ piece ; if you are in the program as easy as possible mistakes or possible improvements . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ pictures ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , you may soon ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ foto . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , English spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ pictures ; to join it , it is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ pictures ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over its work@@ flows . there are many options that choose the behavior of the show@@ piece ; to set up the settings on display . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure of indi@@ an index should display the colors with what you are to be displayed , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ piece ; owns a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions for selected images . the same page bar can also be found in the picture editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than pictures to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for every picture a dialog to save or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the pictures before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be placed in the terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog opens to the selection of scanner .
the user can choose to use the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel or stop the scanner .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
in order to acc@@ ede to an image , the user can only launch a pre @-@ switch and then scan sc@@ anning for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by the preview button .
to select the picture better the user can look into the image and zo@@ oming in the current selection . it can also set the z@@ oom so that the full preview fits the window .
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in settings , then the image is shown in a sub@@ window , as shown below is displayed , then the image is saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
through the button settings , the equ@@ alled dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option before storing a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be selected .
this option allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can pick up . dialogue to save for each picture opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , you will automatically store it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you will need to be saved without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images stored in the option save without a file name . if the pictures are saved according to each scan , then this folder is used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically transferred images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to the saving image . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help start the KDE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the KDE About the dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under GPL licensed and the li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , using L@@ GPL . be@@ ware : li@@ bs@@ ane is under the GPL licensed with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used as all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of short@@ cut and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set short @-@ commands ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface by Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions which mostly can be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP @-@ functions from collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP @-@ function pause could look like :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the lines @-@ lines from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of any lack of addiction . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use c@@ dialog so the user ID , why a script does not exp@@ ire .
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ binding ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos;
in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can replace your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to every KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the export of external programs and commands . it is usually called the function ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; is called relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , they should monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to view the furnishings dialog . to save and loading the furnishings , each script should take care of each script . if a script will run , Amar@@ o@@ ok sets the work@@ station to the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length ) .
volum@@ etric Change new@@ Volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ le : sub@@ menu item , contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be clicked , so that the script can retrieve the cl@@ ums@@ y entry . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example recording data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script @-@ administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded the user &amp; eg ; downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ zip 2 ) , so that the user clearly can recognize the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the ground@@ ing amar@@ ine script . for this reason you should name your script packages right right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to receive file rights :
if your script is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ok ; script script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re also looking for a very specific title of thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; s collecting @-@ browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then , the playlist browser is exactly right for you . and if you decide the decision still hard , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music according to specific criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so you can listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !

Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the programs included in it ) because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to e.g. add modules or scripts ) . we have compiled a small guide , how to compile K@@ delicate minimal .
some functions such as the OS@@ D indicates that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are providing an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can check this file out by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang on the kap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and make the collection again .
most mostly it is that Tag@@ lib cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ b developers below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , used by libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to disman@@ tling the Met@@ a @-@ Information .
if you &apos;re using KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate car . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the attitude of the sound system , or use at least not worth 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . when it comes to a frequently asc@@ end crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed fixed .
this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 write into the met@@ a information , but this is not known as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ ar@@ g@@ v = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : m@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok &apos;s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) always see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . in some cases , you can click on a symbol de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : in@@ correctly icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ RO@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel , then check if Amar@@ o@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
in order to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or so adjust / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are most ligh@@ test by using an expert of your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use this forum and the IR@@ C under er@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake if there is something about a mistake in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start of the sub@@ window into the Statistics window was converted . you will find it under extras .
the importance of these symbols has changed to Amar@@ o@@ K 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist ; click the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the review for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select the playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let it fall , just as you would do it with other files , so easy it is : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , you can store the playlist playlist . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new . also look for li@@ b@@ ness , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar using E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , this really is true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is noisy which media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and p@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps , use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the pre @-@ setting no MP3 de@@ tain@@ ees can be provided ( from patent @-@ related reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input @-@ key
launch the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the g@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be combined together . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix -@@ Module for Al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) . take a look at the assistance of your mix for Al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problem and a solution . for g@@ stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ard ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media need to be de@@ coded first . G@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a de@@ mic or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . g@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . activate Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . activate Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
in KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa layout file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts driver , instead instead of G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the quicker Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .com such &amp; etc ; ) .
you probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer at the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less jobs react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the go@@ amer driver , falls &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ dy before ! ) : - Download your m@@ peg back , compile and install it . then execute the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
please tell you about bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions and wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is that already possible . place an alarm in your Calendar program and let you perform the alarm for this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the play@@ back ; make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have wo@@ ken up from the rolling hills of the music that you stopped before going to bed .
how can I check out the current title in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; running current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you performer and title of the running piece : ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ uses name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and user name with your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button marks a piece in the cliff @-@ looking into the queue . by pressing the input , for a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search returned .

click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database can not be created and on the console , a lot of error messages appear .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ o@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . you can switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and draw them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic codes you take files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ ing@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , the F@@ ROM statistics &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) ;
basically this makes previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has on the overall result .
you can insert the evaluation for a piece by yourself by clicking on a sp@@ readsheet in the playlist window . there , you can select the evaluation of a piece just as well , by clicking on the piece and editing : rating or F@@ 2 prints . you can edit the review also in dialog met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to release you when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means KDE packages have a fixed release plan that will not be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can also find quite annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol for playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool@@ bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design to install ....

if you want to use Al@@ sa then please get the newest version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of bu@@ zz and thus also a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine these output modules are not compiled . you have to configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably , use a distribution that is installed the development files from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files . you need to install the package g@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ins , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . afterwards , you must re @-@ compile and install again .
I get the mistake G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with p@@ relative , which is incompatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile g@@ stre@@ amer at no p@@ relative . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you are compile Amar@@ o@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... audio @-@ output specify the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ int@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 x@@ type plug lo@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ ence _ type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug lob@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } - l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual de@@ mix device , de@@ activate the h@@ ooks with sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio edition of Arts will not be looked after . you are not allowed to take this problem ourselves in your hand ! if you like , you can become the new so much needed advisor for Arts : )

group interpreter / album - First , the pieces will be sorted by interpreter and below it will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see coher@@ ent or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list below Di@@ verse interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - Albu@@ quer@@ ying name will be related .
group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are first sorted by genre and below by interpreter .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / album - This setting works just like the above , but in addition it is sorted even after album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing completely to expos@@ ing and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; will your collection automatically record when you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar you find a search filter . it acts in the list view as well as in the man@@ ure @-@ view . information about the use of this filter you can find in the section for the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , with whose help you can filter most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different time window , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . besides , you can of course also select your overall collection , making the filter virtually off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection @-@ browser you get the following possibilities .
download - This is the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play@@ back the play@@ back .
on playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
adjust the pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
as a playlist ... - stores the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
broadcast to media players - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / burn CD - Dad@@ ant are sent the selected pieces on K@@ 3@@ b and can be burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - aper@@ tures the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files in the du@@ st@@ bin ... - aper@@ tures a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under differences .
compilation mark@@ up - changing as a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be displayed under Di@@ verse interpre@@ ters but also under the associated interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser shapes the handling of many play@@ lists all easily . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists . the intelligent playlist consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even the intellig@@ ently play@@ lists are possible . click to add the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in / m@@ elt / i@@ pod ; if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the upper list of the media player .
to transfer songs to your iPod , drag the desired tracks out of the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter . thus , the pieces will be loaded onto your iPod . if the transfer is complete , stop &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the drives setup for your iPod .
the tool@@ bar is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in file lists all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can type music from a entered URL . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz and access input button , you can draw the music from there in the playlist . now you can draw the music from there to the playlist and drop .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ rais@@ al of files can be useful by simple case key . in the case the Fes@@ th@@ old of the Shift key will be helpful : this will be inserted dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the Mau@@ base .
the playlist maintains all of you to the play@@ able pieces . you can edit the sequence by typ@@ ing the mouse into the desired place . once you enter the letters , only the pieces contain . to reset the filter , push the button until the text box is empty again .
if you type separated by blank spaces , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for instance one two three , the search will find all entries the one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms , it will be searched for entries , which either contain one or the other searches . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , then include the search term with ge@@ opo@@ ds : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries , which contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you indicate a certain search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ th This is searching for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific phrase , create a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ tax@@ variants for expos@@ ing . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment room .
you can set the play@@ lists of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click with the right button of the mouse in the desired sequence of the entries . the entries then get a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are returned .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . you can add buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you find the button Add , with which you can add the playlist items . to the right , you can find playlist , playlist empty and random@@ ly mixing .
next the buttons are followed and re@@ producing . that allows you to und@@ o changes to the playlist or re@@ vert .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her @-@ rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos; configuration set up .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition and volume controls . you can set the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bar ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and play@@ time of the current piece . also , the status for random mode and re @-@ pick can simply change by clicking the mouse double in the appropriate ad area .
you can also hide the status bar . to enable you to view the status bar bar in general settings .
the context menu is accessible by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
one click on this entry opens the window of visu@@ alization plug@@ ins . there you can choose the visu@@ alizations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
behind this entry , a sub @-@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
the Cover administration is a useful tools for managing your cover images . you can start by selecting actions cover administration in the collection &apos;s browser .
the Cover administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left side .
by selecting the menu view , you can choose what to be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big withdrawal in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have a piece in the queue a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the pieces will play down : 1 will first play , 2 as a second , and so on .
the management of the queue open you through extra maintenance management . if you want to add a piece of queu@@ es , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can be changed in queue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists of which two are already given ( the details of the establishment of these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your whole collection and adds further random items during the play@@ back .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load @-@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist .
click on the playlist you want to drag them into the playlist window , or click with the right mouse button on you and then choose loading . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist therefore under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ featured modes of random mix and play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add the play@@ back to your collection . the recommended items will add at least one piece of your collection . the recommended items are added each time at the end of the first piece , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . over the same menu , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button New fill the current playlist and adds new pieces accordingly to the dynamic mode . playlist will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist you have the possibility to click Edit . subsequently , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
type here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this attitude is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will no longer be heard in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces are already played , taking into account the check@@ box .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to each play@@ lists . if you set up here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can choose from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the challenged playlist .
some scripts allow own settings . you can adjust the settings by running the script and then click on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scrip@@ ting , by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the &quot; Other scripts &quot; button .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . choose the script to install it then click D@@ ein@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please check the writing scripts according to scripts .
the dialog @-@ window Visu@@ alization plug@@ ins becomes an activation of available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply enable the cross @-@ in @-@ field next to the name .
this quick guide is to show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD in four steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore , and extended these functions even . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning of CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality burned down audio @-@ CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading the digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a fully open , patented , and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio Dec@@ or . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( eg . MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial endo@@ co@@ ders . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : an open open source code for los@@ sy @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio @-@ Encoder module so that you can read and write F@@ LA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ u decoder : further libraries for the processing of various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , WMA files to de@@ code them then to a audio CD burning .@@ de@@ co

trans@@ code : a command line program for video review . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful for adju@@ sting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and MP3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect which the tunes are different loud .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start the CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated menu contains a list of those projects . a click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the file has been over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s Dialogue Save under is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all the opened projects . this is the same as if you were to save for every single project file .
closes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . you can then switch between saving and change . besides , you can also break down and keep the project so open .
includes all the opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not saved project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were inv@@ oked for each project file .
includes all open @-@ opened projects and ended &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ stored project , it is asked what this should happen , as if the file has been inv@@ oked .
when you access this entry , you can select the image files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files are added in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . it is useful if you have files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function leads us to remove files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature removes no files from the medium , it ends only the previously imported files .
open the CD @-@ copying dialogue . this allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a CD which you can then burn then later . also , there is also the possibility of buying instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD @-@ copying dialogue . this allows you to create a DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can also only be able to burn a DVD containing a DVD using the copying dialogue . furthermore , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD using the copying dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW ; so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to form@@ at@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing mod@@ i and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previous DVD Video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used all@@ ine . it contains information about the footage of video , code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the included medium . this information is presented in the contents and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is hit , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD disk drives . if the contents are selected , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and lock@@ ings of the run or throwing the medium .
switches the contents view one or out . the content view enables the select and pulling files into the projection . the index is also the interface to read audi@@ o- or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the p@@ iste list in the proj@@ ector , or from . the copying list is a nar@@ ro@@ wer that is only visible when the projection list has no real function , it looks just hand@@ some and separates the proj@@ ector clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the button orders for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part has chosen , one can adapt the ke@@ ystro@@ phy for it further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . thus , the proper cre@@ denti@@ als for burning CDs and DVDs can be set . therefore , system managers will need to enter the password for system managers ( root ) at the start of the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general program@@ m@@ ations can be made . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended for person@@ alisation and fine @-@ adjustable operation of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; kis@@ ses ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface also , with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use the C@@ d@@ co@@ p functions , you can either use the Command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are vital in functionality , so it &apos;s more likely to convey to your taste and the type of your task .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the Command @-@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then give something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that all have to have in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Er@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void t@@ as@@ e@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) about void form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) about void form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) about void bur@@ n@@ d@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then you can get a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch in this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) void Tr@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) about void set@@ full ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b d@@ co@@ p cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ co@@ p / home / tru@@ ce / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files , depending on the en@@ coder , which is installed on the computer .
&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many co @-@ enco@@ ders that have to install these W@@ AV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . additional code can be added to the program ( if it has been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD are read ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( los@@ sy @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must be done now .
for the second step must l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ ed ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ans . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribution . however , only the enco@@ ding packages have to be installed . if for example , F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required .
which enco@@ ding / file format is to use ? the chapter of space Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction on co@@ aters , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; the DVD device can handle the protection , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once has to be made ( the setup dialog , however , can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration ) , on the hard drive . this leads ( hopefully ) to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will frequently be proud of at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on what enco@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the free@@ DB from the internet or can fully work without a network , where everything is detected manually .
this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step , you can find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry on CD @-@ data according to the establishment of a request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - when a Encoder is configured in the tab tab in the furnishing settings - the co@@ ding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that selecting with another Encoder as the default can be read . it is to note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the tab tool@@ setting in the furnishing dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the layout dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main introduc@@ tions dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various mapping cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you need to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ding and compres@@ sive rates and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of loss audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , the information through data compres@@ sing , lose according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG can have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio @-@ quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important because both codi@@ les produce very good audio @-@ quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; freely , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions available free of charge but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or one computer based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stere@@ otype . today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio @-@ quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and autoimmune systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely wish to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this attitude .
the &amp; CD ; information which manually entered or obtained from the free@@ DB program via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / needed to create &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the co @-@ service program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . the manual or the help of the code explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... set { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters used to be used ( = button @-@ drawing in ass@@ istants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs to upload the information instead of to enter into the computer . it is to note that here only is spoken by text : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the eber@@ ries : in this way , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that are publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither can the artist nor the music business are attached . all information may be obtained at a B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual , can be obtained .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively choose a cross@@ roads to choose ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( fake ) address given in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address will not be used in retri@@ eving the data ( This may only know the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for the use of free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally will be taken to use of free@@ DB . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mir@@ rors for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just the updates of the database .
which program @-@ program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that to use c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more accurately , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed if this is not yet happened .
to save the displayed W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ding and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at the first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the body . other code can be added at this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ er package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code . for more information about enco@@ ding are found in the chapter of the Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ation window ( eg . Con@@ sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the setup of device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , writing and read@@ ability , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio code of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all setup and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; use MP@@ 3@@ s with an V@@ BR ( variable Bit@@ rate ) on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
it must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , as it is not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have scre@@ aming on it ( eg by trying to copy it into the Kon@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section deals with the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each release &amp; CD ;
here we determine the drawing code for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting key quality ( MP3 ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) and which structure is used . since we are lazy , let &apos;s share the program with the free@@ DB to load the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be reading a &amp; CD at any time ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the read program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be specified , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries available there for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
the car@@ tei@@ es - General settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is shown as well / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only for full information ask , so that you will be informed when information concerning the evidence of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the car@@ tei@@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; to be connected to the Internet , so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk or fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they may be slightly modified with quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is to keep in mind : if you want to manually enter all the selection areas and free@@ DB is not used . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB large , think about this . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider these two selection fields to be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following car@@ p card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for the retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . set everything as it is illustrated in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the site fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load will be distributed among the machines . however , this setting will function as first attempt .
both function equivalent to what the server affects , because many fire@@ walls are bo@@ ck@@ eted by the protocol 80@@ 80 because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB servers . the first turning area should be de@@ activating .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is available on your computer )
number of simultaneously es@@ een pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author knows not so easy to try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : crossing this to the &amp; CD ; throwing at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this folder , then the path / folder can be specified in which the W@@ AV files are stored . if the field is not folded , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
everything is to enter as it is on the screen shot . the command is slightly long , under circumstances something needs to be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio @-@ quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio @-@ quality and storage power .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously co@@ ding W@@ AV files : in a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ de more than one W@@ AV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is structured on the hard drive , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will have to be picked up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any tap@@ ering &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of taking it out of the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window , moved up .
after a short moment , the pieces and length should be listed in the window , just like in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; could be read and could be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding settings .
note : if the &amp; CD ; successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled out and in addition , the artist &apos;s name and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window to give and you can select the database record , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ;
if you don &apos;t have selected the cross@@ roads for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger a local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet .
E @-@ 1.2 : the CD @-@ editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot , enter the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be typ@@ ed in the input field &apos; Cur@@ eller titles &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments or sequ@@ entially per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Edi@@ tors so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this option is set up on the code tab . let &apos;s take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ operations or file formats . see the code for the code to obtain more information .
simply select an entry , which is obviously related to the style of the out@@ put@@ ty CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the data entered into . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and procedure , in the same way until you have entered the title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked out will be read out . a simple click on the row switches the selection of the piece , or num@@ b the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection , then this window appears to confirm . OK , then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently being read on hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you when you are trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in for example . did you check if you have write write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is over . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . thus , read and code will take place parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found the configuration setting to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the result is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem during the simultaneous reading and co@@ ding ( but two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time ends in the upper left of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; C@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you know with CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already included a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; quot ; package is . install the package c@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to individuals who are compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how to adapt the program your needs if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . best you can read the step by step to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different car@@ tei@@ maps of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still read on ? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first time of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program @-@ start not audio CD ; in drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; who also wants to add something useful or change it . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange if we succeeded in bringing the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you don &apos;t need those information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke @-@ esp@@ iel@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he did not have real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ echo@@ ing texts , some features , the other &amp; UNIX .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; quot ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asonic project driver , which is required for us cards . Al@@ sa is included once it supports a sequence .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the op@@ pressing keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window will be drawn to K@@ Mid .
supports the two available standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically matches the procedure used .
seat support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; during the play@@ back of a song , K@@ Mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can Open ... from the menu file select . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also let a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and num@@ b the button &apos; button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu item or num@@ b the spaces .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with multiple pieces , it will be added to a collection and then re@@ played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and cycle with the regul@@ ator and forth .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the temp@@ o . to get back the original speed , double click on the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the blank spaces has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space button like a pressure on the button &apos; break or the lock@@ out of menu navigation in the menu piece , therefore inter@@ rup@@ ts the play@@ back while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text bags , others use lyrics , and some other both . some pieces do not have text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the E@@ gn@@ at type is automatically chosen to activate a song , so if you choose to adjust the automatic text message . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an ap@@ ign@@ ant type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or orders . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . in this section you will be able to use the collections effectively .
to put a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application this collection is not saved . concerns you when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button addition . it appears in turn , the file dialog , with which help you can select the song &apos;s desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the attitude of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is activated , a piece will be added to the opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection .
when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection will be activated and then added . this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs are played out . if you choose the array after the sub@@ menu of play@@ able menu of the menu , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the short@@ list of the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song further , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the key arrow to the right .
to jump around a song again , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the delete collection and click the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is definitely necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all the events of Type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and therefore always leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI map because all Sound@@ cards GM are compatible with ( including awe and CIS cards , FM units and so on ) .
sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file containing all the required compositions for playing a piece .
each section must appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
they see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI on your specific key@@ boards will be illustrated . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that GM patches are in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you are not allowed to change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All Key@@ board To M is needed to place all notes that supports this instrument to put the tone with the number M ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun plate . to add this to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun signal ) , it adop@@ ts Patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant to represent a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the ton@@ al of the always same drum ( like him have some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify such sounds on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you just need to use different names on the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form notes on the per@@ k@@ lock channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form a few channels to others . if you want to change the first and second channel , make it easy to change in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion to have a certain channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n the channel is shown on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map uses the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , which try to change the patch on this canal . in this case , will be used as patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the performer patch on the Per@@ k@@ PC channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ y@@ der@@ rati@@ o will be multip@@ lied in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ ding events will be multip@@ lied with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ comm@@ as are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ ben@@ ding event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , but try some key@@ boards to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave . to try to try the correct value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found under settings , point MIDI settings .
the canal view is a window with a whole string of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this cla@@ vi@@ atures you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the button is no longer green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to view the played notes . view in the menu settings under the point of the channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing what a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same marks in a very different way .
well , I cannot force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file requires 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ der distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without awe @-@ support compiled , you need to download and install the problem ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; home page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose all the files from , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
previously , activate the setting of automatic transmission to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD and to slow back the play@@ back . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double on the LCD double .
I have on a &amp; B ; work surface a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or inter@@ cept a file , only to the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you only want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the hiring of automatic transmission to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. do not only want to play the first file . so make the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid , and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , go to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect some time . as an hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , make music and prove propositions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ cus@@ .@@ es
you really want to send me a postcard from your home or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , but you should contact me if I might already have the file .
I have a k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get money by anyone else . I therefore want to stress that I can only further program , because / when I get feedback from users ( Post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the bug that the pitch was too high in awe @-@ cards .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the CIS support , has Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ ter , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a bug or even a supportive e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these outstanding musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ cho@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , since the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM unit or an awe @-@ card .
if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VI@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card except that you can of course listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ esh ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a bug directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is needed to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ y ; has not been finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the website The KDE website on new versions or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when there is information in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections with the menu book@@ marks , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of contracts , which are played by each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarch@@ plates . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ sets are copied to the current category and the play@@ back starts with the click entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direc@@ ting the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; do not run through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on the menu view and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed in this section .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu play@@ lists and select either the editing mode , or choose another category .
all changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during star@@ tup and ending can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c and changing from &#91; general Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation during star@@ tup needs to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would result in the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite image : &amp; lt ; his / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; and lt ; / &#93; ; im source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ back c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can play@@ back , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service providers for the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type I@@ x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishing dialog file allocation of KDE are specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to start in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library . the stu@@ ary process is called cr@@ p@@ player . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
as a result , a blue@@ end for a particular M@@ IM@@ E type is taken ( of course only when this was found ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c . for example phon@@ ebook will re@@ play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using a player or X@@ video ( this may need k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner must be used as the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
Con@@ figur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog in settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there should be selected ports that need to be selected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video , X@@ video should function also ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux which is only working ) . for this reason , the video@@ will need to function properly for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by KM@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of origin of this documentation these dv@@ d source , dv@@ d source , source source , t@@ v@@ anners , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ lists of the playlist .
is there any indication of how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the order HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is used as user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / CD@@ ROM shows the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why is every time my CPU has to be checked on their performance ?
note : the answer is superior . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ins will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surfaces and network support and is required for the compile of &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . using Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be applied to the package &amp; lyrics , respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be drawn up .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are listed on the ki@@ le ; website .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with l@@ atex ; , &amp; kis@@ sed ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users will probably have to read this hand@@ book . however , all proposals concerning the documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or the documentation is desired , the contact via the ki@@ cks should be established .
if you have any questions about or when compile it ; on or if extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ functions in a graphic interface and within that easy , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ programs . also called &amp; ki@@ le ; the possibility to complete , compile and troubles@@ hooting within the source text and conversion tools for this . finally called must be the easy to use assistant , the l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities to learn should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . very difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) and l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros use . a less challenging but realistic rendering is that it is from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
so here just a good chance to be l@@ atex ; given , it &apos;s not the ultimate book about it . to have a l@@ atex ; A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just like other identification languages also includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the general features such as paper format , side@@ numbered and text color begins with the command \ \ &apos; class , the kits begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; . the selection of ass@@ istants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document . you can also use some of the document related settings .
document classes : this is hereby given to the type of document &#91; article &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , book &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; C@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; C@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; pro@@ don@@ er &#93; or custom .
enco@@ ding : this character enco@@ ding is adjusted . modern systems should use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 co@@ ding as standard . in case , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of the l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most used supple@@ mentary packages for l@@ atex ; . for the involvement they can only be explored in the cross@@ roads .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ents of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users are now unable to worry about . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; it &apos;s just like other source code editors - the emergence of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; if you are not closed by the modest appearance of the output file , however , it will help you through the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save it through the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command , by entering a new command ( e. g. \ \ begin } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank page ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the closure of the command . this function can be disabled in the amount of settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and subtle element ) :
when you view the document in the struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective window .
in the creation of your own l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own or l@@ atex file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ness File ) &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator at the corresponding line in the l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and also other information such as the font styles ; or l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghts .
if you are looking for the elements of DV@@ I , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file containing the editor used and once upon a item in the DV@@ I ; file text is sc@@ anned . once upon a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was clicked , becomes the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; observer .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project preferences .
quick construction : the l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source code are available ) .
file increase : in this mode the DV@@ I ; file on the existing en@@ closure , on the site , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the quick@@ ening process .
in consideration of the editing tool@@ bar , the three steps were developed in the document . the selection fields were developed for the fast links of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... the available and l@@ atex ; commands given for the sub@@ division are :
the selection range more is the introduc@@ tory of articles such as tags , fox , fox , or spelling . the available options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or different element is created .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection via a selection range ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ e is used for defining the ty@@ ran@@ ce . there are the font to the main text , the joints , etc . , there are the following correspondence to cover :
in the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices for the purpose : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting up the settings . 2 . the document may be written from reason to hand .
the brack@@ ets after the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the font . if the ty@@ rants are not at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the above source code was typ@@ ed , the l@@ atex ; source code has to be compiled . the easiest way to do is to use the menu or button @-@ fast .
the code should be saved before the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage automatically out .
logs in the document errors , should be searched in the log @-@ way according to errors . if using rapid construction should be started . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the log @-@ regulation .
a environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document . for example , a report containing the font size : \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } , then the complexity of the ty@@ ran@@ ce into the area of Ries@@ ling . ( English ) .
the changes are only checked within the surroundings ( from \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) .
there are many possibilities for measuring the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fatty printing , cou@@ pl@@ ings , etc. are added . these commands either end with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin } : this command is for the course of the cou@@ rier and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be illustrated with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
once the background for writing the source text was shown with the l@@ atex ; Sel@@ ected language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once in the ass@@ istants a bit of text was entered , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to this end , mind@@ . a quote , a few places in fat and cou@@ rier and a poem to be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , using Editor view or Str@@ g E , can return to the editor ( in the internal observer ) . at an external observer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try out and have fun .
DV@@ I ; is a remote file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ness ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conversion or computer imaging .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I , then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar multip@@ lied the transformation of DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the transformation can begin to rec@@ alled other formats using the buttons in tool@@ bar .
how to search for the first jump from the editor to the previous position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; files must be set up only Modern under settings Ki@@ le ... tools building .
in order to be searched for the selection , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and should be clicked on request . the jump at the corresponding location in the DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator is then followed .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ . with one click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; open and used on the corresponding line . to this end , &amp; ki@@ le ; used as text editor ( settings ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ... editor )
if in the use of fast @-@ installation of &amp; DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator , there may be a mistake . should a mistake exist , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary .
the log file im@@ poses the error source in the source code . in the Editor , you can view the errors in which the error appears . in order to consider the faul@@ ty line , the error must be clicked on the error in the log and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar is clicked , a window appears to select the template for the document . the features presented are :
when selecting le@@ eres document , a document may be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
cav@@ ity users of &amp; l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates , in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file must be created or created a new file . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting from a document template . create a new template .
when creating a new document from a template using the file , some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or drawing co@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in settings ck@@ les ... settings gener@@ ously .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by entering documentation : \ \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the ass@@ istants and the associated entry for the commands in the editor . once the document created in this way was accomplished :
when creating a new document then your own template is rather than the standard of standards .
a template can be created from any number of l@@ atex ; files will be created in a simple way to create a template , should be sought after one in the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the availability of reading and her@@ edi@@ ty of many different types of text ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be made in the menu , directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to find out more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities should get to know the manual for Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be inv@@ oked by the Help La@@ Te@@ X Re@@ ference . you can find an optional description nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button to convey the &amp; tex ; which means that in this way by clicking on \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; , only \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in front of the text with printed linear mouse button , the text automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons with penetr@@ ated Shift , parts of the source text can be washed in the editing window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source texts and to highlight these ones . for example , the l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many ass@@ istants you can add some of book@@ marks within the text . the menu acc@@ entu@@ ated the jump to the next or the last jump @-@ stamp . also this jump @-@ mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically associated with the first input of a character .
the mach@@ ining is probably one of the main aspects to use a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Kate ; many attractive features were added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special orders for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text selection :
if a complete paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank lines ) . this extended meaning slept with that tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; thus , the only prev@@ ent@@ ative thing is separated by two blank lines .
w@@ ns the word under the current cur@@ sor@@ position . this choice also has an extended meaning , since this command also l@@ atex disposable ; commands with a section ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to L@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ ing a part of the document can be removed naturally and by wir@@ ing the button is removed . &amp; Kate ; provides with its own commands given to a faster result . under editing , the following commands are included in the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of editing paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF further prec@@ ep@@ ts under editing environment for an easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
this command extends to the beginning of the current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the place of the surroundings .
this command will j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the rest of the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ drive { environment } , it is j@@ umped to the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many squ@@ ander@@ ed Environ@@ ment@@ ing commands can be quick to get lost . in this command , the most recently created environment , so that the nar@@ co@@ ed ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X @-@ Group are a few important commands that correspond to the editing environment .
this command will j@@ umped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the s@@ wollen cl@@ amp .
with this command will be j@@ umped to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the v@@ aults .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the wei@@ ghted cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many squ@@ ander@@ ed groups br@@ aces can quickly reach the comple@@ tes ahead . in this command , the last used group , so that the termin@@ ated structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be destroyed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple instructions are used as a license for purpose . for the end , the sign is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; do this case and for two fall , the sign for &amp; l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double sofa characters can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and be exhausted .
you can also use any specific settings ( e.g. , german or French ) and thus German or French may be used . there are also many more languages available .
for example , for Shift ; input @-@ button , a smart pointer type . if the current position is located within a lists area ( such as enumer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a new@@ line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjoining sign @-@ off .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be ki@@ cked up under settings ; establish the La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the fis@@ sur@@ es in tables and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; try to inv@@ ent it . while this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the same thing , for it &amp; ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the fis@@ sur@@ position of the current table .
although &amp; Kate ; already a good source code has been installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to get special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still extended . these are three according to demand and the other two are available for automatic re@@ organization . all of these modes can set up different working conditions under settings ki@@ le ...
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { surrounding } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the rest is the last letter of the input , the last letter is removed , so that the list of lists will be reduced . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , descriptions can be dropped by &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping marks , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of the spring@@ board N@@ Ã ¶ ste jump is possible and the added parameters can then be introduced .
under settings ki@@ le ; establish ... ki@@ le ; Ver@@ sions can be made to these lists . there are different types lists for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; commands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ent of the general language used can be used .
the command mode is in@@ appropriate for the termination of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to follow . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments .
in the call of completion mode or the keyboard mode , the command will automatically logs in the area and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient is continued on the easiest way and by the input , the input will be completed .
once this has been accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under settings ki@@ le ; establish ... ki@@ le ; use settings to these lists . this mode uses the complete list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported by custom lists of det@@ achments which are immediately replaced by L@@ Ã ¼ lower strings . as an example of a subscription list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word processing mode has been replaced by the character of str@@ e + Alt whit@@ eboard , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
jobs are not helpful for automatic amal@@ gam@@ ation . however , it was found that many W@@ aters have been written in a document more than once . this provides &amp; ki@@ le ; the execution is already written .
this mode can set up in the menu ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ complete . here , the Corpor@@ a value for the ad can be determined .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / dres@@ ser / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for designing ( subscription ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ r@@ r@@ r@@ er@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed the inser@@ tion of graphics as easy as possible . to the background view of the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and observed .
PS -@@ files are not as well known as PDF files , but can provide an excellent basis for the en@@ roll@@ ment and re @-@ orders of pages . will the download pages be modified with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be modified and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to be able to watch the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all components tools are group@@ ed in the menus to create comp@@ iling , creating and create a view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source text , such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further transformation can be used to be ke@@ ystro@@ ke Alt ; 3 by means of old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file into a PS file and by means of old ; 5 the PS file is viewed .
when using the command fast , it is usually called a spect@@ ator after comp@@ iling . should not be used as a one @-@ based spect@@ ator , each time a new window will appear .
a new project will introduce the project New Project .... here the following information is asked for the project :
while performing the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the script to be managed by EC@@ MA@@ Script @-@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the ver@@ tically under@@ list .
the API scripts have not been developed yet and can be used in further versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first must be said that the switch environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
l@@ atex ; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; lyrics live ; are delivered with many documents . in this includes documentation for the contained packages and a further l@@ atex ; reference .
a complete refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and then , on the site , is described , but rather a full @-@ way manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and is ideal for those looking for a specific form@@ at@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
based on the amount of documents with which &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the use of the correct document is not always easy . alternatively , the small application tex@@ do@@ t@@ k offers that a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; transferred documents and given a graphic super@@ structure .
all documents are divided into categories and the most significant advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the subject of the blank spaces for the viewer .

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous and HTML ; files are deleted every time , if supposed pro@@ c started .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentary has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply leave the current work@@ station . if not , then select the current work@@ station and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to a output on the screen the file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported mistakes and try again .

type the name of the file , as the result is named , the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly have little to do . this allows the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately profit from the additional functionality and don &apos;t have to wait until someone can be used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we begin plug @-@ in with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins can be used without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to find the plug @-@ in .
often in one project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team manager as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose to look out of the list of members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and the button set as pressing . currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and hiring their own identity are important to news and notes . see for further information on comments .
apart from an overview of their team there is another advantage by the collection of members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team managers if something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project is done . an example would be seen how much anyone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script called a file to the CV@@ S once they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project preferences , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list of selected address data . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
add comments is simple . it can either select the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ click menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by the text box .
notes can be sent to a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case , the syntax name @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , taking part in the project from the following possibilities : team leader sub@@ project leaders After the departments - and sub@@ project leaders should be stated as in the following examples below .
nickname and roles names are independent of large - or mini@@ ature , but spaces for brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ at@@ ting languages , which D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic is and web@@ based form@@ at@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here are just over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings will be treated , a short description for the other can be found .
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... called this dialogue extends over a number of pages that are dealt with .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car communication can thus be changed . the entries are :
large / mini@@ ature of tags : large / small case @-@ case of automatically en@@ quired tags . normal Groß / l@@ essor means the tags are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small ins@@ cription of attributes : large / small ins@@ cription of automatically inserted attributes , the attributes are inserted as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically shut : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the subsequent day is op@@ tionally available , this immediately after &amp; nbsp ;
not optional tags automatically close : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
starting and conclusion @-@ day automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during installation .
M@@ IM@@ E types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default standard , the default values can be restored .
standard string enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of newly created or otherwise displayed as a file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) . however , this attitude here will be transmitted from the same in the proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . but this attitude here will be extended from the same in the property characteristics if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regular backup copies , so that in a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even if not stored documents is regularly created , according to the given time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in a separate view ( or documentation in a part @-@ party ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
setup the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface has come through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ range area serves the tax of the possibility to switch the ad of warnings issued by squ@@ abs of non more queries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchron@@ ization behaviour of V@@ PL@@ O and the source code view in the distributed mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structural tree brings the following action it is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ turing .
in the structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in changing the structural tree will be set automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty fields in the text , while blank groups are such , where no element in the current document was found .
the area for fixing abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that are un@@ folded in editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are classified in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s be valid . this means it can be a valid batch for PHP , where the i@@ f@@ oul em@@ ir@@ ation can be something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting an plug@@ ins must be given the following :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in , if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode download : check if the plugin is denied the loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts , usually refuse the store , when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : is this activated , then tests &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the specified information is correct . then , the saving of the plug @-@ in also allows , if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gging is completely new developed . Die@@ support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was adjusted , as well as the support for the db@@ g Debug@@ ger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations over plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adds .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a proper debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the button options next to the Debug@@ ger plug @-@ in selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content is displayed by CC@@ TV variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ os . this action is triggered by default if a project is used , that it normally does not need to be respected .
the counter@@ part of debu@@ gging session starts the session . concludes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the leaves to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to direct a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debug@@ ger edition .
shows the debu@@ gger where to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently executed line continuously . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution is continued before a debit request started , the script starts with the requirement .
indicates the debu@@ gger where to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution runs ahead . happens before a debit claim begins , the execution starts once a requirement is provided .
the debu@@ gger guides the next instruction in the script without responding to the functions or includes .
the debu@@ gger introduces the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes in error .
shows the debu@@ gger to move the instruction and go to the next one as if there were the current one .
opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the re@@ movable value appears in the variation @-@ view .
with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document@@ aries Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and the CSS . tag folders contain two types of file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . Tool@@ box are handmade , symbolic @-@ oriented bars of images ( above the Edi@@ t @-@ window ) , insert the text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see details for conversion .
this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ making . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ r@@ alo@@ ges , which shows &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool making a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is set out in a simple way .
this is the root element of an equ@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type on itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the Tag@@ ty@@ p class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 )
only for the type meth@@ od@@ ine valid . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an anti @-@ attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; quot ; text &gt; Day . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen for any attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are additional tags , describing how this attribute is to be indicated , &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
indicates the bot@@ tling used source codes for the attributes in tag editing dialog , and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology . the arguments to be handed over to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ ging % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ tag comp@@ lies with the elements of a list . it can only happen for an attribute description only once . it is an only element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags in a dialogue . this day can happen for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the item is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialogue once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; quot ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is an only element type .
prints a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration shall begin : &amp; nbsp ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be properly clicked and closed .
spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; &amp; quot ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the tag@@ XML files , the tools can start up in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the review will only take place at the store of the tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following one example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example of a functioning family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of these tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Terms = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for one out of a list &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following contracts :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simpl@@ istic name of D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
this action entitled to wei@@ ghted keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the user interface , the button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation can be assigned a button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation ; with a button the current button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation is removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when running the action , this text is inserted in the document to the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick@@ est start @-@ dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter will be given . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting files in the command line : global script folders : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There is other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file will be removed : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process is replaced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is set up unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods can take a script input of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the standard input . in the selection field input can be determined what is to be sent to standard input . options are :
selected text : the document selected will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually recommended only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the extended application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , to the standard version . it can be stated , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the value the selection list :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in the given case , there are not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure your actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
complete all the fields required and add them to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes have attributes and you plan their use , activate a dialog &quot; day , &quot; when available , so that an entry in the action of the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I have decided to create a starter button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually noted , rigi@@ dly , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ led ; -@@ Day in the current document will insert .
after the creation of the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with setting actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the apply button and continue using other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some conventional &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar or it should set them to better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar setting via settings tool . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to add to tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool@@ bar .
please note , how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored im@@ root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ at@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter explains how I create a &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might consider in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Re@@ pository See if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you must look for an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ que / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . first , we will leave you , the second we treat it here .

the section tree is defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see it in the &amp; PHP documentation :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top item = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 documentation = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = Sett@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ onom@@ .@@ html ...
note the # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess lessons ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ ure &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; quot ; in all &amp; XML ; - based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources c@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the contents section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed on the layout of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; Skri@@ script displays the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by flag@@ ging of the function and pressing by C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the socket lines .
a simple list of covers separated context @-@ elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these are well and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as documentation used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not become rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , are you not alone . it is possible to share the associated resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send by email to friends , partners or else who are sent to . at various places there is an email to send menu application , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates , and in scripts tree .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users will be able to download them . the contributions are checked and only available for publication . in order to sign a user account , what there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you may need to search out . in the dialogue New resource requires the input fields . ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading begins .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and in the context menu files and folders in the templates and scripts tree can be started .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signature . in case of problems there may be broken . if the integrity are given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet produced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but it can be time @-@ consuming , as hundreds of tag files can be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D load and Conver@@ ting of D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue will appear :
target section : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .

tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after the transformation the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and do the full benefit of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first get acquainted with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to give them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also available . by tool@@ ing on actions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this allows the group of administrators to secure tool@@ ing , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that it can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool making use of special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , making the common usage of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the editing window , the builder , the car@@ tei@@ es with info and the tool@@ bar . please hit in , and for further information on these sectors .
you can click the Car@@ pa@@ thians with the right mouse button to remove a context menu with the current documentation et pass@@ able orders , such as close the current , other or all car@@ nation , re@@ charge , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editing field , leading to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic usage steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , processing of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , using the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or Open the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tors , the Edi@@ tors are currently participating , and HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default to which a set of tool@@ bar will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ ing is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which represents the day . now , you can insert the data for that just added tag . if you want to insert the data for this straight tag . if you want to insert it a day that has several attributes , you can fill in a dialogue different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and wander . in the presentation with car@@ tei@@ es stand for files , project , pattern , documentation , scripts , attributes , and documentation components .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows the ste@@ ward of files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as add , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from memory medium can be performed using the click menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the respective users and assists in projects are available only in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script . on the right mouse button you can start further functions , such as the script to edit or send an email .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking of the element it will set the cur@@ sor in the document to the position of the element . through the right @-@ clicking of an element it opens up a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other sub @-@ views . with it can change man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this refers to the content of the disposable income system , allows modification of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ pack@@ aged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project it can proj@@ ec@@ ated , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two Kar@@ tei@@ es at the bottom of the window , can be reached through the usable information : the news window and the problem window .
this car@@ illon shows information about each in the Qu@@ anta running script . so , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this car@@ dium marks all the faults in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ ing are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ ate e@@ ite of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own orders as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with enam@@ el . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail , they can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf file a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to provide a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help one . the options are simple to understand and not executed .
if you have problems at the start of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 am folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; equ@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for a rapid Web @-@ development and combines a mat@@ ured development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , began to employ the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exten@@ dable mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim needs to be arrested , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Sc@@ st is not only all of it possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase the automation of almost every task . through the program of coma , they can now expand &amp; equ@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detail documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta perform ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ectively sequ@@ ite @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file , which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project executive , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the HTML ; check @-@ up , so that they appear correctly and are not understood by the browser as form@@ at@@ ting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; check @-@ up , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a row number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; - script error messages !
search a string or regul@@ ary expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window to or not . that &apos;s the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debu@@ gger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initial and turning of the problem porters at the bottom of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the struc@@ tur@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the tool@@ sp@@ old left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
introduces a dialog to paste files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searched for the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows e.g. graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
download the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; depending on whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
attitudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
invites a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in the project / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have allocated it to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set up by settings actions ... to be added . Tool@@ box are stored about tool@@ bar tool@@ bar or you will be asked when you want to save the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this del@@ etes them from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , that the tool@@ bar in the next release is available ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
loading a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; , you or anyone else made others and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities out of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; . is sensible , if the entities out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew . if this global is and a write permission in the global KDE folder does not exist , it fails to load .
this menu includes a list of tags available in the currently available tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags and actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific subjects .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; deny the inser@@ tion by tool@@ bar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . click a activated plug @-@ ins disabled .
select the syn@@ tax@@ onom@@ ic mode for the current file . the list of available exercises schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
select the type of pointer identification . very useful if you know people using the other OS platforms for development . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; with external application .
immediate conversion between different ways of user interface . through some limitations in the KDE libraries , the Shift mode can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the car@@ r card mode , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu features an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of one entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect every application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
direc@@ ts the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to below , since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , to which you want to access , except your local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ unparalleled .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . when a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . when a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows files to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static we@@ bin@@ ations you want to download and change . in server @-@ based script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
skip , if files , which are somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be included . if a project is started anew , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
with this option , all files and folders are shown within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of fertili@@ zers .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking , or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that will simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the men@@ ace window , or using the short@@ cut Shift . F@@ 7 are changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which can be re@@ formed in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to top , also files which are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project overview , which is loaded when opening the project . in addition , more than proj@@ ections can be read .
this enables the desired debu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be adjusted with the button options . in , the debu@@ gger is described .
upload profiles can upload high @-@ profile profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a blue@@ print for the content of the server for each profile , showing a separate builder for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as delete a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , one can turn on event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions will be executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the si@@ pping of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at this time .
to open a different project , choose project open ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave likewise , but the entries are open and opening with ... in the right button of the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ surge files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is available , the button will exp@@ ire to prevent removal .
the password will retain in the core memory and forget at Program@@ mer . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is needed and the more uns@@ afe password to save on the disk does not get into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) will be up@@ loaded onto different servers . when editing or creating a profile will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slave . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the plate so that it can not be easily read , but everyone can easily see in plain text text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ ing . it can be used in a project many views , that is , through simple exchange of view , multiple files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replaced the currently opened files and tool@@ bar .
views can be opened in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to use the menu tool@@ bar . use and Add @-@ adding will differ below in the section of adding tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and icons can be set either using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New action , a New tool@@ bar can be set , which results in the dialog , where can be specified , which actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible .
by calling the context @-@ text to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition to remove the entries , remove the action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and actions on them can set up their settings in the menu with settings tool ... and setting up actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ p and files for link@@ ages . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses basically like a nasty fil@@ esystem with exten@@ sible organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any system existing directory in the pl@@ orable tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in some of the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template &apos;s conditions before using .
binary is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be added any file except text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries . binary templates are usually available in documents by short@@ cuts ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . further information about the templates , is available in documents .
documents can be created by any text type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the process @-@ making tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final note up to a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are included in the process @-@ making tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , in a zi@@ pped tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure to Beli@@ ever ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file As a template save as a local template ....
once that has been done , you notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project pad ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the process @-@ making tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template store selection as a local / student template . alternatively , the selection can be removed with pulling and dra@@ ins on the man@@ oeu@@ vre templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a sub@@ folder folder . all file management functions are used , such as pulling and Able@@ gen or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click in the file tree or in the project file sub @-@ view onto a folder to the right and backup it . by default , the project folder is assured , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented procedure . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files presented in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / apps / templates /
to set the behavior of a folder in the template with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select the right @-@ click menu . the following dialogue will be displayed :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as El@@ ter@@ al attributes have been damaged .
this is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the regul@@ ators in the preliminary view . if a root folder would be adjusted in principle , unless they would appear explicitly . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , you probably find themselves in a regular folder .
allowed or set @-@ up text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of ingredients to equi@@ p a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) via a complete command@@ ing collection for adding folders or copy , and insert them from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; the Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the source text editor with the V@@ PL ; editor and the second mode is sharing the Edi@@ tor@@ window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he invites a document like a regular &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; then you can edit and switch back to the source editor , in which the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor to a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit or edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes are enabled both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will sync this mode , then mode of pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the Synchron@@ ization Editor between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor allows you to select between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . when selecting automatic can be adjusted in addition to the time period . basically , the recommendation applies : a small span@@ iel for fast computer and a large range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , then you want to select the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be created . that &apos;s the reduction of the suspension code . that &apos;s how you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document yourself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows modification of content , e.g. keywords in column name and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the contents -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules using the buttons below the list or delete . a change over the list is possible just as with the Met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template , pressing to the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ sors is possible , as in a text processing , due to the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor is as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be introduced by typ@@ ing or removal @-@ button .
inser@@ ting tags is made in the same way over the tool@@ ing Editor , as in the source text editor , not removed . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags at previously already existing identical tags , e.g. if an anchor tag , is inserted by text , every other the surrounding anchor has to be removed .
some tool@@ ing like the tables Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . they are later called in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of style templates . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ ling , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compiled , do need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can browse with the arrow buttons on / off by the use of the previously made commands .
multiple commands may require more than one argument . quotes may be used to set up compound words as an argument . &amp; eg . : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holder in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are lots of graphical tools for comparisons . why &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribution had been made and corrected at many places the reg@@ res@@ sion had been corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts associated with .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the re@@ arrangement had changed . this change was a small nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparative window .
a function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ file browser .
also 3 @-@ way connections will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons are working independently of each other at a piece of co@@ de and make changes . the co @-@ guide editor allows you to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected . in this Editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files to assemble
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you also with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of current color monitors . if you have to check code frequently , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are shown visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle more , if someone changes the reverse . )
when a file is identical , and the other differs in a row , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself the ti@@ pping work easier by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example :
folding 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 CH@@ ner@@ 3 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folder
open dialog allows fil@@ en@@ type file name , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting an recently opened file from the list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences will be carried out with two files .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders is introduced , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A to the two other folders .
if together , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set the output file immediately . you can do this step later on saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the same file .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active TV window . the comparison starts then immediately . in open dialog , you will need to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pulling and dra@@ ins : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a compar@@ ator window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you have to load only two relevant files , it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; upload and then compare . now you can copy the relevant sections easily , insert and then compare .
note : right now you can pull nothing out &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; pull out . only the case of text in a similar window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and dra@@ ins of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such cases , your original data might be lost .
in the upper part of each word window is the info line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file is different . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
left beside the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , there are white characters only in strings and comments , relevant to the processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the contrac@@ tion column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the pointer is checked , the line is dot@@ ted along the broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ es windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the ins@@ cription output : the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ band@@ ed , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons R@@ inge to a higher resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the colour background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes the automatic merge or by manual leaves no further line left in the group ; then there is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind , and perhaps again select another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark@@ er you may perhaps copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; con@@ tainment conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go cau@@ ti@@ ously with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as well as white characters .
navig@@ ating mainly with the screen runs and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , beginning , end , string , beginning and stran@@ ds , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the crossing column besides the vertical box can also be used to use the N@@ avi@@ an .
in aug@@ mentation window you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and transfer mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the squee@@ zing columns syn@@ ced the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as stated in the section and the edi@@ table window have been declared ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ bottom / trunk up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture A@@ way ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the markings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this option is , whatever you mark , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying . be careful with this option but be careful because you could dis@@ miss the content of the cli@@ p@@ board accidentally .
po@@ ets are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use auto @-@ run \ \ r \ . K@@ HAN@@ 3 keeps the drawing of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use bin@@ aries files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( Menu In@@ stell@@ er@@ - &gt; K@@ ail@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog presents also writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in recur@@ sive script . if the chosen writing is not supported , it does not happen at all .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be ast@@ ert . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd color .
when this option is activated , when pressing the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise a t@@ abl@@ ator is inserted .
if you press entry or return , the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection automatically copies into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then falls off .
you can select which pointer type you prefer to save . the set value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the same time , try C@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . in this step white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon sign &apos; \ &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car turns out , but then you may be treated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , however , like a white character . during which collapse this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , figures and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are dealt with as changes in white characters .
intense still look for smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and big files , but slowly at very large files .
in the Autom@@ atic @-@ rout@@ ing mode determines this attitude , as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is inj@@ ected .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters in white characters . ( default choice . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters in many files are less important . please note that the automatic selection also deals in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter for sc@@ anning from folders and diar@@ rhe@@ a . check for details on documentation for the directory @-@ comparison and direction .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a back@@ pack file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting to the interface of the user interface . changing this option affects not the currently running program . you need to finish and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you have enabled this option , for all entries the upper adjustment is used .
over the selection fields for co@@ ding appears a brief indication of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ tations . since the co@@ ding is individually adjusted for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have processed an file , you can specify which co@@ ding should be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they could possibly not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can handle only with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can determine the code from the output editing command .
switch this off to sup@@ press announcements of changes in white characters into the text or survi@@ vor . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in the normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , you might want to check only the differences between two of three files . according to selection from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; C , A &amp; B ; C , C or B &amp; lt ; C , C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second crossing column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending up the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
configure the other window next to each other or another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click will automatically start the assemb@@ ling and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a pre @-@ set name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart it , the name of the last used file will be used . )
when reading a file it will pass on to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function for example , to cut disrup@@ tive parts or correct the re@@ use .
when reading a file it is passed first to this external command , then the output of the command is given to the input command . the output of the command is only used in the line command processor . you can write your own processor command , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the slide results . but for this , an external application requires , and most users do not want to program yourself . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l totally inadequate .
use this pre @-@ processing command to convert into Up@@ letters &apos; s / \ \ U \ \ &apos; / \ \ U \ \ &apos; . * \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . \ \ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first Kl@@ am@@ mer@@ n@@ few . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word _ Auth@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Auth@@ or \ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _ _ \ _ BA@@ R _ _ _ _ _
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . sed it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ line matches . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; is a hit , and every hits is replaced by nothing , so practically er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several options at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed sed you can also use something else like e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; allergy . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the moving &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ proc@@ essor are maintained for viewing and to merge . further operations only change the data that the pointer is identical to al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders and merge .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... it can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated changes , and displays the simul@@ ated changes without it really perform ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is the same and merge of single files very similar . you just need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , Fol@@ ner@@ 1 is used as basis . if no target folder has been specified , U@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ in@@ 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison from folders automatically starts , do not start it up . to run it , you must select the corresponding menu button , or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
during the entry of the folder you will find a little news window on the current progress . if you break the sc@@ anning of the folder , only the files are listed until then .
if the sc@@ anning of the folder is completed , &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder that was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can double @-@ click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object or use the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories , and list all sub@@ directories with which you can capture all folders and / or folders .
if you want to double click on a file , the file will be started and it will be a comparative window .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the co@@ vert action cannot be automatically elected . if that will bring together , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as seen in the image above , columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow and black .
however , in identical contracts , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same disk type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same disk type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ ization is active , if only two folder and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option is sync , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but do not exist : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after that , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and selecting the new file ( unsure ) option , then analyzed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 . if the files are different , but the same date then appears . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange does not eliminate such errors , this folder can not be started .
while connecting a file after another one . you status column shows Fer@@ tig , when it collap@@ sed , and according to other reports , if something unexpected has been completed , you should make a final review and see if the status is all right everywhere .
when the file dialog box is selected full @-@ term analysis , K@@ decker 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can merge with either the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all co@@ vert actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge it together .
please note : if you have no target folder , then in three @-@ folder mode C , C as the goal is used to merge with two @-@ folder files , B as target and used for synchron@@ ization A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped through the particular entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to bring all entries together : select directory form / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to run only the current item , select the action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if by contradic@@ tory data types still invali@@ d actions exist , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options running , simul@@ ate and ab@@ ort .
select Sim@@ ulation if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then guides certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window opens up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select once again or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , an appropriate dialogue will appear . then &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 continues its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; clicking on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will find some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with it .
if some entries have been individually assembled , you notice &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them at the later stage of all entries . even if this has collap@@ sed later or not saved , these entries will change as settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged once again .
the settings @-@ menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ ail@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merger with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element row . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg * * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folders do not have to comply with this pattern .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element row ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element row ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ op@@ tionally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have a default file . in other fil@@ esystem a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in the default configuration .
when links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link@@ ups are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively searches . a link to a folder that contains a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is switched off in the default setting .
introduces a complete analysis of each file by demonstrating the statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare big folder via a slow network , it &apos;s possibly faster , just the chan@@ ges@@ ic date and the file size to compare . however , this speed is cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is in the default setting .
similar to confidentiality of the chan@@ cell@@ or . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . for example , it can be useful for example when copying the amendment date . please use caution . this option is in the default setting .
enabled the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder . in this mode , the suggestions for merge files will be identical . also , the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is regarded as uncertain as it is provided that the other file has not been changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in the default setting .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g enhancement already exists , this will also affect the normal composite files , not only the composite folder . this option is enabled in the default setting .
normally , the ste@@ wards view stays visible to the single files visible ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window directory &amp; text window to switch to the window in the window menu and switching between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu item . you can merge the function Cur@@ rent file from the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be merged once you merge the folder .
this status will be lost however once you read the directory again : directory menu : new read
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ HAN@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can open files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path can be relative . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ ashed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty sheet &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays . then , always a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , SF@@ TP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit cre@@ denti@@ als or modification of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option confidential for the size . ) ( This is only possible on local files ) .
the main purpose is currently used as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences . to boot K@@ ail@@ 3 , press the right mouse button of the differences in the viewer and then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part , the input file is a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - K@@ ail@@ 3@@ Part . additionally , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; run as part , it only supports the equivalent of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that will merge or the equivalent of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ De@@ 2 ( now He@@ is it comp@@ are ) there are already . besides , the name K@@ ail@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the slide @-@ tool collection .
I use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go for it .
you probably have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be notified to the correct pre@@ fix . in the default , configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs vary , these lines will be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is treated differently , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines are coming to each other , this is , but this is the case of the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information goes without clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is simply being saved as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a file format that could store this information .
the effort of this was so far too big . you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; published and the text does not delete it . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to make out of difference . even more reduction would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . use this for an other editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
you can find information on how to use K@@ ag 3 on other platforms without KDE .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ v@@ 3 ; compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system in which KDE installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems at comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Del@@ ete ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or envelope inser@@ ting ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ position or replacing the current marking system .
only differences display : files that appear in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options to Re@@ fresh the folder . )
there are only entries displayed to show the differences . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing in a later program version . ( the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in the default file .
note the buttons to choose the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of buttons , the lines from the corresponding window attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in the default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space , change their size , to finish it or move it . this works both inside a desktop and several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual space surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on an empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only two entries to set up ... and ending . however , if applied to an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if there is also a symbol and the name of the application , as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on work@@ space and ending . the orders make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
is this tigh@@ tro@@ field marked , can be windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , at &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work surfaces are displayed .
cross the field of the field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work surfaces display . if it is displayed together with name , the names will be attached with folder , &amp; eg ; 1st work@@ space .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; indicated .
when this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are displayed as small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection possible .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default icon and pixel . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main thread ; classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , as well known as out of P@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ ls ; wa@@ vering shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical series , which is very good for pointing side on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ bus program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , display the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
right click on the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent suspension of switches ... lets the dialog settings seem .
at the moment this cannot be changed in dialogue settings , but you can do it manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have any spelling for the file , you will need to register as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must assign the key to wind@@ ow@@ ic mode and assign this value . possible values are :
as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ may ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced by new functions . it is optimized for use on efficient machines .
when you like it , the window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ may ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window .. The picture that is displayed in enlar@@ ging window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , enlarged &amp; k@@ may ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor like a movable lens . alternatively , you can make a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor at the screen edge ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; k@@ may ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . this is always the standard shelf ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mas@@ on and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button depressed , so you can move the content of the magni@@ fier and shift . this also goes with the arrow buttons .
if you also use the &amp; Shift key , button press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the drop window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ head left stand and only the lower right corner to move .
&amp; k@@ may ; it has a lot of functions . you can press the enlarged picture directly to the printer to copy into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later to other applications ) , rot@@ ate the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . re@@ opp@@ en the update causes that the needed CPU time goes against 0 .
select the update @-@ rate ( Very low , low , means , high , Very high ) . the higher the update @-@ rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .

&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates just a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor has been in the same place at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ pen@@ al syndrome ) and each mouse @-@ click pains .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates just a mouse @-@ click on the same place once the mouse @-@ pointer is a while on the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the repeti@@ tive sentences in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click pain is processed . moreover , it may em@@ ulate the toes with the mouse . this does require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can cope with the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse . unfortunately , you may also be caused by the simple reason caused by the mouse . unfortunately , you suffer from pain that are related to your computer if this is not yet to happen .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain helps in clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the mouse due to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic agents , the result may be different for each of them .
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse @-@ click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the smart shifting is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a pause , after leaving the mouse button . now move the mouse button . in this way , you can run the pulling with pressing mouse button . the smart shifting requires a little practice , but you get used quickly to it .
this period has to be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a mouse click .
is smar@@ tly switched on , the screen@@ field is enabled ( 1 / 10 s ) actively . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse @-@ button again , if there is tim@@ ed no problem due to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; now supports the clicks by mouse @-@ shift . this function creates a slow way of left and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . this mo@@ tions are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can be able to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound buffer , which you adjust to a lower value in order to shor@@ ten the responses .
if this attitude is marked , &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; starting at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please click G@@ NO@@ ME or other window frames , please check the particular documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings back to the values that have been adjusted when opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button down , the settings will apply to the state after the last push .
best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; initially using the preference . in particular , the smart shifting should you first be turned off . if you then click on the automatic click , you can later switch the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to decrease the answers of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse @-@ click on without effect remains : the clicks on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not link to un@@ seas@@ oned reactions . you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse rests , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you clean not just the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you must pick out the mouse ball . how this happens , is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would need to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the bul@@ let was used . you can easily scr@@ ape the dirt and dirt road easily with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if this is just a de@@ port@@ edly started . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent moving tool , this means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation is no longer able to end the button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use one window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform even a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is reset , and you can work as usual .
problem : if you type text , tries &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to follow mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . however , you don &apos;t park the mouse on a neutral field of work surface , if you are a ke@@ ystro@@ phy . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with smart media , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart shifting is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you start to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and carry out any other action in which you want to move the mouse while pressing the mouse button . but there will probably be some advice .
if you do not use the smart shift if you just begin using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; follow text instead as follows : run the Shift key , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus each time is pressing a sound like a mouse click . thus , you know exactly when when smart reloc@@ ating the moving time . later you can use the smart shifting without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Wind@@ ow ; it should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and it is furnished correctly .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse @-@ mouse button once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is shortly ver@@ har@@ rt . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and to which the actu@@ ation of the Mau@@ sta@@ est pain is being processed .
&amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; it can also be configured so that there is a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling procedure before the mouse will release . in this way , the pulling and dra@@ ins can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the dum@@ b users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let the computer speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the course of the course , which should be talked again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left scre@@ enshot ) you enter the command , which is used later for the voice output of text . for more details , please see the description of the furnishings .
on the second page you can select the standard text @-@ password . from the text @-@ text books you can often choose text passages , without having to type them . the text messages can of course be processed .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) , you determine the dictionary for the chosen language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can list the wording with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only proper letter words can be recorded in the wording .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard hub of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a scr@@ otum of the already spoken phrases ( the top white section in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have a mouth ; correctly you can input the phrases which you want to hear . each av@@ owed sentence is app@@ ended to the cache . you can choose from it propositions which are to be spoken again .
with the menu item settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two car@@ part cards , voice output and settings , the page of Wor@@ ter@@ ies as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language .
in the input field of the press @-@ tab , you enter the command to call the voice generators . in the selection field below the input field you specify the character enco@@ ding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the tick , if the text is to be transmitted as default to the language generator .
if the h@@ ubs are not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the order to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using as kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth is used to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after the selection of a text @-@ period , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text @-@ in menu in the menu text @-@ password or in the bar for text enco@@ ding books .
with the selection of so@@ fort , the chosen text box will be talked directly and in addition to the cache is inserted . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text box is only entered into the input field .
with the second selection list of closing the editing pane for text @-@ powered book , you can choose whether the text @-@ script should be automatically saved in the closing of the editing pane .
with the selection of text @-@ based manual , the book is saved . if you choose to change changes , the text @-@ password is not saved . select pre @-@ saving , will ask &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text @-@ password is to be saved .
the site of Wor@@ ter@@ ap@@ tion contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary available for wording .
with buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to export the order of books , or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; finally reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply found by abor@@ tion of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to put only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then which dic@@ tion@@ aries are combined , and how they are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new inserted words automatically enters into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for the processing of text @-@ based books is split . in the upper part the text @-@ fitting books are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected listing . if you have selected a text message , you can change the text , or the related button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation . if you have selected a text @-@ password , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages or books , you may either reach the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text @-@ fitting books or text passages can be changed by pulling with the mouse on the new position or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer .
the selected text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the transfer .
the currently active phrase is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the transfer .
is this menu scre@@ wed in turn , is displayed a post@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu application is inserted in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu application is set in turn , a post@@ pon@@ able lease is arranged for text enco@@ ding books with entries . by clicking on the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the sha@@ ded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have the command for the voice output not correct or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth . set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the output for the voice output on the map output . ( see illustration dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to more details . )
the Festival is a Language issue of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows it to use Festival free of charge and continue without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language @-@ based speech generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows for free to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to continue without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS has been installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option is to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ estation , so you need an additional program to de@@ generate the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA is installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax willingly lend the last character of the text , so that an additional sign has to be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the VO D@@ äm@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; another language service available for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
as the setting of voice generators only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you must use only as kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to adjust the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , appearing in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot talk to release text by the calcul@@ ator . a list already is saved @-@ pro@@ s@@ er sets which can always release the user again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers contains . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you must install and set it properly . see also
at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the car@@ nation &apos;s spokes@@ person is displayed . see also . if you have created at least one spokes@@ person , the car@@ tei@@ card is displayed as well .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that is defined in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speakers .
various speaker for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several pressure @-@ tes@@ ters for the same printer .
if you click on the map @-@ card speaker in Can@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the car@@ p card speaker is displayed . this appears also automatically when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and still has no speaker .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for the voice output if an application does not have a speaker .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ . system .
select here a vo@@ coder , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a jun@@ k and gir@@ la voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the diamond card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts . go back to the map and check if voice output is disabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . now , you can use &amp; kt@@ ts to read text in order to create and manage text files .
if you have created at least one spokes@@ person , you can start the speech system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map @-@ card General to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this starting point to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start successfully will display the KDE @-@ T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this is the start of the KDE @-@ T@@ TS Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text messages and pre @-@ read . see . remove the marking , will be K@@ TT@@ SD , and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is finished , running &amp; kt@@ ts , on as long as the box is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this tigh@@ tro@@ field marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears during the check @-@ in automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text messages , break off , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the actual text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file to pre @-@ read . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click on or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the car@@ p card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map @-@ card General and cross the language issue ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; you can check the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read , and select in the main menu tools to read text . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step but then many &amp; HTML ; precautions and other un@@ seen brands also read well .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text shown before . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools to read text . then , the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ note is the communication system of &amp; k@@ de ; which will notify you of you . you can also read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can make a message when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears if your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ note , appears menu entries in the menu settings of this program . the options available here are different settings for K@@ No@@ fy depending on the application .
filter for string fix@@ tures offer a good option in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you will remove the tags and b from the news , the k@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box since it can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capacities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters the text is edited , before it is sent to the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , choose a matching language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain shortcomings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen readers may be read , the information is resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of warning .
messages have a higher priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that is used news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth . anyone who just enters the room . &amp; kis@@ ses ; aler@@ ts are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text messages . each order that you encounter from the car@@ r card is a word order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text messages . text messages are intended for the output @-@ longer texts , which have no special urgency .
all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen @-@ reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a lecture , this issue is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen revisions . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters in the future .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the inser@@ ting parts can give you either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre @-@ defined strings , allowing the creation of chat @-@ emo@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the form@@ at@@ ting of messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form allow .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML files .
with spokes@@ person , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has set the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have submitted a female voice for example , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter clari@@ fies that his rules don &apos;t exist , he gives the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text contract , a message , warning or a &amp; b ; notification is sent , it is edited by all activated filter that have been set up on the page . the processing through the filter is done in the order from top to bottom .
this displays the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter not irrit@@ ated , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed the line up from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter out , and it will be shown the further below furnishings .
to filter for the establishment of strings , you must enter a list of words or regul@@ ary expressions . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the associated replacement text . bulk and mini@@ ature is not observed when compared .
specify a name for your filter . you can choose this name , you just need to distinguish yourself from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regul@@ arity . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column and replaced it in accordance with the character chain from the column . the list displayed in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or regul@@ arity in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file that can save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only used when the speaker is speaking one of the languages mentioned here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
here is a value registered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the user ID run @-@ up programs will be available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers you have to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the user ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only use copies .
the strings filter filter will only apply to the text when all conditions are used with an entry in the box Di@@ ke filters . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared with words , the character of strings used regul@@ arity in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by parti@@ tions ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regul@@ ary expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations can be found in the bundle .
&amp; XML ; form@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the b@@ ail@@ out program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker , you can send a text to a particular speaker who is set up on the car@@ r tab , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can , for example , define that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts , gives a text to the filter , it is looking for a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties that the program gives the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speaker is set up by the spokes@@ person speaker . by speaking , you can write the selected speaker .
if the text is recorded here , the filter is applied in case the text contains the rel@@ ay regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations installed , you can call this with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
put here the qualities of your preferred consultation site . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to match the desired needs best . click the button on the right to view the dialog language selection .
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ aders , or delete all settings .
the spokes@@ person is only applied to the text when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box Di@@ d Filter if either . you must register at least one condition .
the voice output API , von &amp; k@@ de ; to lend its applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module , which syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ bus ; interface the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the box ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language selection services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
the text of the text is to pre @-@ read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , please enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . start only kt@@ ts@@ d in one window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival , websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able at all works . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain signs or interference signs seem to cause errors to syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that entire sentences may be printed or only chew@@ ing @-@ wel@@ d . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option code enco@@ ding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with particular characters or words , these may be solved by a string qu@@ artet filter .

the language syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices which own a separate license .
if you have access to the KDE Cor@@ de@@ archi@@ v , you can download the package file with &amp; kt@@ ts . in addition , you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ file below ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with each language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the Command Line in a &amp; Con@@ sole ;
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages at rate . also check out the page of kt@@ ops ; for information which are not yet included in this manual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts , for use of a different syn@@ thesizer , get in touch with the developer team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts , you need a current development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &apos; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts , from source text archives , or have downloaded each night up to date , please translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if speech disp@@ at@@ cher works properly with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . to this end , you can use the shell @-@ critical SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; which is used the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed so developed that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back Sat@@ z@@ - or exp@@ ire , repeat the output or break off .
if an application indicates that an application is attached to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request a female English speaker . if you have set up a spokes@@ person whose language English and his gender is female , this will be used automatically the best matching spokes@@ person . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , take a look at .
if you click on the Car@@ tei@@ Card Spe@@ aker to insert a spokes@@ man in the list or click on editing , the diamond card speaker is displayed . as an example , the set up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text that is handed over to the festival . in case of votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting is made automatically . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you make up volume , talk @-@ speed and pitch @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice you choose not to choose these settings .
some votes such as multi@@ sy@@ n votes require several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this starting point , these voices are already loaded at the start by K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with a lesser amount of memory ) , the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this cross@@ roads cannot be selected , you have not set up any speaker ( or forget to apply it ) .
if this accus@@ ations marked , is displayed at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s . otherwise , after starting the symbol is only visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this tigh@@ tro@@ field marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this gives you the opportunity to read or control it otherwise .
here all orders are listed in queue , along with the application that has set the contract , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the straight line . the speaker ID matches the column ID on the diamond card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can order a double in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or go back . ( but not every order is made from several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes made by the settings ( including on the other diamond cards ) and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s will be down@@ sized for the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to re@@ view the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here are only text entries listed and administered . expenses of Screen revisions , warnings and messages are not shown . for more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please see .
select the type of audi@@ tor . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either with support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ dul compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected Al@@ sa , select the PC@@ M device here .
make the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % suits approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal intercom speed . so these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click to apply the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ts ; to take over the system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose default .
on this map you can set up specific actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is dra@@ fted to all other orders and keeps these orders . once the output of the screen readers have been read , the information is resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning will resume the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can greet &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , you can see someone who just enters the room .
will a text order be interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen file , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output in the queue ein .
this audio file is always sc@@ aled when a normal text contract is interrupted . if the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map applies only to normal text messages . for messages , warnings and spending of screen readers , there are no special actions if this will be interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to keep up with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ note @-@ news pre @-@ read , launch C@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and click on noti@@ fications . the Car@@ tei@@ Card notices will be released .
mark this tigh@@ tro@@ field to turn the pre @-@ reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disadvantage . if this attitude is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read aler@@ ts before .
if this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears , where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message that &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nickname .
all events , for which in the list is nothing different , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . ignored .
use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event takes place . you have the following options :
if you have selected the defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder text :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired microphone . standard choose the spokes@@ person who is shown in the list on the car@@ tei@@ tab speaker as the top entry . do you see it too .
note that there are three levels for events . for a particular event of a particular application , this will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of certain application . as the last option comes the action to carry out , which has been set under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the aforementioned messages like this :
use the button save to store the settings for aler@@ ts in a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click on Del@@ ete . all entries except all de@@ ma@@ ges are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output , the intercom speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) because this is the default voice that uses SS@@ ML in the issuing of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or tape in the Festival configuration dialog does not appear on 100@@ g ; % is adjusted , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &gt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE speak English &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who slept in my bed ? asked mom B@@ är . who slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds can start reading text in individual sentences , as only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , as only the first set may be syn@@ thes@@ ized , or res@@ isting or stop back and vom@@ iting , even if the syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , it is automatically set up as a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can add its settings or add another satellite filter .
the easiest way to learn the arrangement of the spokes@@ man by taste . place the Spe@@ ak selection orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts . switch off the spokes@@ man orders , change some characteristics and check how the choice of the speaker is changing . you have to have of course more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then , faster with the pre @-@ reading may start , as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long .
you may stop or cancel text messages on the map , even if the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal satellite veins filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it can not be switched off , just removed , unless you know what you are doing .
Sat@@ z@@ bor@@ ehol@@ ding filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( tab@@ ular code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing border ( table characters ) in front of the fil@@ tering automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard Sat@@ z@@ sor filter can be included in the string .
SB@@ D filters are never applied at &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed an account of the normal satellite veins filter , you can insert it again by loading the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the map speaker , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the car@@ tei@@ card is displayed when
use of the standard loud@@ speaker ( the top on the diamond tab ) . in other words : no speaker properties are fixed .
use of the pass@@ able microphone , which shows all the characteristics of a standard microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom ; if you choose the settings of the speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts , the speaker , which corresponds to the original properties originally intended .
select the method to enter the desired language properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the qualities of the desired microphone . if this property does not play a role , you do not give anything .
mark this an@@ cru@@ x if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , this is always treated as a priority property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language , lies before , if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one described in the working environment .
to use all properties in the field of speaker , which is best suited to the following , click the selection button to use standard speakers and then use the spokes@@ person who corresponds to the following .
in this case 0 stands for the last word contract in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is required 0 ) .
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s immediately cr@@ ashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug @-@ support , but I do not get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you need to register G@@ stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to upgrade or install G@@ stre@@ amer .
the audi@@ tor over Al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I consider a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts . appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts arise at Al@@ sa , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have installed an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s does not show this voice .
add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ .ch / or the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL you have found the voice to the developer .
on the diamond card Audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and using the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive is offering themselves on the diamond card for speaker device . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts . ( this is because the HTML in SS@@ ML is converted . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the transformation of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML @-@ Per@@ former@@ filter , and use the intercom speed .
I didn &apos;t make it to be read , that websites with a female voice can be read . I have created a female festival spokes@@ person , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able Gender does not appear to work . that festival does not produce any error , the X@@ SL file re@@ jects the change of SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ Gender @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own string qu@@ artet filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not appear in a double bed or go back . on the body &apos;s orders is shown , the order just before one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
point signs ( point , question mark , cas@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter you . use for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ lim@@ it@@ coverage .

some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts with the audio issue . if your system also includes , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops . also , if you stop a text order and then launch another . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) .
with booth July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will still be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs .
if you have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ er archives ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball in a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a mi@@ leage of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the column configure option for shut@@ down the replacement shows the configure parameter which causes the move of the setup .
as a default , &amp; kt@@ ops ; installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not specified in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers work correctly . follow the instructions you get with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is attached . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can set up volume , talk speed and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help to get in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read Web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to compile an additional module so you need the source code of the festival . the german voices are subject to restrictions on the transmission .
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / imperial / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the Vo@@ ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ ische ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) co@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , you are looking for the first thing on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code should be adjusted enco@@ ding to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ on like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R , for example .
festival can be used in collaboration with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then generates the audi@@ tors . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival created this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; the Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts Di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
in this procedure additional wr@@ apper is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; please note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enabling the management of network interfaces , routine and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop devices via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; enabling the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical equipment and their drivers must already be functional and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices at installing &amp; Linux ; are installed and set up . network devices will be added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the core version ,
the module network settings is loaded when the network settings is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . when starting the module settings , this system tries to detect the platform at the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release version . by flag@@ ging the setting non @-@ again queries , the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means settings can only be considered . in the system administration mode , you arrive by clicking the button @-@ administration mode at the lower bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available networks are displayed . on the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced settings shows the dialog with further possibilities .
by choosing Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP information is required for each system start , so no further adjustment can be required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , can be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without your H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net mask .
if this attitude is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alisation is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not already be used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . turn off a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled depending on the need . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
sets the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub @-@ networks .
if on the computer there is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected , in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , the DNS replaces this name into an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 6@@ 7@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ esp@@ a part of the rider nam@@ esp@@ ace allows for easy handling of this list . entries can be added , removed , or altered wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a setup and execution or demo@@ tion in the list with the buttons or her@@ under in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group hosts a DNS server can be added to a DNS server . it will add to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Nam@@ eser@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from a group host to nam@@ es@@ solution , select an entry and then click the button Edit ... There will be the dialog editing .
the list of specifically known calcul@@ ator describes host IP @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally the list contains names of any known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still in the test run version of IP should replace 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machines and click Add .... The Dialogue of New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the famous host and click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add Fol@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the known computer has multiple ali@@ ases names , de button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button several times and enter the further ali@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a particular known machines from the list and select Edit .... The dialog &apos;s computer will be displayed .
one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking on OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , needs to be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be cancelled .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
for installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply the r@@ pm package to download and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult , to compile it . however , the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology will be given , in the second , all are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; Change Con@@ figuration files .
this area can not replace more detailed knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of PCs is given into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP address is to assign a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact person , which is a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a dedicated small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the internet , so their any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by hiring a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called Standard Route , the Zwe@@ ite the lo@@ op@@ back @-@ address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP @-@ re@@ direc@@ ting .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part the configuration files which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changing with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connection there is another content defined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a he@@ dging program for band drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to build multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to provide a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secur@@ es ?
before a band can be used , it has to be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done on three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat : re@@ ult the band and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad of the ban@@ ana . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pro@@ x on the tape is not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be form@@ at@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preference , it is searching for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band@@ index is to be re@@ created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the band &apos;s work to indicate that the tape was incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the ban@@ ana can now be searched through out of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the bonds , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; if there is a change in the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a message in the status bar . the tape can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without any danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat , can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band @-@ types have to form@@ at@@ ted before you need to be used for storing data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ at@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it must happen before you re @-@ form@@ at@@ ted from the volume of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy discs normally use a form@@ at@@ ting of the belt , DA@@ T drives , however , not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ at@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost with it ! after completing the form@@ at@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the ke@@ able files . this can be done on three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed by this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
highlight files in the local file tree with a h@@ ooks . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ zes ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to secure . the dialog indicates the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . there are only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test process has started , the dialogue will appear for re@@ viewing . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work@@ station for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialogue will be confirmed . this dialog indicates the progress of the test process as well as the transmission process and the remaining time .
before you can direct the Rest@@ ore , the files that are to be restored , can be checked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives files that belong to the tape . it is restored only the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a h@@ ooks . it is restored only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rest@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once the recovery process has started , the dialog opens settings for restoration . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the work@@ station for restoration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue will be re@@ producing . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process , as well as the report and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ ed file by the band@@ leader . this process sol@@ ves all existing index files for this band . you can restart the index on two types of the tape :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should be done . the list of the deleted files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , that only the files stored in the file system are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ esystem , you can register separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used since the last incre@@ mental file . it only saved the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ app@@ y file in front of the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons is inc@@ ts , and lt ; lt ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to device file for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ en@@ tion version of the band @-@ device .
if this attitude is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is included , the load is carried out to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the trigger in the band@@ head . possibly this attitude does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , the type of integration of &amp; k@@ dat is thrown out . use this option not in flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ s .
if the option is switched on , the hardware is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable score sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , the block size for your band drive will communicate .
if &amp; k@@ dat : a tape is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file will be composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , where billing is the complete name of the system , on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted .
the band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup type . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a B ; observer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where to get information about your system or where the system permits the different protocol files . furthermore , users can access quick access to information about problems that appear on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine does in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can access quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . thus , some advanced functions will provide , with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , puts &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort out . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system Protocol - will not be displayed , and it will probably not open up with system managers . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user normally no justification for reading .
you can also use the fil@@ tering bar to filter for selected filter lines . the list of the log lines will now be automatically altered , so that only logs in the filter box will be displayed automatically . in the default setting , the drop @-@ line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can of course select a different entry at this point . select the string of the filter protocol , for example , in the filter file system protocol , and enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines sent to you which have been sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level failure are displayed with a show@@ cas@@ ing color as protocol lines of level reference . the colored representation of protocol lines may be switched with setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . for example , it can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific instruction , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use fil@@ tering .
in addition , you can skip the option to jump new lines in the context menu of the main window , to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol on display in the menu .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own web page on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. dating you will find more current information on the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archives : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) As &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system rapidly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts in the &amp; Linux operating system . and therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ ar file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you will need to make sure the old ins@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it is also different from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you like to start the system or switching to another Run@@ level . system services involve such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services involve not such things like set@@ tes , which will only be started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also do a r@@ c.@@ on in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something out of what has to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level entered / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the set @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can re@@ configure / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . if you have a bit together , then you come to repair the system and execute the following :
but how does it start with all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like :
you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does it start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very easy : each of the scripts is written , that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start using these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes a C , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could make &amp; eg ; an server running level , which only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . , moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or any other pointer is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able System services on one of the six Run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or shift the position within a level by turning it somewhere else . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of Av@@ ail@@ able systems services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new zone . to simply select it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target area , even if the same entry has previously existed in the target zone .
the sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no possibility of recre@@ ate entries thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Av@@ ail@@ able System services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor buttons , to make a selection of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the button key to change the properties tab . use the tab@@ ular button to change between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or push Es@@ c to throw the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; modifications to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ IL@@ O Pro@@ mp@@ t linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and changing the standard Run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for the execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way the system services launched in these distri@@ butions , simplify the configuration for the proprietary layout programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you made changes , you must save it . either use the appropriate icon of tool@@ bar or entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is an easy application . the main window consists of two car@@ r cards , the user interface and the user group list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it will appear in the dialog user or group properties .
some car@@ r cards are displayed only if you have enabled extended system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , if you are able to perform extended system settings on which you can make individual settings . other car@@ r cards appear , in case Shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the Car@@ pa@@ card Pass@@ word management appears if Shadow @-@ passwords are installed or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this mapping card appears only if available for at least a single fil@@ esystem tree ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can modify parameters for each user , while the limited restrictions are limited in KB .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space constra@@ int
the car@@ tei@@ card groups informs about the group irregul@@ arities of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field primary group . furthermore , users can become a member in other groups by highlight them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add out of the menu user or group or click on the matching button button in the tool@@ bar . the editing or dele@@ tion of the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the L@@ IL@@ O Boot@@ Manager , remove the boot @-@ password , remove and modify the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , modify , modify and add more .
