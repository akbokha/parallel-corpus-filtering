<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the full & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babylonfish produced in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, we should not make any important decisions on the translation without the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated from the Babylonfish-page itself, where you can insert the translatable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & Konqueror;. despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & Konqueror; by which they are readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & Konqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual & Konqueror;</seg>

<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of portray folder hierarchies by means of a so-called Tree-map. each object is displayed by a rectangle, whose surface must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size is the size of a file or a folder, the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries is specified in it. accordingly, large files, even can be easily detected if they can be seen far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the treetting representation represents a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. to simplify navigation possess the right corner meaningful color and fittings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a triangle, which is switched on view color mode, can be either depth for easy detection of the sharpening table or the illustration of a different file name such as name, owners, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the appropriate file or folder. for each property you can specify if enough space to be present or whether the surface area may occur by limitations when signs of the Trevor). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Daring algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item. at the Treat in & FSView; this target will not always be observed. please note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square meter.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the area of an entry for subordinate entries is made, the implementation remains up. here it is necessary for the labeling and the prevention of space losses through the frame always advantageous the areas that arise as square. the best methods in this are lines, columns, or recursive second.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu item view. instead, a smoker pattern is drawn into the area of the higher level of entries to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) to data transmission. the camera will also be implemented as a disk drive. the interface can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras can also be used in conjunction with the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitization; use the program gPhoto 2 to communicate with digital cameras, which also supports an increasing number of more than 800 cameras. it also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transmission of images to digital cameras and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slowly outdated; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support, so that EXIF support is not read by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to read the thumbnails. if the EXIF support does not exist in libgphoto2, you might be able to discard nothing or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to check out is how simple its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitization; the Photoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the objective is to provide modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much easier to complement & digitization; by writing a small module to supplement a function as the changes in & digicame; ourselves perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page with & LMB; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">The drag and drop of pictures everywhere: you can put an image in another section of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal separation line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; digital stock administration participates, categorized, categorized, seeks, transformed, ready-assembled and exports content that habilical or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is provided according to your definition data, information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you don't even know more than 1000 photos on your computer. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't know & digitization;. the approach allows metadata to store both in a database and in the image files guaranteed very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you have to manage something inside your system. you need to decide whether you want to store other access to your computer, whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; notice that you must change to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found throughout your memory location. if you would like enough photos, then your subfolder like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. publishing of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% Archive and 5% working files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to save in the site of metadata in & digitization. this makes sure that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want to change? to create a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select every photo keyword, notables and a review. of course, you can select all pictures that you'll need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best pictures in the future.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now with keywords, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or category. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import katalogue images from another source of embedded keywords, then & digitization; automatically the tree for you build or put the pictures to the right place. the reversing of the Hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a subtree onto another. the changed keywords are from & digitization; updated while it persecuted the trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata can be cut. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists in truth from many sections. data-names and calendar data are qualities of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section relates to references or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let your photos just see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, space.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing stage of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy the 60 years after landing is. wow! you start dream, associations, memories, the historical time period is re-present, you might even hear the silence. so the caprification has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos is probably more important than the image to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help Him via the motif you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength to work only with an accusation for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised, you can use any amount of text in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8) as marking. you can even export it for a selection of pictures. if you export your images in web-galleries, then these signments will be exported to your wishes in the marking and / or the title of the Web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation can now already be loaded with speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to take advantage of the geolocalization are already uncountable and can be repeated in the future by means of pictures with geographical data. & digitization; can also export kml files you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and denotes the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of & digicame; as information left:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for author and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, such as the name of a company or organization. after which this value was saved, it should no longer be changed. this field does not support commas or semicons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Title: link with the author. this field contains the working-drawing of the photographer. examples of this may be titles as: clerk photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this must be filled out of the same as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the agent to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily need to be the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group / agency is listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they don't have any protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than base know in working with calculators, delete or change. the solution to this problem are digital watermark. for individuals, this is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. now, in the near future, such module can be made available for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: records, record failure, blackouts, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we didn't talk about CDs that lost on the road or fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can also happen with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must also buy CDs and DVDs within archival quality. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality. of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe this is in your surveying room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and put them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it turns to select the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you are just written only. therefore, use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ulviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs. however, there are also similar applications available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged floppies, hard disk, flash drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the FormatWar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and therefore almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual layout DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is naturally also true for Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a not propriated format. likewise, if you store the media with a description, date & author markers and thereafter on a clean, dark dry and outside animals protected place. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturer keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing ergers include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting of hard drives: dismissable study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: disks stay at the longest when you are operated in the temperate area of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperament, these errors will not notice the immediate accident. some of SMART announce the immediate impending failure. these are in particular Lesefehler and Verlagozähler. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the whole loss of loss due to strain. of course, you can also use data loss due to an electric razor before saving the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account much, that can cause serious harm. at your computer, these anomalies blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware age, non-destructive motherboards, and other defects. thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blacktips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that has absorbed a part of the energy heat and obtainable the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. keep in mind that not every plug-bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against flash and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As a transmitter of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be careful that also all peripherals connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage switcher, which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore contain very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection system protects your system from smaller variations into the electric lines, it will help you with a complete failure. even a fall of few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a fragile electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overtension these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. some models allow them to even continue working until the stream again. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life-time of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and and compare its security in electricity disorders with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be you for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected too. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions therefore only exist as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but there is no general security solution. for this reason, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com make online storage services available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not be able to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version will make you more available, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory what should be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data security, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically measured thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a shared memory. this means that they are disastersure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. filesystem and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred to you. all these disorders remain undetected until you have a photo open and this to your surprise is destroyed. nobody seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a considerably more secure data away than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power components are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interference within the data streams. in ordinary file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already, 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who are able to handle and scaleable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it will soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched an own initiative with its btrf filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective machinations the zfs used and is also available for & Linux; but it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace-systems. at notebooks, the percentage of thefts are 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most methists think. it results in a lower damage, such as theft or re-installation. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has long been sighted a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than EXT3, cancellation, JFS and XFS to name the common filesystem. a very good English article for this can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 Blendensettings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and smoking characteristics are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Current cameras are heading towards the 10 megapixene sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is available today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. secure your data frequently according to a plan and test this back before you do anything that's the reinstallation of your OS, the exchange of disks or the magnitude of hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes, you are lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster proposes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft unhappiness: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desasterbacks is always a non-local storage. bring your backups out the stairs up into the neighboring house, in your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a loss of data in spite of securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference security: a backup of the files which have been changed since the last end of the end system. creates a complete snapshot of up to two periods: that of the full backup and the latest difference of difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple times. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup is made. this protection comes with a versioning system the next one with the exception that it is only detaxed and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transcription copied rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security regarding ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or another optic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & ries; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly entry for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, association, storage, scalability, media, playback of images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewpoints,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">Doing so valuable pictures the next 40 year to survive that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future due to your nature unforeseeable, you have to look at all that is said today with caution and reevaluate throughout the time. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain vigilance. all 5-8 years should you ask yourself how the current system is backwards. the less variations you have used in the past, the more easy it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available today for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: everytime you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the subject to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have plans to enlarge the scalability and extend the area that you want to enlarge click on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and move onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but do not depend on them.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb / dev / sdc # source / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc & Dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBts; # functions with ext2,3, fatal 16, 32 and registfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of an iron if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software you can read, then you can create them yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format disappears slowly from the market. you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard developed by GIF. however, it can save much more. PNG can store gamma- and Chromity data for an improved colour assignment in heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage, that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF required and have a slow-slow result. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. it manages pictures in high quality, but requires very big files. with some cameras, you can save your pictures in this format. a problem is, however, that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a licence-free and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope to use the Canon and Nikon team at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has installed its XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms; a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a mixture of XML and quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers exercise it in front of an original of your shot, mostly in rough format, to archived. XMP fits, as it saves the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, you should think if you use DNG as a container and place everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata, which include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightened efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata's standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reading or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edit, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your Roharchive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a more subtle processing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut down by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in Webgaleria, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised; in the section of adding a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos, which you already have on your hard drive, but you can add many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicame; connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it into. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, this is trying to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, one heel indicator appears at the lower end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will display. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file order is displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you might need the camera information on each entry. using the page features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the characteristics of an item or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photographic information stored internally by the camera. a symbol shows that the image does not have been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, Productions, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as in the metadata page from the main window of & digitization; or the image processing. please note that these metadata are not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click to download, and then download the choice of all. this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in & digitised;. while downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can select only the desired videos settings from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download the select button until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new download now. these images have not yet been downloaded by & digitised; in this case, the new pictures have been marked with a star in the curtain window. if you choose this option, you will of course download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you choose to download the buttons all download or select a dialog, displayed in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums is displayed, displayed in the section My albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digitization; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by delete the button Delete. if you only want to delete a few, you must select them first and delete it by erasing.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to restore your camera from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; so they should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a & beta release; if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, you should do this over the camera, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually deleted once again, if you load photos of different recording spots in the same album. therefore, it can be sensible to integrate the date and time on which the picture was made to be integrated into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for datebased substitches. if you use this latter option, automatically a folder is created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three additional options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate to the corresponding entries from the EXIF data in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different file format than the standard format, you can use e.g. in the editing field the prefix photo-% Y-%% -% H:% S: change the option date & time. for further customization, you should read the help of the command line.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera data file, you will have the option to change the filenames in small case letters. or in case letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digicame; for a photo, it is displayed below the name that the camera will be available in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised, all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform at the time point of recording. not all cameras represent this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't supply this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic rotation off, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera records information about the date when the photo is made available, it can be updated to download automatically underclock in the target album. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. in the section sidebar meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case it saves & digitised; the photos directly in the destination album. if you want to change this option, use the button Advanced and select the option dating back at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos of their computer is to download their camera, is to download the button. then select a file text, you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & kde; Methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">Once the selection has been completed, asks & digitised; you, where the images are to be loaded up. a folder-selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. the identification of data can be indicated in longitude and latitude, and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to polling an area by automatic recording of GPS data to kartographic. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can click with a click of a browser which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised, users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it's good to save the positional data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, Sattelites and map referenced. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, through a post-processing of GPS data and image files using the KIPI module for geographic attribution (manual) and finally via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated with GPS receiver. but there are a few that work with GPS recipients to work together. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: coyasset Eye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and the GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; pspsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitudinal and latitude or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of hairy coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com to show no European road cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, who show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitization; try to change as much control over its working procedures as possible. to modify these settings, you have to set up in Settings. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can be displayed at embedded Preview or picture editing. you therefore place the default behavior of & digitization; note when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardiidentity and copyright data. this data is automatically selected in the appropriate IPTC data fields, if the option is selected when downloading from camera lens. even when downloading synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authorship is a synonym for editor: this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer. this can be designations, such as employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a detailed description of the author, it must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to provide the picture of the photo. this does not have to be the author as this is the image other & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo; then the group or agency should be enumerated here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the appropriate IPTC rim. it is achieved that the metadata constantly contained in the image and not only in the database of & digitization; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & digitised, without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images save as embedded triggers (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with which in the pictures were included. attention: in pictures that have already ridden already, these may be overwritten by the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all the options for the information they appear, when mouse-cursor in the main window appears on a file. depending on the selected option this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitization; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitization; to indicate which file types & digitization came; if any file in a & digicame; Albuquerner, which has no such extensions, from & digicame; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">Default settings can be reset, by pressing the button Refresh from any category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminous of & digitization; however, if you then access the default values, these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can only get better machines. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the picture editing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch the toolbar if you use the image processing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the picture editing, this inspection can be switched with F10 and F11 and be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images are coded into a higher resolution of the luminance than in colour formations. please read this article in Wikipedia about the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG used a lossfree algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and unpacking. if you have a rapid calculator, you can set this value to high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files you can turn the deflate compressing muscle for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the Deflate algorithm loss works.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting up-free JPEG-2000 files you can save losses. even if you choose the lossy approach, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was still not supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digitised, the picture editing only an image editor for photos. currently, it develops quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard annulfs is that all green pixels are identical. if the geradline green pixel of the CCD-sensor, this difference generates a minimum loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option features the picture a little soft, but eliminated the 2x2 gaves patterns with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-off of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white pattern is not set, default, it is a fixed color balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps will get more details on the edge-edge. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default it is the shotters, so the parts of your images are burned-in, because of the incapacity of your camera reboot the cutting-edge, as they indicate the cutting-edge in several Rosatrains. lastly, you can try some parts of the missing information from the shrews to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast secular as green and red. and dcraw thus try to reconstruct the missing green- and red shareholes from the still unsaturated blue pixel. of course, this is a matter how much colour or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">Selecting the option to construct a level, you get the possibility to set a level. here's a value of three a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminous according to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitised; picture editing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle-filtered image sensor that have many cameras and that has a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digitization; and Dcraw present you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. but it produces farms in edges. Bilinear is interesting if you're looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-softening of your lenses you can set the red and blue-proofreaders here. this is certainly the best method for a color error correction, as you are implemented during the shell.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color formations and prints instructions like this again should be given. there are also LCMS and & digitised; information such as the color formations of a color brewery can be translated into the other so that colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color administration module with rough files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digitised, these folders then examine during Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the opportunity & quot; default squelot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the white file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you are using. not all profiles are included in the same type. there are some such as Canon, which does not contain any color panel or gamekelasty. currently, dcraw Gamma does not apply for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color panel itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile which you emulate that your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. this could you manually correct instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious that color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not for the models of Canon. therefore here a table of cameras and profiles they fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for sceneries, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image owners and educational work. through the Delivering of this interface you can support and digitization; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these are then loaded from & digitised. these modules also appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings command command.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Slideshow should be easy to understand. the top regulator jushes the time between image processes, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other crossroads turn on the metadata one or out, which ends at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties display on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. if you want to use this, you make sure that the camera is connected correctly, switched on and in the picture-line mode. beneath this are the portals, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras from the camera. you must specify the path, / melt / camera or / melt / redesigning, specify on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitization; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digitised, the camera automatically detects. if not, you can put cameras and port manually after you have set your camera out, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any type of name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option of confirmation dialog for relocating &gt; pictures in the dustbin, you can adjust the conversation of & digitization; setting up a photo in an album. in the delete of a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right side bar can be tacitly used by & digitization; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without having any feedback. otherwise, you need to apply the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also tie the message of the check-screen of & digitization; at the starting point, it speeds up under circumstances the start process of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim start looking for new photos and digitised, the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this is prolonged the time-time from & digicame;. if something from the base folder has been deleted, asks, whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemas can be used in & digitised, to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected using settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple textfiles. if you are interested in creating a new design for check, find out more about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitization; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and fix the correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting ads / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture editing contains a set of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitised, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current datenummer, enlarging factor and the current picture size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge, and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of images editing your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo, before saving file or storing the button saving from the toolbar. note that you cannot revert the original photo as soon as you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be saved to file saving as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore menu or use the button reproducing the image processing in the toolbar. you will lose every change that you have performed on the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of picture editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting editing, or restored, by selecting editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, ctrl; Z for reacting and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the back-bar or Restore button in the toolbar you get a single click menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigational toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the log menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarging factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full-screen mode shows the photo in full-screen mode. you come into the normal view, in which you want to use the Esc button. if you do not want this, you can visit this in setting dialog of & digitised; you can view this in the checking dialog of & digitised; you can view this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File menu and get the standard & kde; printing dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print out single images or whole sets. you'll only need to select images with standard methods and select from the menu album exporters. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicame; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page is available, even in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple-clicking on the same rider leaves the sidebar appear and disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the marking view you can input holes with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is permitted UTF-8. that means that all special characters are allowed to be used in EXIFT and IPTC- fields to allow you to use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are created after 2000 characters and are formed by special characters. if you want to use the IPTC registry box in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on, use either the button, or simply switch to the next picture, the signments will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the use button there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always performed if you have selected a metadata setting, which is always written into the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting bings. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sampling view displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously published in this & digitised, session keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sampling tree is adjusted as a dynamic to the search word. you can easily restrict the number of options in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief for the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marker the corresponding crossroads in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, and select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, If you want to select a selection with a keyword, please refer to the sampling filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - filen-, keyword and viewpoints. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the cutting of these two displays. all provided keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and discard it. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. subsequently, a dialog, which you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example the main window displays the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter stands on No keywords, what are reduced to three pictures. they were pulled with Strg + a, and after that, a keyword was removed from the right keyword on the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be switched under settings differences.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and created and find that it would be one or its, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and in control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is being sought in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a wiped search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the tick-box at the end of the rule and after that the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. thanks to Elle for this work. I basically worked on & digitised, s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow, which have the colors available from your camera or scanner, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner, and the colors that you print or publish in the Web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to colour management, everyone wants to press which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour management. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all the criteria specified below, you must not worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sGB farms. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture purchases are by e-mail or the web where sGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So when sGB works so well and make life for all so easy, why should one use another color brewery and thus have thoughts about color-managed?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the Limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we really see will be presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB farms, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensionals of sRGB with some larger farms, then visit Bruce Lindblooms website and then click on Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I kaline my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB farms?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working on sGB-farms or not, you need to kallibrids your monitor, since sGB works on sRGB. so if you are working as in the color brewery of sRGB, then you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitoring profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. use it before you try a further manual work.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions are normalize the same, automatic, and contrast, from the menu Korstier automatic correction, trying to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the luminosity values over the overall picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color shades. this feature is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method juscated the luminous factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensive service is as flat as possible. thus, the equivalent very good results obtained in improving the contradiction of an image, sometimes it also produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in one image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic Absame: this method maximizes the color area in the rot-, green- and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright border tones and juscated the rot-, green- and blue channels on the entire histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast enhancement: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by drawing the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a novelty of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-immediately of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-tip correction is somewhat restricted as over a colour brewery with 8-bit per color. if you can perform too far from the original image, can perform areas with overexposure. in case you work the white-off in the shell mode, your possibilities for correcting your correction are better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a whitish artery of the copyrighted by Pawel's Jochym. you start it over the menu input colors white-like the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window display can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side are both the original image as well as preview the target image. if you want to see the original white picture again, it is enough to click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixels below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is displayed as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small Luminchers. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is shown. the sum is called Luminumance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shade, saturation and gamma off. the shade can be adjusted you can improve the shadow details of your photos or reclute.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture show around which selected colors for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white-off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure of the pixels increase the colors, if more than a color channel of the pixels is overexposed. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons save as and loading exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set, you can save to save in a text file and later download it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button preference creates all filter values back to its default values and the associated-neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo as your original. if you save it, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the code stickers per colour channel of the edited image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding requires also more disk space, calculation time and stands onlyre for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialogue as the editing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed guide for using color profiles, you can draw the chapter colour administration at rate.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of clay correction. this tool provides an integrated path to store several color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistakes and therefore always require the same correction. in the manual for the tonvalue error, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way of correct exposure problems is the tool for redation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool paint effects presents you four coloreffects, a solar system effect, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a canoe filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar isation was also called Sabine, also Sabatier. the colored, dark areas sheltered from the extra light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity control the solar isation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible. a further increase creates finally a negativity that is not to generate on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and this is edited (2). the applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that it makes a stronger contradiction-effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight-optimized color movie which is produced by the Japanese company Fujimovie. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colours are also a few photographers, especially those who are scarcely scenic, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight in contrast edge. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlyts. in large pictures the filter can choose the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to review the color counter and illuminating the photos. you can preview the different shades of your photos with the tools in the menu below colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big satiation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation will reduce the good choice for satiety instead of raising them. if Him like the result you can confirm the changes made with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple upright / contrast / Gamma the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need only the area of slider. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the Intensity values, an Histogram, the active canal or the selected area. under the graphene, three sliders are inserted into it and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the regulators and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, using the settings of the image, updated. on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the Histogram is frequently displayed with a linear or logistical y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic use will be more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three Regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colours pinpallets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically jusite the shade of the shade, middle and bright sounds automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Gawares allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two Regulators that can be used to change the gastrite interactive as in the intervention rate. the compression of the exit status can be used for example, to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the data set in the filesystem can be saved and later reactivated. in addition, the Gimp is used format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pallets, the input holes will be re-reviewed for all the shade, means and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for red, green-, blue - and the Luminator channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposure of indicolator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview, and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the intervention rate applied to red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the gagarated are unchanged. the original image is with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side the half of the original and the target image is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications Canal: this selection box allows to indicate the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures with a digital camera, linear mode is mostly generated. for pictures with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you, for example, move a short panel to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds with darker pronouns, and that the associated images are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the preview of the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker in the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move up and down until the value is placed according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: using these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you have created may be saved in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is the Gimp curformat.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipallets buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, central and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the rot-, green-, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overexposed indicolator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is a indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview, and it's no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo, which has been corrected in the Luminous canal. shadow and Sundays has been applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicame; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another advanced tool to mix the colors of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel box, you can select the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing. the original section of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed to compare your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: regulators for red, green and construction allow you to activate these channels. if you activate leaning, the image will retain the overall brightness, as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrom, the reduction of a color will appear to a visible noise which does not appear at the same place in the color canal. if that is the case, you can improve your monochroment conversion thereby in which you will reduce the color-brewery first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender-setting can therefore save it for later and then load. this file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposure of indicolator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview, and it is not an effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the Blue Channel has been reactivated. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the working image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white a working progress, since color models can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollers profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure to a green liner filter. this looks good, in all the scene images and fits especially well with portraits against heaven. so much like the 004 Cokin (tm).</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure using a orange liner filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film exposure using a red Linsenfilter. this creates dramatic downtimes and can simulate the moon-time for day-time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm).</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates an black / white film exposure with a yellow linsenfilter. this is the most natural shade of color and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones as it adds up a bit of cold in the shaft. this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & checking, tool texture allows you to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color picture or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry picture texture the image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right raises the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicame; tool frame can add a decorative framework to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative box. this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye. under picture frames, the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set up the desired frame for your picture. thoroughly, the picture completes with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), picking up it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonator and decorative stituting a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range area for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame designed target image will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in an image at any spot. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use text message, orientation, color from the color dimension and the character set with its characteristics as you need it. the larger the picture, the larger the character size must be. at the end, just choose a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already, the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "any approach that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press" "" "OK" "". "after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicame; tool stencil, you can put a stencil over an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Schablone is used in image processing can be used to lay stencils over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, if you want to add the PNG file format and you should add with maximum compressing (9) to defile the file size. if you want to add your stencil of defile; just send an e-mail in English to the & digicame; mailing list checking came-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for a first time, you need to set your template folder with the button basis folders. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils was published a tree-view, which reflects the folder structure of the Schablonenordner. selecting a folder updates the thumbbar of the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">The preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlarging factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button shrinks the underlying image. if you want to apply the mouse on the full picture, you must reduce the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Just use OK if you want to apply the stencil to your image. the image is then automatically adapted to the thumbnail size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitised, three different tools for the edge is available. each one of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened, a traditional tool is a sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Insharfe mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. indeed, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric caverns and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of the sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution are adjusted to a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more tolerating than normal cameras for the private application.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG pictures, it is often applied to a camera of internal sharpening. images in the shell format must always be used during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners turn a sharpest filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable them, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can obtain usable results by calling a photo with the edge of sharpening throwing. that can call you with the menu-entry Korrigidity.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should deal with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the most suitable technology is refocus on the tool frrefocus. you can refocus it on the menu application corrigidity. among refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpens.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than sharpens. use the tool to softer with the menu application corrigidly and experiment with settings. the default window on the right side of the dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mascot is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can you see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help the picture to process. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blister mask too strong, crawling and get the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected on each side of a channel through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radios. you should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The sponge value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and applying differential. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt from sharpening and thus beauty errors avoided in faces, celles and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp filter. the original image is the (1) and the working image that (2). blur masking with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora value = 0.0 applied.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicame; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the protected protected development filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to refocus a picture. this is better approach than just trying the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus on a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. refocus mostly better results as a blur mask. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung works much better than the Gauß'sche barrel. the Gauß'sche barrel has a very long tail, which leads the mathematical result from the source pixel that is far from the original torch pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse the Gauß's Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular bassplits. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred but then to hales.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help thereby reduce artifacts. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smokers should help you to reduce artifacts. however, the filter can help values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 can be beneficial. however, if the smoking filter is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will still consume the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche focal: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use these parameters as your insharpening Gauß'sch. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid outgerent artifacts. if you use a value inequal zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoker filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the Transformationsmatrix. however, an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great value for the circular sharpening or the Gauß'schen. however, note that the module will be very slow when you choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocus parameters that you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cuts, color and Intensity jacket on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but left later unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read images and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Mascant produces better results than sharpens. this could be caused by blur a larger neighbourhood than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking ever needs to generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never able to show the effect of insharpened filters. it is practically the result of the FIR Wiener filter at least as good as the blister mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture was taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to an insufficient light to the Auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of acentral correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smootte sets the insharpness of the area which was blacked out to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tints allows a customized color for the pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error error is one of the most widely developed tools to remove the desired artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Indies algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as startup points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fuse the filtering settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailed drainage p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a higher gradient of the image. weighed up greater values mainly homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should be given details such that no focal point should be subordinated, always under the direction of addiction, should be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Ridding addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granation or CCD noise will produce a high value wavy pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum reduction factor above allelongp then defines the relative smoothing. therefore place this value up to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoother, as it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Reps: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally there is 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-step there [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha small is chosen, there should be small angle a long run. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step of step [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels grading and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the More to quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low. but he doubles its running time. we recommend him to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons save as and loading exactly this. every setting of image errors can be correct in a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load after it. hence, you can cancel calculation at any time with the demolition.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture bugs have been corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied to a photo that is caused in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar black list during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization; drug reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease images. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool sets out selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory input from the camera or motions; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensor parts of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular smoker that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain at the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can convert the image. the area specified by the radius is moving over the image and the color in it is harvested and thus yield minor errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the focal point. this value sets the pixelabut the filter to be ascertained. if it is increased, you may change the edges filter if you change this attitude. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer get the noise or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-accuracy of the filtering. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the whole noise or noise-tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a swatchful noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details controls.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color-tolerant of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothness process which is controlled by the details controls.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolanz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker ranges which are typically more consuming, to increase. however, it also tended the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of Phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted. if he is increased to high, noise and phosphitter may occur at the edges. he can remove drugs and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set may be saved into filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and that corrected with (2). the smoking reduction was applied with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too scarfs for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to softer with the menu application corrigidly and experiment with the smoothness. the shelf-window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo-quality products.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts about your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove palate, compressive, compressive, compressive, compressive images, compressing, compressive, compressing images, and thus gets the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text replacement. using a different tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Franca's and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG facts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compressionism, he generates some compression & quot; artifacts quot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed image. this attitude will correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons save as and loading exactly this. every setting from photo recovery can be saved into a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo recovery is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load after it. hence, you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with flat-shaped smoking. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous movie grains on the faces. the original image is under (1) and that corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo recovery. this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by the scanness lighting and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitization; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixel of photos taken with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms of the JPEGPixi project that are protected by Martin Dicklop.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly in high-quality raw material photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button. the tool will detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to record the dark image directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defective.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to correcting the picture. an automatic processing of the dark is to find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last stop and this automatically invites you to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and preview help you correct the result within the picture. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all the fields of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixelsticks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">During: it is determined an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting colour will be assigned to all broken pixels on the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a gap of 1 from Pixelblock (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less about Pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to interpolate the pixels on the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) to interpolate the defective pixels on the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a colour photo, from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization: vignettierungsSurgery is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foresible lenses, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often not illuminate the whole sensor area. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. tellenses show under certain circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has disadvantages. many Center filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 in the Blendenfilter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. further angle-objective should also use with Center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise immeasurably effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing areas of today's filtering and color-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalence transformation by using a Centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the VignettierungsSurgery and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light foam padding at the point of the biggest density the filter. the default density is 2.0, which gives an optical filter with a blending attitude of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, unpredominant, reduce it to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and Gamma-settings: the editing of an image with the vignetting corrections reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to recommand the exposures of the target image with these options. the Regulators show you only positive values since you just need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer turnaround of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitised; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting corrections applied to one image. the original image (1) displays the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a leuchastic and contradiction correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitization; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treated the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convexe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar broadening effect, flawed but at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades corrected the remote corners to the part of the second grader. if you combine these two can be eliminated with geometrical distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second grades. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values of the verular distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the engraver. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters has the reverse parameters of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scale up the image size and thus leads to a correction to the first degree of grader by. negative values scale down while positive the image increases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value jushes the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogs with a preview the distortion error. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- or cusp-shaped correction should be performed in front of all cuts or sizes. the best way to cut this correction as the first one. if you make a picture anew, and then perform a tonic correction, the effect is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction. move the mouse-cursor in the picture show around the dotted lines. move it into an important place, such as the bottom or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. following you can fix the tongs / pad-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a pad-shaped distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can use it with the cutting-tool in the menu to remove it from image processing or using the zoom controller of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the barrel-shaped correction is made. the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of toned-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture under (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web site which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a awareness area of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">On the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters for top-grains and filmmaking (ISO). activate the color of the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of footage and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) as a transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter colors for reproducing infrared movie, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the colour formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filtering, applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the working image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the shreins.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter movies, is an easy to use tool to reproduce footage onto your pictures. this is of classic high-speed movies like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. in order to increase the sensitivity of movies, the manufacturer's major silver-grains of photemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight specifically in your monochromen photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains are calibrated. the default value is, although often higher values need to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of film-grading effects applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the working (2). this used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitization; filter oil gems generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitization; filter oil gems gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top chooses the brush-size between one and five. thicker brushes are better controlled for big images. smooth brushes controlled the smoothness or, from the other side, the scarce.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is with the (1) and the working is characterized by the (2). brush-size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and glasses 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & checking came; Filter coal-drawing is used colour and Intensity to create a carbon shaft. the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed. images whose gradients are slowly changing, therefore, if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline you. these would be good pictures to start.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator chooses the foundation size and the lower jushes the contrast (glasses).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherent filter. the original image (1) and the altered image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adapting the intensity value even further.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & checking came; Filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & checking came; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to turn the image into a gray, demonic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth does not allow the contrast to the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the working image (2) used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wavelsticks 1, the image here is distorted to a different version of glass blacks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo in an artwork by using imsharpness effects. it uses protected algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: caught the picture along sternfoggy lines that comes from a central point. this simulates the insharpened camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial insharpness: caught the picture by rotation of the pixels to a central point. this simulates the insharpening of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance-sharpness: caught the picture to create the effect of an unfocused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion Insharpened: caught the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the insharpened movements of a linear, z: B: from a car or train photographed camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft-resistant ounces: caught the picture soft in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour-photos or add a warm and subtle incandescent.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk-sharpness: caught the picture by random shift of the pixels and simulates thereby the insharpening of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent discomfort: finds the color sink in the image and caught this without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo in rectangular cells and created it then, by filling with an average pixelvalue, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a nice small tool to make Regentropes on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a fun appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn ghted material algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Trough size allows to change the size of the picture. since the dripping size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of drops. fishing changes the visual effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free of regentropes with the & digitization. use the tool tool to select the area, e.g. a face that shall remain free of charge. if you start the filter check-in, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropes Filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the working image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu of transforming turning or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to smaller out is simple. the big question is how you can blow up an image and hold the details sharp? how can you find the missing information again? how can you find the missing information again or guessed? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try to inflate the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="635">The aspect ratio is maintained: if this setting is enabled, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio is maintained by the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoother, as it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons are saved as and charging are used exactly to it. each insertion for photo magnify can be saved as text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast at what it does, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load after it. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by adding a small color picture to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard Enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common operation, but also a commonly underestimated tool to put together a picture. in order to cut a photo, you simply need to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you want to release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. thus, you will get a good overview of how your photo will change after cutting the area by moving to the corners of the square. you can create a new rectangle by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut-section, use the button The access button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File save under the menu file to save the newly cropped photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the field of view, you can change the size of the square by shifting the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue remains to be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In accordance with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and in the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you use centimeters, Inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their side ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogs, two buttons exist around the selection automatically horizontally or vertically to center.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in dialogue with the max. relation to the area to cut the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizon horizontal or vertical). if you use the access tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data are reflected in the EXIF data and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the work-aid help allow for help to put your pictures better together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of the similarity. like the third elregel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to form a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the Golden center is a division which is on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the bletters of a sunflower. it emerges in all possible things that we feel as nice.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used in ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures. the escaping divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually followed by visually, harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The Golden Center provides liquid relief lines if you put an image together. these help are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal good results for your photos. in comparison to the third elregel creates the golden spiral, a liquid line that leads through the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visuals.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called Golden Correctangles. it should be something that the eye looks at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or just being there without the eye it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also depend on the top-discussed golden spiral. keep in mind that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are no equinkling triangles. diagonal of these lines may place a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to break up your frame, create an effect that is called by professional photographers's dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal directional and vertical flip can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliaries can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any corner.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it happens easy that you don't keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things turned around a corner. you can repair this with the & digitised; image processing and tool free rotation. choose to do this transformer free rotation and jusite the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are in degrees specified. with the button preference you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the spin is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is free rotation of a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor in the picture show around the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now justate the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned an image you will find some unwanted holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function transforming it out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option of anti-aliasing wires the picture a bit after rotation. please note the above-mentioned warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All the prospective transformations are performed to a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialogue, you will find some information which can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation are in pixel.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixel.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top: displays the current angle to degrees at the top right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have the perspective, you get unbearable holes in the corners. one way of getting this to bersome is to cut the image by transfigured out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool-tool is used to move a part of the picture in one direction and shift the other part to the opposite. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transformation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your picture by using the horizontal corner and vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press preference, the angle will be displayed at zero. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line ends. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the switching tool to justate your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shot, the image will be caught a bit. for a single shot, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots empowering twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After switching the picture has unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image by transfigured out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitization; required a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiles. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats in this place. however, you will always be able to find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digitised, only files in formats used to the list. this happens according to file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file is displayed in the list. you can edit this list of file extenders that change & digitization. in the section configuration, you can find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras will even allow you to select the format. a fuller description of these file formats you can find in Wikipedia. and digitization; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compressive procedures to digital images. thereby redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there is better, smoother results than JPEG, in the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the Roha format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous club and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert media format images in JPEG or TIFF. in the section configuration, you will find further information on the use of modules with & digitization;.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; it has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphviz; -dot; graphene with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; at. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (so that a change of graphene in & Kate; the graphene recomputed and presented in & kgraphic viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu, to open the graphene in & Kate; to open or to open the graphs in & kgraphic viewer; in a & Kate; -component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading of large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than this node)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kesh; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the presentation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. in the beginning when you start & kgraphic viewer; in this case the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Finally opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">Once you have selected one or more & dot; files are selected, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the Graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can select with the context menu, select a firm position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization makes tools available to localise images geographically in the spherical coordination system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used here.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-Format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to guide the menu above, you need to load a column file with GPX file. this file contains naturally data that were recorded at the same places at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loaded a automatic correlation, which lists the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdates are recorded in GMT-time and hence the camera should be reversed with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. get here your camera time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum period of time gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camazeit. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the time difference between 2000 seconds then will correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and differential in min. can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is placed in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these limits here and then push the button correlate to interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same location. since the dialog box you need to use the coordinates from a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set up with the displayed card and enlarge it. select the appropriate region and enlarge it. the height must always be selected manually. the card can always be changed manual mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftpool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>

<seg id="823">The module has four horsemen in which the settings can be adjusted. they only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenchschau and the text of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely created by itself. if you then click on an image, a new page is displayed in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the picture will be displayed directly with your default picture, & eg; KuickShow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your images. select a folder with the name KIPIALExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original paintings will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With any other color-deep set you can change the default colors. the file size of course also influences the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider curtains allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. push aborting the process to break down.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically shut down. you can therefore read the programy choices in order to determine if mistakes were performed during the generation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press closing in order to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Bildchter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import -function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the file text dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you hit the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodier module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodier module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, using a defined length, convert. this module also uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All pictures will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide bar. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures which are to be packed into MPEG Diashau. after that, you can create the module via extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then enumerated by image files in the portfolio. there you can also modify sorting of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed. a lower value creates very sudden, a high on the contrary very smooth image-changing.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background-color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave them black. the name and path of the generated file you can specify under name of the MPEG-output file. keep it possible to keep the file mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file on the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can start creating the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can go quickly or in all quietness a coffee and enjoy the seashjam when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoding or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MYpegTools and ImageMagick packages to adjust the settings on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer resistant allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper together in standard photosets. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened using image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your data into one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original part of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera records. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that is to be converted and launch the module. the Raw image window appears then in mode for a single image. you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now reuse the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be used for the white. the essential parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be traced. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the end result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces for it the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you intend to edit your pictures frequently or you later otherwise, you should not select the JPEG format, as it only allows limited number of operations before the image quality has deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a memory format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data file.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker mode allows you to convert multiple images at once. use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically rewrite. this is helpful if this has been created in a previous attempt. a preview is not available. the progress bar will show how far the conversion progress has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compressed all pictures in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all pictures of an album. you can use the prefix, the Starscore, and the timestamp of the albums.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the picture smaller or enlarge. in addition, four types of images are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal magnitude in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, according to the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): magnitude change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not disproportionate growth in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print processing: preparing the picture for the photo pressure. the user can set the printing resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, Randstad and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the extra pictures before. other pictures can be drawn on the list of images and discard it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the photo window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you. you can add more pictures to the button. for the last selected image a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and discard it to add the list of images to your image.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected images are removed from the list of images.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail clients. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected by you are attached as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of your emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is stored and every time it is used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download this here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a hung file, the comments are added to the pictures in a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adjusted under lossfree formats such as TIFF. therefore, we should use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG using images file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original exifpics are added to the images of the images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically closed to you to view the status messages, in search of errors, but your e-mail program is automatically restarted at the end. with the button, you can unlock this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module of advanced Slideshow. you'll want to have a window with questions like your Slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images on the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will be activated very elegant image outputs through OpenGL. however, you need to possess a corresponding graphics controller, as otherwise the dip au will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option will display that the filename of images can be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop makes sure that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, it is not used by the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between pictures can be the temporary distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard. however, the best distance depends on your machine and your chosen transition effect. you should then check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly chooses a different effect on each transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">While the slide allows you to access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stopping the Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen, you can see the current date name, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has not yet been documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-Imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets out the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenu, as the background for your KDE's surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbum; through this browses, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the picture, are now available in each group, so in persons, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will find the categories for which you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. additionally there are entries to look at the EXIF based information, see the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following each one is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can see with thumbnails, to view the pictures of your interest.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & Started album; however, for each person you can store an own image, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the toolbar. in this context, please note that you can display the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and simultaneously display a list of keywords (if you do not possess appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image is to be displayed for each individual person. now you will need to display the image editor, as shown in the picture. here you can select the image editor's entry. in the log-window you can choose the enlarging factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the image should be shown or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the entry in the main window, a dialogue will be displayed showing the dialog for fixing the image characteristics very similar. this dialog allows you to look at the picture again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string into the marking or description, the wires or descriptions of the images may be searched for. if you want, you can also enter a date, for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all pictures according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & photophotosets;. if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and have a look at the quick entry, the screen photos and the introductions videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Run & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialogue the demo, in case you start & rip album; for the first time, or select in the menu help the menu input script: -demo. subsequently, some examples are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotosets; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you data about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, showing only 10-minute viewpoints.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use on the following ways interactively: you can edit the displayed entries preview of the database (if you select a date, the first image will show this date in preview images) and also displays the timeline always the current date of the moment you showed in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time information. if you select an area, you'll preview only pictures of this timeframe. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& calibrated album; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & photophotosets; integrated in the following part of the user guide, integrated in & Started album; integrated version described above the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and purpose. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overlooks and a description which is to contain the HTML file later. at colt album; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & colt album; export file will be created on the overview page. nutritional information on export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. therefore, you can avoid that information is displayed without description. for example, all pictures are exported from a party. for example, all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific pictures from certain amount.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how to look the HTML pages. most settings are clear why this is not made specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">Down on the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. thus, those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer's viewer can change the resolution at any time. so, you can browse your pictures with lower resolution, which leads to a lower transmission period. if he'd like to see a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting section, you place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to choose your HTML files for all your HTML files, and for any subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you will need to select the root folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and set automatically at the next time. thus, you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if they're really all for viewer. if you have created for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created. the URL you can specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If you find the HTML files not included in the final target folder, you have to manually copy them manually. thus, the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are available.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings options described above have changed all three at the base folders and URLs. in this, a subfolder is set, whose name you set in the subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; to come together, you might want to use a HTML page to viewing the pictures. however, if you already have a lot of time for it, the pictures, people on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & candlphotoalbum; this work is not even possible.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Set album, you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. you can import others into your database. the image properties are imported to you with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored with the file, or if the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of all pictures in the file can be saved and this file can be passed on independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file directly from the File Format... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the pictures in two ways. first, the images are not found in the folder of .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using HTML-export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog is described for the export of images you can export via the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .kim files, the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you make a manual close to the .kim file, you must copy the pictures in the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim file, copy & kissing album; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it usually does not feel uncompressed. if you want this, just select the option of export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The final option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that every image should be at a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Format... select it, & colt album; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import is made up of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you own the category people of the imported file (if you are a Dane), while this category is in charge of your database. that's why you are to be imported in the third dialog window, which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can edit the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse images and watch: when you look at images, you often want to watch pictures of your Italy holiday and watch a picture with your friend to discover, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will pass the different steps from (1) to pass the information about your pictures, via (2) the passing and watching, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptation options.</seg>
<seg id="948">Kphotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today your videos. in many places in this handbook will talk about images, but frequently it also includes video with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& calibrated album; stores all of his information in the index.xml in the top folder of their images. it is a simple XML file, which you can copy with a program of your choice, such as Normal securing tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notes the folder in which your images are stored and uses this in future Starts automatically. if you once again want a different folder tree with pictures, you can run & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. as an example: cold album -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu item settings kphotosets; set up... come to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotosets; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you will see six different symbols, with which you can view the preview possibilities and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call for a button shift to the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In case you describe how to set for each image different properties, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a marking and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section sub-categories were already mentioned. in dialogue options, you can set up complete members of members, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all the groups of a member.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view of the setting options available to you for the determination of the members groups, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module with other graphics applications, such as digikam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this handbook as they are not part of & photophotosets; however, most modules also have a help-page that you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">As the modules of multiple applications can be shared with each other, it can be that the modules with & kphotosets; therefore, you should always test new modules first by using the demo database before you access them via the command line with the command &gt; No input\ &gt; or over the menu help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules using KIPI, are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kissing album; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & colt album; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are also using their images in albums: it is an album simply a folder. even if & colt album; this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order to albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulated & photophotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all pictures that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album needs to be passed on a list of albums; the modules also pass a list of albums. here's the photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & rip album; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, use the category people, it will be FREE. so, so if you have selected persons to view and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotosets; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select the modules that modules are supposed to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a startup screen once you start & play album with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you'll see the window, with which you can browse your image database. at the moment, you will not have much information about your pictures. in the section, we will return to this window, but then click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & quot; is the possibility to see each image with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture. you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes simultaneously. if for example on all pictures Jesper is illustrated and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when you use the built-in observer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists using a text box by choosing persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & mpt album; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to push the images within the list: if you have a family celebration and are illustrated in all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, so you can find that the names used upwards moved, the people can find and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to have a alphabetically sort list, click on the icon for sorting after date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any notes for each picture individually, you might want to edit all selected images and provided these pictures with notes. simply click on the button and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight these images and use the menu item multier entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overhead group. to show you that it is an overrun group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comkungsdialois it can add an entry to an existing or new overload or subcategory. in addition, you can also draw an entry into a category and discard it to make this one subcategory of this item. attention, this requires that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see it.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can shift the individual elements of the Compreset, by clicking the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by drawing it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so adapted to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely out. if you want to get this window later again, use the button options... and here then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you display the entry pictures in the browser you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or any images in case you don't have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply clicking the mouse using the middle mouse button, configure. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this is displayed in the picture frame. if you don't have a window opened with a picture frame, a new ad display will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture show. simply select the appropriate images from which you would like to delete and press either the Delete button, or select in the Edit menu selection. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& calibrated album; for this problem you can have a solution. you can also use the photo album, without you saved on your hard disk. in the picture you will have to see the pictures somewhere, so if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, in which the upper upper left is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so you can preview images of these images. however, you can also preview these pictures with the image editor.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function needs that you need files from the folders and to copy again. thus, if you want to avoid the introduction of the question in question, so if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures, please buy a larger disk in order to store all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you filter the pictures that you want to make for other inaccessible and click on the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also check all pictures that may see your little sister, contaxed and menu item All but current views.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set out which images in the case of the case are to be hidden away. if you put the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, eliminating all the images you have blocked, click lock. if you want to get the pictures again, click Sperling.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered into the block of images. to set up this password, simply choose your password in privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. for example, all images on the disk and on the other can either read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to those who are familiar with & kissing album; not very familiar with the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all of your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours of course that you want to see them sometime. for this reason, & photosets; for this reason you have an image video. you can preview it from the preview, as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows of course the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, e.g. who is in the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily drag the mouse and discard it elsewhere. you can also configure the information displayed on the viewer. all these options are available according to right click on the viewer. then you can see the right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the appropriate entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as a dip tank. how often it loads a new picture after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and plus or minus. started and halted the diode by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer's viewer's viewer is to change in full-screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch in full-screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer in the image and turned out zooming. you can easily pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can check back rerzooming The Plus button zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the uniformity show the zooms, so that each pixel corresponds to the screen a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations that work with videos will work in and wired up with the plus and product key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the screen functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this doesn't work with videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. at the moment you can watch the interrupting and configuration dialog of the image to view this name. however, you'll perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or poorly, while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For both examples above, the observer gives you the chance to view images with characteristics while watching them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can prescribe a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, if you have all pictures that you edit, print or whatever you have chosen. this is described in. afterwards, you can use one module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can display in the thumbnail view. if you can display categories in Dre preview view, then you can press features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case, you are allowed to paint your photo album; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the type you can revert your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In addition, you can see a picture on the painted age. to switch the painting mode of & kphotosets; insert in the image painting from the context menu. to finish the Malen you simply hit the cross in toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray, but the documentation on & Povray; you should absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the subject object of an already selected object, since all the items are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu input in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following folding menu ends, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the right-click menu of right mouse button you can previously remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered properties, click on to apply these changes. have you entered invalid values, a message is displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and then click on the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the layout dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object using help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the Featurk view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in Featura view and a small sample of the scene is becued with the chosen texture, even if you want a subordinated item (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">If a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and spin. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility of visibility. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal in the toolbar selected visibility of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order, or if you need any other arrangement, you can set it as you can. you can also save multiple shutter orders and just switch between different arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window overlooking or under a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the fitter to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange multiple views on each other, drag the starter on a different view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map of the map in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order are float views: views that are not enshrined in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop or click on the small to the left arrow in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the toolbar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between dart and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you can find entries for any type of views. new views are hovering, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view... save it. a dialog appears when you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can renders it. & Povray; 3.1g for renders, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renamed the current scene, click on the symbol Render Render in the toolbar or select the menu view scene view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to renders a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview up to fullscreen quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar or select from Render modes... select the following dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each race mode has a name. you can input any name, it is a name that can detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the body-card size you can list the width and height of the image asset. if you want to renders only a small area of the picture, select the cross-section section and give the picture cut to renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combinational field quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; to renders. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model for a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user's manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is traded with just a ray per pixel, there may be different errors. these images often have a Moiré pattern or stool effect in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally speaking images of this property are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is constantly regrouped and adaptive because every pixel repeatedely spread again and adaptive because the recursive loop depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if you adjust the difference between the pursuit of a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a lowering value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values, then the pixels is shared in 4 sub-pixels that can be followed separately and set to further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set up with lowering.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another option reduces the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of smoking for the beam process, called jittering. if you turn Jittering, the rays are changing to a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendernns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which diffuse diffuse light-reflexion. it takes very long to make a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this page map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if the related rays did not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens up a new window for viewing the & Povray. if & Povray; if cancelled, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the menu entry file imports... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command-run of & Povray;. if importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; cover this code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object harness into the editor to export the source code for & Povray. to import objects in the text file. to import objects in the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insert in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray-command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene retreats. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in equity view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set here the path to your documentation and the version. supported the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example in height of rocky) into the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The paint for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the triangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type markers.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detailed amplifier for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High detail fidelity for extended projections, all projections are used further when the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections using exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renders.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall lies behind the objects. the wall is displayed in a chboard pattern of two single-adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you want to display ground, a soil below the object is curb below the objects. the floor is displayed in a chboard pattern of two single-adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate canosmoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information on parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the section window frames are explained as you can create window orders and save.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational field standard window arrangement: displays all existing window-orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window-orders shows all existing window-orders. a new arrangement can create you with the button "" "" Add "" "" button and delete a selected arrangement with the button "" "Delete" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be unambiguous and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order. you can create new views with the button "" "" Add "" "" button and delete selected views with the button "" "" Delete "" "" button. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unrestricted windows you will receive a map view along with the previous view and webing anchored the view not in the main window but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow without the exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, taking beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should keep the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for a first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set the camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Insert no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get just a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faulty, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following address:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and existing symbols of toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can expect a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item to delete. so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderment of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, see the content of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation to & Povray, please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instruction, but note that the camera in view points can change with which you can change the point of view of the camera. simply click on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the button, or press the button bar, change the wire-views and the object-tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a quader (insert final body quaders) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a portable method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simplified way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the button, or insert the button bar. in the object, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only as limited level. if you renders the scene, the level extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can view the object harness exactly, you will find that you can click the icon for the floor if you click on the icon + before the object. in this case, you will find only the standard options for each new object: scaling, spin and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line, just allow you to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to adjust his material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a little stream at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select the name displayed in the object tree. you can preview the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only displays a matted black material because you can still use settings for the pigment yet. now think the colors for the pigment. also, there are many possibilities to do so, but take now the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't have a color on quader and ball in the thumbnail, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now adjusted properly. if you want to rename your image now with a click on the icon, you should receive the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you have to have more settings. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called monochre. then select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already simply run this step as you should have understood the fundamental functioning of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the properties tab, you can instantly change the settings. adjust the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the ball button or button), so the ball has float above ground. otherwise, the ball would float above ground, as you have shifted the floor to a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click the ball pigment, select then select and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on or push the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings sheen effect and reflection arise already partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities offer you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Rayyycing is a renders method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you have a scene raytracer, shoots the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the beholder (i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the renderer is calculated as this ray through the objects reflects and broken, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects may impact as for example fog. thus, the scene is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be hindered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item allows you to only select if you still have not saved modifications in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last one-made command. this menu item allows you to only select if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to modify the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new command to this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the commands using this option toolbar for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-map is a way to pre-smoked finishes without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a dump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes, which you can use as components: very complex 3D models are made from dozens, or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on a pixel basis, using a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickShow; it is a convenient image editor and browsers. the application has a file browser which allows you to select images for display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; it's very easy. the file browser lists files you can see with clicking the & LMBn; or the button returns.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if any image is displayed in a separate window, or if all pictures are supposed to use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just tap the first character of the file window in the browser window. then a small entrance field appears in the lower right corner. if a suitable date is highlighted, the file is highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing returns or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface by Amarook has many general functions which mostly can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP-functions from collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts. an example call for the DCOP-function pause could look like:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarook supports the lines-lines from Qt and & kde;. in addition, Amarook has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of any lack of addiction. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use cdialog so the user ID, why a script does not expire.</seg>
<seg id="1186">BEGIN require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for Ruby) from kdebinding ings v3.4 is required for this script.' kdialog --sorry '# {error}'</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply add it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can replace your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be attached to every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the export of external programs and commands. it is usually called the function exec (). in this way dcop &gt; is called relatively easy. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, they should monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to view the furnishings dialog. to save and loading the furnishings, each script should take care of each script. if a script will run, Amarook sets the workstation to the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">Trackchange signaled that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volumetric Change newVolume signaled a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClile: submenu item, contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be clicked, so that the script can retrieve the clumsy entry. to remove an entry, you can use dcop Amaroscript removeCustomMenuItem (submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook; terminated, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarook; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to work for example recording data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script-administration can also install script packages that can be downloaded the user & eg; downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.zip 2), so that the user clearly can recognize the archive as a Amarook script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarook; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the grounding amarine script. for this reason you should name your script packages right right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to receive file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and hang the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarook. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarook; script script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarook; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarook; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarook requires only the package of Kdelibs and otherwise no further KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs therefore installed (including the programs included in it) because & Amarook; requires some of them to e.g. add modules or scripts). we have compiled a small guide, how to compile Kdelicate minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD indicates that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. we try to support Amarook on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt because they are providing an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Taglib library. you can check this file out by clicking on ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amaro.kde.org and also hang on the kaputte file that has caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and make the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most mostly it is that Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Tagb developers below bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarook; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarook, used by libraries with the same compiler version. if, for example & Amarook, with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.x compiled, then this leads to dismantling the Meta-Information.</seg>

<seg id="1465">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project. it is useful if you have files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you have files for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included, even if this function is not used for you, so that you can see the files already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project. this function leads us to remove files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this feature removes no files from the medium, it ends only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD-copying dialogue. this allows the copying of a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only create an image of a CD which you can then burn then later. also, there is also the possibility of buying instead of normal copying. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Open the DVD-copying dialogue. this allows you to create a DVD to a different medium. alternatively, you can also only be able to burn a DVD containing a DVD using the copying dialogue. furthermore, there is also the possibility of buying a DVD using the copying dialogue is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to absorb the entire (video) data of the source mediums in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1471">Burns a previously created CD-image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, for this, you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso file as a data source, which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previous DVD Video can be converted. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be used alline. it contains information about the footage of video, code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here, general programmations can be made. nearly all functions of & K3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended for personalisation and fine-adjustable operation of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kisses; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface also, with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; to use the Cdcop functions, you can either use the Command-line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are vital in functionality, so it's more likely to convey to your taste and the type of your task.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the Command-line program dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; to make sure you need to make sure that & K3b; then give something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that all have to have in common, supports & K3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP-Interface by & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPrecreateErvixDVDProject () DCOPrecreateMovixDVDProject () void taseCdrw () about void formatDvd () about void formatDvd () about void burnddImage () void burndvdImage () void burndvdImage (KURurl) void burndvdImage (KURurl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: # K3b --audiocd and then you can get a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject Durch in this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addateFolder (QString Parent) void TrveItem (QString Path) void removeItem (QString Path) about void setfull ID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files into the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once has to be made (the setup dialog, however, can be accessed as often as a suitable configuration), on the hard drive. this leads (hopefully) to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will frequently be proud of at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main introductions dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various mapping cards (such as encoder, to set up the Encoders). here you need to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoding and compressive rates and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss of loss audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information through data compressing, lose according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG can have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio-quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important because both codiles produce very good audio-quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'freely, lame is still provided with most distributions available free of charge but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high quality sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or one computer based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car-stereotype. today - initially 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio-quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autoimmune systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely wish to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which manually entered or obtained from the freeDB program via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / needed to create & kaudiocreator; and the co-service program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with code programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here. the manual or the help of the code explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switches must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... set {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters used to be used (= button-drawing in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs to upload the information instead of to enter into the computer. it is to note that here only is spoken by text: & CD; titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the eberries: in this way, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; information that are publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither can the artist nor the music business are attached. all information may be obtained at a Bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtual, can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; actively choose a crossroads to choose (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (fake) address given in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address will not be used in retrieving the data (This may only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freeDB, the geographically will be taken to use of freeDB. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrors for the online call of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program-program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that to use cdparanoia; who wants to know more accurately, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the displayed WAV files, the encoding and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at the first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the body. other code can be added at this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodier package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also required for the predefined code. for more information about encoding are found in the chapter of the Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers, more information about his switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolation window (eg. Console) must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, writing and readability, and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio code of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, all setup and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' use MP3s with an VBR (variable Bitrate) on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">It must be cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found, as it is not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have screaming on it (eg by trying to copy it into the Konqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setting up of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each release & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the drawing code for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting key quality (MP3) as well as the audio format (MP3) and which structure is used. since we are lazy, let's share the program with the freeDB to load the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be reading a & CD at any time; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the read program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive can also be specified, so a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries available there for the & CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The carteies - General settings. here you can't do much. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is shown as well / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for full information ask, so that you will be informed when information concerning the evidence of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The carteicard CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the reading of the & CD; to be connected to the Internet, so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, is a & CD; entry found immediately the reading of the & CD;. this is associated with low risk or filenames or tag entries, they may be slightly modified with queror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is to keep in mind: if you want to manually enter all the selection areas and freeDB is not used. however, this over 620 MB large, think about this. however, this over 620 MB large, consider these two selection fields to be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following carp card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for the retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server over the Internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about freeDB. set everything as it is illustrated in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the site freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way, the load will be distributed among the machines. however, this setting will function as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to what the server affects, because many firewalls are bocketed by the protocol 8080 because the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB servers. the first turning area should be deactivating.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is available on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously eseen pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author knows not so easy to try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: crossing this to the & CD; throwing at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want to cross this folder, then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. if the field is not folded, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget to do this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything is to enter as it is on the screen shot. the command is slightly long, under circumstances something needs to be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio-quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio-quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio-quality and storage power.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1.1.. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later modification of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously coding WAV files: in a dual core or quadcore, or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you've chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is structured on the hard drive, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will have to be picked up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any tapering & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet included in freeDB, see the screen photos a little different from those for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of taking it out of the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done so now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window, moved up.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and length should be listed in the window, just like in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as audio CD; could be read and could be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD; successfully completed by the freeDB, all the titles of the pieces are already filled out and in addition, the artist's name and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key to your & CD; there will be a window to give and you can select the database record, which your opinion is best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have selected the crossroads for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger a local database, but the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E-1.2: the CD-editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot, enter the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Upeller title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be typed in the input field 'Cureller titles' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments or sequentially per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful withdrawal of the data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album name (e.g. if all words with uppercase letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1-tags. this limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you have ID3v2 tags. this option is set up on the code tab. let's take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all cooperations or file formats. see the code for the code to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, which is obviously related to the style of the outputty CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>

<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked out will be read out. a simple click on the row switches the selection of the piece, or numb the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is over. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3. thus, read and code will take place parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can Open... from the menu file select. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from a & Konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and numb the button 'button in the toolbar, select the entry to play out of the menu item or numb the spaces.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts once you drag it to the & kmid; (with multiple pieces, it will be added to a collection and then replayed one another.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; one piece is playing, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and cycle with the regulator and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the tempo. to get back the original speed, double click on the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The blank spaces has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space button like a pressure on the button 'break or the lockout of menu navigation in the menu piece, therefore interrupts the playback while no piece is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text bags, others use lyrics, and some other both. some pieces do not have text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the Egnat type is automatically chosen to activate a song, so if you choose to adjust the automatic text message. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an apignant type, select from the menu settings the entries of text events or orders. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. in this section you will be able to use the collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To put a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the beginning the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application this collection is not saved. concerns you when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button addition. it appears in turn, the file dialog, with which help you can select the song's desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the attitude of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is activated, a piece will be added to the opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection will be activated and then added. this collection will then be added to the further opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played out. if you choose the array after the submenu of playable menu of the menu, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or remove random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the shortlist of the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the key arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump around a song again, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the delete collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is definitely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all the events of Type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always leaves a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need MIDI map because all Soundcards GM are compatible with (including awe and CIS cards, FM units and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Sorry, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file containing all the required compositions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section must appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">"" "Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP" ""... "END Define KEYMAP" ""... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">They see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboards will be illustrated. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches are in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you are not allowed to change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All Keyboard To M is needed to place all notes that supports this instrument to put the tone with the number M (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun plate. to add this to the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (gun signal), it adopts Patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum patch of the patch is meant to represent a different percussioning instrument (drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the tonal of the always same drum (like him have some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify such sounds on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you just need to use different names on the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to form notes on the perklock channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form a few channels to others. if you want to change the first and second channel, make it easy to change in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion to have a certain channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N the channel is shown on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap uses the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, which try to change the patch on this canal. in this case, will be used as patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the performer patch on the PerkPC channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchyderratio will be multiplied in which relationship Pitch-bending events will be multiplied with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimalcommas are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM proposes that a keyboard, which is a pitch-bending event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, but try some keyboards to play two notes up to an octave. to try to try the correct value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found under settings, point MIDI settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole string of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this claviatures you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the button is no longer green but red, to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to view the played notes. view in the menu settings under the point of the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing what a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same marks in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I cannot force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file requires about 50 KB, while an mp3-file requires 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binder distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have this happens because & kmid; without awe-support compiled, you need to download and install the problem (for example from kmid; 'home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; choose all the files from, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, activate the setting of automatic transmission to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD and to slow back the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & B; work surface a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; when I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file) or intercept a file, only to the & Konqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the hiring of automatic transmission to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. do not only want to play the first file. so make the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid, and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me that, go to & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you simply want to make me happy, write an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracus.es</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. either, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when there is information in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections with the menu bookmarks, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of contracts, which are played by each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchplates. if you have an entry, his group and all his subsets are copied to the current category and the playback starts with the click entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist may also be changed by directing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & kmplayer; do not run through the application itself. simply click on a name of a category click on the menu view and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content is displayed in this section.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu playlists and select either the editing mode, or choose another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc and changing from [general Options] No intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup needs to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would result in the end-animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the ads of a favourite image: & lt; his / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; and lt; /]; im source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider to the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path can be set from the Mplayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayback c. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swf-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be played in the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">That the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages can playback, the & kmplayer; module as service providers for the MIME-type Ix-Shockwave flash in the furnishing dialog file allocation of KDE are specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & kmplayer; is to start in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library. the stuary process is called crpplayer. if there is no error, the backend issue is within & kmplayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">As a result, a blueend for a particular MIME type is taken (of course only when this was found), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaywc. for example phonebook will replay all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using a player or Xvideo (this may need kxvplayer). before TV can be used, the scanner must be used as the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in kmplayer is to use the dialog in settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; Xvideo port. there should be selected ports that need to be selected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use Xvideo, Xvideo should function also (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux which is only working). for this reason, the videowill need to function properly for the XFree86 server (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMPlayer for sources different names. at the time of origin of this documentation these dvd source, dvd source, source source, tvanners, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start with the playlists of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. using Unix-like systems is likely to be applied to the package & lyrics, respectively & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution should be included. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; project contains some already compiled packages of & kile; for various distributions. these allow easy installation without further compile and are listed on the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This handbook is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with latex;, & kissed;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users will probably have to read this handbook. however, all proposals concerning the documentation is taken into account. if the support for this project or the documentation is desired, the contact via the kicks should be established.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions about or when compile it; on or if extensions desired, this should be addressed on the mailing list kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>

<seg id="1749">To find out more about & Kate; and his opportunities to learn should be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right choice: Lay-TECH. very difficult to use is also a Laie (engl.Lay) and latex; -macros use. a less challenging but realistic rendering is that it is from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">So here just a good chance to be latex; given, it's not the ultimate book about it. to have a latex; A Guide to & latex;: Document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just like other identification languages also includes & latex; an introduction, with which the general features such as paper format, sidenumbered and text color begins with the command\\ 'class, the kits begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-entry assistant of & kile; is a useful function for quick creation of a document in & kile;. the selection of assistants (MenÃ ¼) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document. you can also use some of the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is hereby given to the type of document [article], book [report], book [report], article (DIN) [Cartcl], book (DIN) [Cbook], projector [beamer], films [prodoner] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this character encoding is adjusted. modern systems should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 coding as standard. in case, UTF-8x should be used (for correct processing of the latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most used supplementary packages for latex;. for the involvement they can only be explored in the crossroads.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the Documents of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users are now unable to worry about. it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in this section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; it's just like other source code editors - the emergence of the used commands, attitudes and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & kile; if you are not closed by the modest appearance of the output file, however, it will help you through the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save it through the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command, by entering a new command (e. g.\\ begin}) of & kile; automatically a blank page (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the closure of the command. this function can be disabled in the amount of settings; set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most important and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When you view the document in the structuring, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click on the respective window.</seg>
<seg id="1763">In the creation of your own latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own or latex file (engl. D e V ice I nness File)], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; spectator at the corresponding line in the latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the format document and also other information such as the font styles; or latex;. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and uprights.</seg>
<seg id="1765">If you are looking for the elements of DVI, the elements of the DVI; file containing the editor used and once upon a item in the DVI; file text is scanned. once upon a section in & latex; source code was clicked, becomes the corresponding position in the DVI; observer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other integrated .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be adjusted to project preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if no errors in the source code are available).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File increase: in this mode the DVI; file on the existing enclosure, on the site, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quickening process.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In consideration of the editing toolbar, the three steps were developed in the document. the selection fields were developed for the fast links of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... the available and latex; commands given for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection range more is the introductory of articles such as tags, fox, fox, or spelling. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for the reference to a fixed name (selection via a selection range).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. for the editing of & bibtex; files are corresponding editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ re is used for defining the tyrance. there are the font to the main text, the joints, etc., there are the following correspondence to cover:</seg>
<seg id="1775">In the call of & kile; there are two choices for the purpose: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting up the settings. 2. the document may be written from reason to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays down the font. if the tyrants are not at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code was typed, the latex; source code has to be compiled. the easiest way to do is to use the menu or button-fast.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code should be saved before the compile. & kile; for storage automatically out.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Logs in the document errors, should be searched in the log-way according to errors. if using rapid construction should be started. if this is not the case, it should also be considered the log-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document. for example, a report containing the font size:\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment}, then the complexity of the tyrance into the area of Riesling. (English).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked within the surroundings (from\\) {environment} to\\ end {environment}).</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for measuring the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fatty printing, couplings, etc. are added. these commands either end with the command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin}: this command is for the course of the courier and is long as long as it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be illustrated with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Once the background for writing the source text was shown with the latex; Selected language, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistants a bit of text was entered, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to this end, mind. a quote, a few places in fat and courier and a poem to be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, using Editor view or Strg E, can return to the editor (in the internal observer). at an external observer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a remote file format (engl. D e V ice I nness). these files are created by & tex; or latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -conversion or computer imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file is the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar multiplied the transformation of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the transformation can begin to recalled other formats using the buttons in toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">How to search for the first jump from the editor to the previous position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; files must be set up only Modern under settings Kile... tools building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to be searched for the selection, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and should be clicked on request. the jump at the corresponding location in the DVI; spectator is then followed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this feature in & eyepie. with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; open and used on the corresponding line. to this end, & kile; used as text editor (settings eyepiece... editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If in the use of fast-installation of & DVI; spectator, there may be a mistake. should a mistake exist, this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file imposes the error source in the source code. in the Editor, you can view the errors in which the error appears. in order to consider the faulty line, the error must be clicked on the error in the log and & kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button in the toolbar is clicked, a window appears to select the template for the document. the features presented are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting leeres document, a document may be written either from scratch or the wizard to create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Cavity users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates, in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be created or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting from a document template. create a new template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using the file, some strings are replaced by other data (such as name or drawing coding). these variables can set up in settings ckles... settings generously.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering documentation:\\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$].</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and the associated entry for the commands in the editor. once the document created in this way was accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then your own template is rather than the standard of standards.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any number of latex; files will be created in a simple way to create a template, should be sought after one in the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the availability of reading and heredity of many different types of text (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be made in the menu, directly from & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more about & Kate; and his opportunities should get to know the manual for Kate. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be invoked by the Help LaTeX Reference. you can find an optional description nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with penetrated Strg button to convey the & tex; which means that in this way by clicking on\\\\\\\\\ ', only\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">In front of the text with printed linear mouse button, the text automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons with penetrated Shift, parts of the source text can be washed in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source texts and to highlight these ones. for example, the latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants you can add some of bookmarks within the text. the menu accentuated the jump to the next or the last jump-stamp. also this jump-mark is highlighted, so that it is automatically associated with the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The machining is probably one of the main aspects to use a program like & kile;. although & Kate; many attractive features were added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; special orders for their selection. under editing, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">If a complete paragraph includes a complete paragraph (group of lines included on both sides a blank lines). this extended meaning slept with that tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only preventative thing in & kile; thus, the only preventative thing is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Wns the word under the current cursorposition. this choice also has an extended meaning, since this command also latex disposable; commands with a section (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To LÃ ¶ ffing a part of the document can be removed naturally and by wiring the button is removed. & Kate; provides with its own commands given to a faster result. under editing, the following commands are included in the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of editing paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in latex; therefore, & kile; for NF further precepts under editing environment for an easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command extends to the beginning of the current surroundings (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the place of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jumped to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the rest of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the command\\ drive {environment}, it is jumped to the end of the surroundings (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the input of many squandered Environmenting commands can be quick to get lost. in this command, the most recently created environment, so that the narcoed ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups that are determined by braces {...}. under Editing TeX-Group are a few important commands that correspond to the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jumped to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the swollen clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will be jumped to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the vaults.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the weighted clamp of a & tex; -group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many squandered groups braces can quickly reach the completes ahead. in this command, the last used group, so that the terminated structure of the & tex; groups cannot be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a license for purpose. for the end, the sign is used. & kile; do this case and for two fall, the sign for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double sofa characters can set up under settings Kile... LaTeX and be exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use any specific settings (e.g., german or French) and thus German or French may be used. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">For example, for Shift; input-button, a smart pointer type. if the current position is located within a lists area (such as enumerate or itemize), for example & kile; not only a newline but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a tables environment, t & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an adjoining sign-off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be kicked up under settings; establish the LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the fissures in tables and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; try to invent it. while this tabulator is not the same thing, for it & kile; some intermediate space for the fissurposition of the current table.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code has been installed in & kile; in order to get special commands (mostly for & latex;) still extended. these are three according to demand and the other two are available for automatic reorganization. all of these modes can set up different working conditions under settings kile...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {surrounding}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When the rest is the last letter of the input, the last letter is removed, so that the list of lists will be reduced. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, descriptions can be dropped by & kile; alternatively, jumping marks, so that a simple jump to these positions by means of the springboard NÃ ¶ ste jump is possible and the added parameters can then be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; establish... kile; Versions can be made to these lists. there are different types lists for & tex; - and latex; commands as well as WÃ ¶ rent of the general language used can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is inappropriate for the termination of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to follow. on the other hand, the environments are used as often that & kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">In the call of completion mode or the keyboard mode, the command will automatically logs in the area and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient is continued on the easiest way and by the input, the input will be completed.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been accomplished, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a lists environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; establish... kile; use settings to these lists. this mode uses the complete list of completion mode for & tex; - and latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supported by custom lists of detachments which are immediately replaced by LÃ ¼ lower strings. as an example of a subscription list, the file is example.cwl, in which, for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is typed and the word processing mode has been replaced by the character of stre + Alt whiteboard, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Jobs are not helpful for automatic amalgamation. however, it was found that many Waters have been written in a document more than once. this provides & kile; the execution is already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menu kile... Kile Vercomplete. here, the Corpora value for the ad can be determined.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / dresser / the Persian Home folder. mode stands for designing (subscription), Dictionary (Wrrrerbook) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics are designed the insertion of graphics as easy as possible. to the background view of the basics of the graphics formats, the sections should be considered and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS -files are not as well known as PDF files, but can provide an excellent basis for the enrollment and re-orders of pages. will the download pages be modified with a few & PostScript; tools can be modified and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to watch the results of work, the source code must be compiled. all components tools are grouped in the menus to create compiling, creating and create a view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source text, such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used to be keystroke Alt; 3 by means of old; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file and by means of old; 5 the PS file is viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command fast, it is usually called a spectator after compiling. should not be used as a one-based spectator, each time a new window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will introduce the project New Project.... here the following information is asked for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1860">The API scripts have not been developed yet and can be used in further versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First must be said that the switch environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">Latex; is a quite pronounced system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; provides a lot of different help to support the user.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& Tetex; and & lyrics live; are delivered with many documents. in this includes documentation for the contained packages and a further latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete refernz for & tex; and then, on the site, is described, but rather a full-way manual for the & latex; commands and is ideal for those looking for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Based on the amount of documents with which & Tetex; / texlive; the use of the correct document is not always easy. alternatively, the small application texdotk offers that a database with all to & kile; transferred documents and given a graphic superstructure.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the most significant advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team manager as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose to look out of the list of members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and the button set as pressing. currently selected member (their identity) appears fett after you are: text.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard string encoding: the coding of newly created or otherwise displayed as a file opening files (where the coding of the file can be passed). however, this attitude here will be transmitted from the same in the projections if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. but this attitude here will be extended from the same in the property characteristics if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regular backup copies, so that in a power cut or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even if not stored documents is regularly created, according to the given time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in a separate view (or documentation in a part-party), which makes it possible to see the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the field of mouse click on the structural tree brings the following action it is possible to change the action by clicking the structuring.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural-tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in changing the structural tree will be set automatically. empty nodes are the empty fields in the text, while blank groups are such, where no element in the current document was found.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are KPart-applications from third page, which can be reused by any part-capable application, at the most known & conqueror;. when inserting an plugins must be given the following:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in, if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plugin at the start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in the "Only-Lese" mode download: check if the plugin is denied the loading. only-Lese-KParts, usually refuse the store, when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is this activated, then tests & quantaplus; if the specified information is correct. then, the saving of the plug-in also allows, if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the debugging is completely new developed. Diesupport for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was adjusted, as well as the support for the dbg Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which allows various implementations over plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; adds.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a proper debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the button options next to the Debugger plug-in selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content is displayed by CCTV variables. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it divides the plug-in to listen to Debuganos. this action is triggered by default if a project is used, that it normally does not need to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart of debugging session starts the session. concludes the connection to the debugger or terminates the leaves to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to direct a debug requirement. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the Debugger edition.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Shows the debugger where to start executing the script and to send information about the surveillance variables as well as the currently executed line continuously. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution is continued before a debit request started, the script starts with the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger where to start executing the script without sending information to surveillance variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution runs ahead. happens before a debit claim begins, the execution starts once a requirement is provided.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger guides the next instruction in the script without responding to the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next instruction in the script, whereby if possible in functions and includes in error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Shows the debugger to move the instruction and go to the next one as if there were the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the removable value appears in the variation-view.</seg>

<seg id="2041">Complete all the fields required and add them to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes have attributes and you plan their use, activate a dialog "day," when available, so that an entry in the action of the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I have decided to create a starter button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually noted, rigidly, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startled; -Day in the current document will insert.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with setting actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the apply button and continue using other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some conventional & quantaplus; functions to toolbar or it should set them to better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar setting via settings tool. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to add to toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, how the separators support the grouping. anyone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & Konqueror; -button the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be stored imroot folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar is loaded (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter explains how I create a & PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might consider in & quantaplus; Repository See if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you must look for an existing documentation for the formatique / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. first, we will leave you, the second we treat it here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configurations file [Tree] Doc dir = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = Section1 = Section1.html 2 = amended 1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1 = Section1.html 2 = sentence 2.html 2 = tag2html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = Section1.html 2 = 1,00 / html 2 = tag2.html 2 = tag3.html 2 = 1,00 /</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree is defined the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see it in the & PHP documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top item = PHP 4.2, PHP 4.2 documentation = Introduction = Introduction = Setttion.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synonom.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess lessons (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the index is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the Baumanure & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & quot; in all & XML; - based & quantaplus; resources cendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of docrc file, which is to be displayed on the layout of the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; Skriscript displays the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by flagging of the function and pressing by Ctrl; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the socket lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of covers separated context-elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are well and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as documentation used to use the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not become rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & torantaplus, are you not alone. it is possible to share the associated resources (DTEP packages, tooling with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send by email to friends, partners or else who are sent to. at various places there is an email to send menu application, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates, and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users will be able to download them. the contributions are checked and only available for publication. in order to sign a user account, what there is a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys you may need to search out. in the dialogue New resource requires the input fields. (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking on OK the uploading begins.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD package, toolbar toolbar, and in the context menu files and folders in the templates and scripts tree can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and the signature. in case of problems there may be broken. if the integrity are given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not yet produced by & quantaplus; but it can be time-consuming, as hundreds of tag files can be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and Converting of DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. afterwards the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target section: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string, which in the! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http / / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd shall appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Tuning the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; after the transformation the & descriptionrc; -editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and do the full benefit of & quantaplus, you must first get acquainted with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to give them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; also available. by tooling on actions, everything is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; saved. this allows the group of administrators to secure tooling, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to anyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development remedies for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that it can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to tool making use of special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project, making the common usage of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some major areas: the editing window, the builder, the carteies with info and the toolbar. please hit in, and for further information on these sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the Carpathians with the right mouse button to remove a context menu with the current documentation et passable orders, such as close the current, other or all carnation, recharge, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editing field, leading to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic usage steps (cut / copy / paste), processing of the mouse-cursor, using the word under the mouse-cursor, or Open the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editors, the Editors are currently participating, and HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default to which a set of toolbar will be shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tooling is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, for example & lt; then click on the icon which represents the day. now, you can insert the data for that just added tag. if you want to insert the data for this straight tag. if you want to insert it a day that has several attributes, you can fill in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information on & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and wander. in the presentation with carteies stand for files, project, pattern, documentation, scripts, attributes, and documentation components.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows the steward of files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions such as add, removal, uploading or deleting the files from memory medium can be performed using the click menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the respective users and assists in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information on a script. on the right mouse button you can start further functions, such as the script to edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking of the element it will set the cursor in the document to the position of the element. through the right-clicking of an element it opens up a list of commands regarding navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other sub-views. with it can change manfast attributes and namespaces. this refers to the content of the disposable income system, allows modification of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project it can projecated, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & Quantaplus, two Karteies at the bottom of the window, can be reached through the usable information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carillon shows information about each in the Quanta running script. so, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardium marks all the faults in the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tooling are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Chocolate eite of the toolbar is the possibility to define own orders as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with enamel. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an e-mail, they can save them in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; for this, autoconf file a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to provide a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help one. the options are simple to understand and not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems at the start of & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 am folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& equantaplus; is a web-development tool for the KDE-surface. & Quantaplus; has been optimized for a rapid Web-development and combines a matured development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the endeavor to create the best & HTML; editor, began to employ the developers of & quantaplus; an independent, extendable markup language editor? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web-development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim needs to be arrested, that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. thanks to the & kde; -Scst is not only all of it possible, but allows users and developers, & torantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase the automation of almost every task. through the program of coma, they can now expand & equantaplus; (more about it can be found in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detail documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quanta perform).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffectively sequite @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list is changing every time you open a file, which is not located, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section about templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project executive, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting the clipboard there are special characters to the HTML; check-up, so that they appear correctly and are not understood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; check-up, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a row number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; - script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regulary expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window to or not. that's the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"" "" "" "initial and turning of the problem porters at the bottom of the" "" "quantaplus, master" "". "the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structurce." ""</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolspold left from the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Introduces a dialog to paste files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched for the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows e.g. graphics files to your project folder or subfolders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Download the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; depending on whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in Chapter & Quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project toolbar. these are stored in the project / toolbar and are only available in this menu if you have allocated it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up by settings actions... to be added. Toolbox are stored about toolbar toolbar or you will be asked when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this deletes them from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; team, that the toolbar in the next release is available). the menu item opens a new e-mail message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbar to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD;, you or anyone else made others and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities out of the & DTD;. is sensible, if the entities out of the & DTEP are to renew, without the whole & DTEP; to renew. if this global is and a write permission in the global KDE folder does not exist, it fails to load.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags available in the currently available toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there are in the tags menu a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags and actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; deny the insertion by toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the above-mentioned menu points. click on it. click a activated plug-ins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntaxonomic mode for the current file. the list of available exercises schemata depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of pointer identification. very useful if you know people using the other OS platforms for development. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using selected & DTD; with external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate conversion between different ways of user interface. through some limitations in the KDE libraries, the Shift mode can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the carr card mode, which is also default, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu features an entry for each open subwindow. with selection of one entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">The display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behaviour of the editor. in the documentation of & Kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you can delete entries from the toolbar or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse-cursor, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled best from top to below, since e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine, to which you want to access, except your local data. either a name (hostname.unparalleled .de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. when a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. when a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webinations you want to download and change. in server-based script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Skip, if files, which are somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be included. if a project is started anew, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are shown within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of fertilizers.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by clicking, or, by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that will simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the menace window, or using the shortcut Shift. F7 are changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcard possible), which can be reformed in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to top, also files which are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project overview, which is loaded when opening the project. in addition, more than projections can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This enables the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be adjusted with the button options. in, the debugger is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload profiles can upload high-profile profiles (see in) as well as the display of a blueprint for the content of the server for each profile, showing a separate builder for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as delete a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, one can turn on event actions and add these actions, change or delete. event actions will be executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as the sipping of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & Quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior cannot be influenced at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, choose project open... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave likewise, but the entries are open and opening with... in the right button of the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the upsurge files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more a profile is available, the button will expire to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will retain in the core memory and forget at Programmer. this possibility is useful when common uploading files is needed and the more unsafe password to save on the disk does not get into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-ladeprofiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) will be uploaded onto different servers. when editing or creating a profile will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slave. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator operates a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the plate so that it can not be easily read, but everyone can easily see in plain text text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tooling. it can be used in a project many views, that is, through simple exchange of view, multiple files and toolbar can be loaded and replaced the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu or the project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar Project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbar in & quantaplus; best to use the menu toolbar. use and Add-adding will differ below in the section of adding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and icons can be set either using the context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New action, a New toolbar can be set, which results in the dialog, where can be specified, which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context-text to an action (icon) on a toolbar, in addition to remove the entries, remove the action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can set up their settings in the menu with settings tool... and setting up actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeleton, code snip and files for linkages. & quantaplus; uses basically like a nasty filesystem with extensible organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or any system existing directory in the plorable tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in some of the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template's conditions before using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not purer text. it can be added any file except text, i.e. pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binaries. binary templates are usually available in documents by shortcuts (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). further information about the templates, is available in documents.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple affolding for the purpose and organises work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the process-making tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final note up to a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are included in the process-making tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, in a zipped tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure to Believer (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file As a template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has been done, you notice that (even if it has been stored as a project pad) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the process-making tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on File As a template store selection as a local / student template. alternatively, the selection can be removed with pulling and drains on the manoeuvre templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a subfolder folder. all file management functions are used, such as pulling and Ablegen or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the project file sub-view onto a folder to the right and backup it. by default, the project folder is assured, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented procedure. you can insert headlines and footer or dynamically with & PHP; create, paste files or link with them. additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files presented in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / quanta / templates / apps / templates /</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder in the template with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select the right-click menu. the following dialogue will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is canceled as soon as Elteral attributes have been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the regulators in the preliminary view. if a root folder would be adjusted in principle, unless they would appear explicitly. in the case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building. if nothing appears, you probably find themselves in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed or set-up text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of ingredients to equip a folder with special headlines / footer lines a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (pointing right mouse button) via a complete commanding collection for adding folders or copy, and insert them from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; the Editor and VPL; the first mode replaces the source text editor with the VPL; editor and the second mode is sharing the Editorwindow into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: he invites a document like a regular & HTML; - or & XHTML; then you can edit and switch back to the source editor, in which the changes carried out in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor to a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit or edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes are enabled both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor will sync this mode, then mode of pressing the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The Synchronization Editor between the VPL; -Editor and the source text editor allows you to select between synchronisation after a click or automatically. when selecting automatic can be adjusted in addition to the time period. basically, the recommendation applies: a small spaniel for fast computer and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, then you want to select the title of the website, so the processing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; -editor will also be called once a new document with the VPL; editor will also be created. that's the reduction of the suspension code. that's how you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow the storage of information about the document yourself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows modification of content, e.g. keywords in column name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules using the buttons below the list or delete. a change over the list is possible just as with the Meta elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template, pressing to the file-open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is possible, as in a text processing, due to the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor is as usual. text can be inserted as usual. text can be introduced by typing or removal-button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is made in the same way over the tooling Editor, as in the source text editor, not removed. it is to note that inserting tags at previously already existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor tag, is inserted by text, every other the surrounding anchor has to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tooling like the tables Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they are later called in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbar must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examination of style templates. in contrast to other programs for styling, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can browse with the arrow buttons on / off by the use of the previously made commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Multiple commands may require more than one argument. quotes may be used to set up compound words as an argument. & eg.: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument, a holder in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>
<seg id="2276">Template _ NAME: a valid name of a template, which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x00 to 0x7F. this name can be a fully Qualified name as "XSL: templateName".</seg>
<seg id="2277">Filename: a valid local file name on the user of the user. at Unixes or Cygwin systems the name may have the prefix "~" as short form for the personal folder. on RISC-OS systems are also additional environmental variables.</seg>
<seg id="2278">Path: a path to the changes of the workstation. on several operating systems the prefix "~" will be replaced by the path to your personal folder.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are lots of graphical tools for comparisons. why & kv3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contribution had been made and corrected at many places the regression had been corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what changed exactly within these lines. and there was no references to the places where perhaps only the rearrangement had changed. this change was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kv3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way connections will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons are working independently of each other at a piece of code and make changes. the co-guide editor allows you to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected. in this Editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files to assemble</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you also with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kv3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of current color monitors. if you have to check code frequently, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are shown visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no hassle more, if someone changes the reverse.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is identical, and the other differs in a row, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make yourself the tipping work easier by simply writing the filenames of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folding 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 CHner3 Folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows filentype file name, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting an recently opened file from the list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences will be carried out with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders is introduced, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kv3; the filenames from A to the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set the output file immediately. you can do this step later on saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start with the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active TV window. the comparison starts then immediately. in open dialog, you will need to select no files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and drains: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor and let it fall over a comparator window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you have to load only two relevant files, it in & kdiff3; upload and then compare. now you can copy the relevant sections easily, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: right now you can pull nothing out & kv3; pull out. only the case of text in a similar window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and drains of text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such cases, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each word window is the info line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional), let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color, which file is different. (color for conflicts in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left beside the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, there are white characters only in strings and comments, relevant to the processor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the contraction column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the pointer is checked, the line is dotted along the broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the compares windows) also has an info-line with the inscription output: the filenames and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains the automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are disbanded, the store is disabled!!! (use the buttons Ringe to a higher resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the colour background color for current area and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or by manual leaves no further line left in the group; then there is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind, and perhaps again select another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker you may perhaps copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; containment conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go cautiously with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are dealt with as well as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating mainly with the screen runs and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. when you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow buttons, right, beginning, end, string, beginning and strands, siw like you can also use it from other programs. the crossing column besides the vertical box can also be used to use the Navian.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In augmentation window you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the inserting button you can switch between insertion and transfer mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the squeezing columns synced the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as stated in the section and the editable window have been declared).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-bottom / trunk up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Away) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you must copy the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is, whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying. be careful with this option but be careful because you could dismiss the content of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Poets are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline sign\, and Win32-based systems use auto-run\\ r\. KHAN3 keeps the drawing of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binaries files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start. (Menu Insteller- &gt; Kail3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog presents also writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in recursive script. if the chosen writing is not supported, it does not happen at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be astert. on these systems the button presets automatically displays an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, when pressing the Tabulator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise a tablator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entry or return, the preceding line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection automatically copies into the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard then falls off.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which pointer type you prefer to save. the set value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same time, try Cdiff3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. in this step white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a wagon sign '\' and a newline '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car turns out, but then you may be treated with different sizes on the side-side comparison, however, like a white character. during which collapse this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, figures and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are dealt with as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intense still look for smaller differences. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and big files, but slowly at very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatic-routing mode determines this attitude, as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict is injected.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters in white characters. (default choice.) That's useful when white characters in many files are less important. please note that the automatic selection also deals in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter for scanning from folders and diarrhea. check for details on documentation for the directory-comparison and direction.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is appended the Suffix .orig. if there is already such a backpack file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting to the interface of the user interface. changing this option affects not the currently running program. you need to finish and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you have enabled this option, for all entries the upper adjustment is used.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding appears a brief indication of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpretations. since the coding is individually adjusted for each file, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed an file, you can specify which coding should be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they could possibly not work with your codec. (e.g., your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can handle only with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can determine the code from the output editing command.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress announcements of changes in white characters into the text or survivor. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in the normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, you might want to check only the differences between two of three files. according to selection from A & lt; B, A & B; C, A & B; C, C or B & lt; C, C is displayed in addition to the normal still a second crossing column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. blending up the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Configure the other window next to each other or another. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click will automatically start the assembling and use the filenames of the last source file as a pre-set name for output file. (if this function is used to restart it, the name of the last used file will be used.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will pass on to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function for example, to cut disruptive parts or correct the reuse.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is passed first to this external command, then the output of the command is given to the input command. the output of the command is only used in the line command processor. you can write your own processor command, which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each entry line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the slide results. but for this, an external application requires, and most users do not want to program yourself. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl totally inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command to convert into Upletters' s /\\ U\\ '/\\ U\\'. *\\\\\ '.\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first Klammernfew.\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to automatically add strings (info: / cvs / Keyword _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _ _\ _ BAR _ _ _ _ _</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you might like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in Kdiff3. sed it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for newline matches. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Each sign between '[' and '] is a hit, and every hits is replaced by nothing, so practically erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several options at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed sed you can also use something else like e.g. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allergy. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the moving '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and to merge. further operations only change the data that the pointer is identical to algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... it can simulate the simulated changes, and displays the simulated changes without it really perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 button), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the same and merge of single files very similar. you just need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, Folner1 is used as basis. if no target folder has been specified, Udiff3; Ordin3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison from folders automatically starts, do not start it up. to run it, you must select the corresponding menu button, or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the entry of the folder you will find a little news window on the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is completed, & kv3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that was found during the scan, is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can double-click on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object or use the arrow buttons for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories, and list all subdirectories with which you can capture all folders and / or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you want to double click on a file, the file will be started and it will be a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the covert action cannot be automatically elected. if that will bring together, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the image above, columns A / B / C are used in red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, in identical contracts, the colour is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow is and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not a: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same disk type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same disk type (e.g. if A folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronization is active, if only two folder and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option is sync, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but do not exist: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after that, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and selecting the new file (unsure) option, then analyzed & kdiff3. if the files are different, but the same date then appears. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange does not eliminate such errors, this folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While connecting a file after another one. you status column shows Fertig, when it collapsed, and according to other reports, if something unexpected has been completed, you should make a final review and see if the status is all right everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When the file dialog box is selected full-term analysis, Kdecker 3 further columns will display. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can merge with either the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all covert actions (also in all subfolders), you can merge it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then in three-folder mode C, C as the goal is used to merge with two-folder files, B as target and used for synchronization A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options to be skipped through the particular entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring all entries together: select directory form / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to run only the current item, select the action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If by contradictory data types still invalid actions exist, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the options running, simulate and abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulation if you only want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then guides certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a composite window opens up (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select once again or press F7. if you have not saved yet, an appropriate dialogue will appear. then & kv3 continues its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; clicking on a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will find some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with it.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually assembled, you notice & kv3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them at the later stage of all entries. even if this has collapsed later or not saved, these entries will change as settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings-menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Kail3 set up...) now has a section called directory-merger with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element row. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid space holder: '*' and '?'. (eg * * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. folders do not have to comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element row; use the semicolon; as separators. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders conform to this pattern are not displayed in the element row; use the semicolon; as separators. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autoptionally generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be adjusted specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems files have a default file. in other filesystem a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in the default configuration.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic linkups are compared. if the option is switched on, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folder and recursively searches. a link to a folder that contains a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and & kdiff3; this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file by demonstrating the statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare big folder via a slow network, it's possibly faster, just the changesic date and the file size to compare. however, this speed is cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the chancellor. there is no real comparison instead of. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. for example, it can be useful for example when copying the amendment date. please use caution. this option is in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enabled the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder. in this mode, the suggestions for merge files will be identical. also, the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is regarded as uncertain as it is provided that the other file has not been changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version is renamed with the .orig enhancement already exists, this will also affect the normal composite files, not only the composite folder. this option is enabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the stewards view stays visible to the single files visible; you can switch the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the window directory & text window to switch to the window in the window menu and switching between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file easily using double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu item. you can merge the function Current file from the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be completed and the file will not be merged once you merge the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost however once you read the directory again: directory menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KHAN3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can open files and folders for opening up on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a zipped archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, empty sheet &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder displays. then, always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit credentials or modification of change. therefore, the permissions or the change date from the original. (note the option confidential for the size.) (This is only possible on local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently used as differences in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences. to boot Kail3, press the right mouse button of the differences in the viewer and then select In Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kv3; two complete input files. if it is applied as a part, the input file is a patch file in the Unified format. then it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kail3Part. additionally, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; run as part, it only supports the equivalent of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that will merge or the equivalent of folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDe2 (now Heis it compare) there are already. besides, the name Kail3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the slide-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or go for it.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be notified to the correct prefix. in the default, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can not find resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs vary, these lines will be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is treated differently, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines are coming to each other, this is, but this is the case of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information goes without clicking into the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is simply being saved as text file and it is too much effort to create extra a file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort of this was so far too big. you can restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src lints; published and the text does not delete it. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to make out of difference. even more reduction would be confusing and misses the purpose. use this for an other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">You can find information on how to use Kag 3 on other platforms without KDE.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kv3; compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system in which KDE installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems at compiling. should nevertheless occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Umschalt-Delete) copies into the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or envelope inserting) adds the text from the clipboard to the current curposition or replacing the current marking system.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences display: files that appear in all folders appear not in the folder structure, and consequently also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder after changes to these options to Refresh the folder.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries displayed to show the differences. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing in a later program version. (the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version.) This option is switched off in the default file.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the marking A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of buttons, the lines from the corresponding window attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available), they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default, this option is deactivated. underdifferences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a mini-show of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspace, change their size, to finish it or move it. this works both inside a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual space surfaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows within & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on an empty background of & kpager, the context menu has only two entries to set up... and ending. however, if applied to an application within & kpager; if there is also a symbol and the name of the application, as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, on workspace and ending. the orders make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when applied to an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">Is this tightrofield marked, can be windows inside the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, at & kpager; the names of the virtual work surfaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross the field of the field lets the & kpager; the numbers of virtual work surfaces display. if it is displayed together with name, the names will be attached with folder, & eg; 1st workspace.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the & kpager; indicated.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is ticked, the running programs are displayed as small window in & kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to make their selection possible.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its default icon and pixel. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; the main thread; classic leaves & kpager, as well known as out of Pager applications in some other Windowls; wavering shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row and vertical in a vertical series, which is very good for pointing side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager minibus program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be altered in size, display the windows as symbols or with their content. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click on the right mouse button within & kpager; and subsequent suspension of switches... lets the dialog settings seem.</seg>

<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can cope with the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse. unfortunately, you may also be caused by the simple reason caused by the mouse. unfortunately, you suffer from pain that are related to your computer if this is not yet to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps in clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the mouse due to the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic agents, the result may be different for each of them.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse-click as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shifting is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause, after leaving the mouse button. now move the mouse button. in this way, you can run the pulling with pressing mouse button. the smart shifting requires a little practice, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This period has to be petrified after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smartly switched on, the screenfield is enabled (1 / 10 s) actively. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shutdown the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse-button again, if there is timed no problem due to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the clicks by mouse-shift. this function creates a slow way of left and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. this motions are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can be able to shorten the reaction time. go to sound & Multimedia, select the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider Sound buffer, which you adjust to a lower value in order to shorten the responses.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this attitude is marked, & kmousetool; starting at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; please click GNOME or other window frames, please check the particular documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back to the values that have been adjusted when opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button down, the settings will apply to the state after the last push.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially using the preference. in particular, the smart shifting should you first be turned off. if you then click on the automatic click, you can later switch the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to decrease the answers of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse-click on without effect remains: the clicks on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not link to unseasoned reactions. you can park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse rests, you should clean your mouse. that's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you clean not just the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you must pick out the mouse ball. how this happens, is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would need to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the bullet was used. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt road easily with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if this is just a deportedly started. if you're in this case the intelligent moving tool, this means that & kmousetool; the operation is no longer able to end the button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use one window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform even a mouse click. here, the status of & kmousetool is reset, and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, tries & kmousetool; continue to follow mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. however, you don't park the mouse on a neutral field of work surface, if you are a keystrophy. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart media, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart shifting is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you start to copy it into the clipboard, copy it into the clipboard and carry out any other action in which you want to move the mouse while pressing the mouse button. but there will probably be some advice.</seg>
<seg id="2522">If you do not use the smart shift if you just begin using & kmousetool; follow text instead as follows: run the Shift key, while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and there again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. thus each time is pressing a sound like a mouse click. thus, you know exactly when when smart relocating the moving time. later you can use the smart shifting without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and it is furnished correctly.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional filter filter. at the first start of & ktts, it is automatically set up as a propositional filter filter. you can add its settings or add another satellite filter.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the arrangement of the spokesman by taste. place the Speak selection orders, which speaker & ktts. switch off the spokesman orders, change some characteristics and check how the choice of the speaker is changing. you have to have of course more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then, faster with the pre-reading may start, as only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You may stop or cancel text messages on the map, even if the voice synthesizers does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal satellite veins filter is automatically set up when you start kttsms for the first time. it can not be switched off, just removed, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Satzboreholding filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabulator (tabular code 8) to the typing border (table characters) in front of the filtering automatically removed from the text). note that the standard Satzsor filter can be included in the string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied at & kde; messages (cold), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed an account of the normal satellite veins filter, you can insert it again by loading the _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map speaker, you can write the speaker settings for the application. the carteicard is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard loudspeaker (the top on the diamond tab). in other words: no speaker properties are fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the passable microphone, which shows all the characteristics of a standard microphone. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom; if you choose the settings of the speaker. otherwise select & ktts, the speaker, which corresponds to the original properties originally intended.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Mark this ancrux if the property should take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, this is always treated as a priority property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language, lies before, if you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than the one described in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field of speaker, which is best suited to the following, click the selection button to use standard speakers and then use the spokesperson who corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 stands for the last word contract in queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number is required 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsms immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug-support, but I do not get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; probably you need to register Gstreamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x is the command GST-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of Gstreamer is installed. you can try to upgrade or install Gstreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; enabling the management of network interfaces, routine and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop devices via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; enabling the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical equipment and their drivers must already be functional and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices at installing & Linux; are installed and set up. network devices will be added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the core version,</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded when the network settings is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; index selected. when starting the module settings, this system tries to detect the platform at the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list to select the distribution and release version. by flagging the setting non-again queries, the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means settings can only be considered. in the system administration mode, you arrive by clicking the button-administration mode at the lower bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available networks are displayed. on the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced settings shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By choosing Automatically the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP information is required for each system start, so no further adjustment can be required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, you can set the TCP / IP configuration without your HCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field network mask is the subnet mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this attitude is marked, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialisation is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not already be used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console; you can determine if the requested address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched on, depending on the need. turn off a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled depending on the need. switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the machine in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If on the computer there is more than one network interface, the interface must be selected, in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine http: / / www.einedomain.org, the DNS replaces this name into an IP address, such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine to namespa part of the rider namespace allows for easy handling of this list. entries can be added, removed, or altered wer.DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a setup and execution or demotion in the list with the buttons or herunder in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, needs to be set in a & Console; the following command must be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source text.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply the rpm package to download and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphically surface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult, to compile it. however, the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology will be given, in the second, all are discussed by & knetworkconf; Change Configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace more detailed knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of PCs is given into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great spread. by IPv6, it is expected in the near future. this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP address is to assign a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the contact person, which is a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a dedicated small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the internet, so their any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called Standard Route, the Zweite the loopback-address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP-redirecting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part the configuration files which are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changing with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connection there is another content defined there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a hedging program for band drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to build multiple archives on a tape. the first goal was to provide a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpack. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be integrated by & kdat; this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat: reult the band and reads the preload of the banana. detects & kdat; the prox on the tape is not, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the preference, it is searching for the appropriate index on your record. can this not be found, you'll be asked if the bandindex is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol is changing for the band's work to indicate that the tape was incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the banana can now be searched through out of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the bonds, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; if there is a change in the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a message in the status bar. the tape can now be discarded without any danger.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can direct the Restore, the files that are to be restored, can be checked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives files that belong to the tape. it is restored only the selected file or the subfolder.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the banded file by the bandleader. this process solves all existing index files for this band. you can restart the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should be done. the list of the deleted files is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, that only the files stored in the file system are stored on the same file system, as the folder. folder, which are on other filesystem, you can register separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used since the last incremental file. it only saved the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snappy file in front of the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons is incts, and lt; lt; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for the belt drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-reention version of the band-device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is included, the load is carried out to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & kdat; to lock the trigger in the bandhead. possibly this attitude does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the type of integration of & kdat is thrown out. use this option not in floppy-Streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, the hardware is enabled, tries & kdat; not all drives support variable score sizes. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you must communicate & kdat; in any case, the block size for your band drive will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat: a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file will be composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The Band-ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, where billing is the complete name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat files.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can manage directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a B; observer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where to get information about your system or where the system permits the different protocol files. furthermore, users can access quick access to information about problems that appear on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your machine does in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system is stored on the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can access quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. thus, some advanced functions will provide, with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, puts & ksystemlog; functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; initially the most important protocol file of the system - the system Protocol - will not be displayed, and it will probably not open up with system managers. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user normally no justification for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filtering bar to filter for selected filter lines. the list of the log lines will now be automatically altered, so that only logs in the filter box will be displayed automatically. in the default setting, the drop-line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select a different entry at this point. select the string of the filter protocol, for example, in the filter file system protocol, and enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent to you which have been sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level failure are displayed with a showcasing color as protocol lines of level reference. the colored representation of protocol lines may be switched with setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can use the process identification (PID) in the column process. for example, it can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific instruction, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can skip the option to jump new lines in the context menu of the main window, to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindow. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol on display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dating you will find more current information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) As & ksysv;. this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system rapidly develops to the standard for controlling the program starts in the & Linux operating system. and therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go on historical aspects here (e.g. because I know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binar file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you will need to make sure the old insit was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init is also different from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you like to start the system or switching to another Runlevel. system services involve such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services involve not such things like settes, which will only be started. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also do a rc.on in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something out of what has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel entered / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the set-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can reconfigure / etc / inittab. if you have a bit together, then you come to repair the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start with all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, you will probably see something like:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stops init actually system services? very easy: each of the scripts is written, that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start using these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes a C, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could make & eg; an server running level, which only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc., moreover, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or any other pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of Available System services on one of the six Runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between Runleveln or shift the position within a level by turning it somewhere else. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of Available systems services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new zone. to simply select it from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter into the target area, even if the same entry has previously existed in the target zone.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no possibility of recreate entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available System services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons, to make a selection of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button key to change the properties tab. use the tabular button to change between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or push Esc to throw the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are removed from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise it will be restored by & ksysv; modifications to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single use mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and changing the standard Runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for the execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way the system services launched in these distributions, simplify the configuration for the proprietary layout programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel, so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you made changes, you must save it. either use the appropriate icon of toolbar or entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is an easy application. the main window consists of two carr cards, the user interface and the user group list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it will appear in the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some carr cards are displayed only if you have enabled extended system settings (Quota) for users, if you are able to perform extended system settings on which you can make individual settings. other carr cards appear, in case Shadow-passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Carpacard Password management appears if Shadow-passwords are installed or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This mapping card appears only if available for at least a single filesystem tree (Quota) and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can modify parameters for each user, while the limited restrictions are limited in KB.</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space constraint</seg>
<seg id="2997">The carteicard groups informs about the group irregularities of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field primary group. furthermore, users can become a member in other groups by highlight them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add out of the menu user or group or click on the matching button button in the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group is analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, remove the boot-password, remove and modify the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, modify, modify and add more.</seg>
