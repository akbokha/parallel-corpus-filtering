although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinary .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American films , danced to American music , American authors read and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mostly journalist due to an American film .
as the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ let &apos;s letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ magn@@ ates with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who was the Supreme Court with judges who were interested to occupy his interests .
I was caught .
free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; me it was , as if the absolute truth is , iss everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you are always the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very warm greeting letter about his size .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much was written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me , how he conver@@ ts with his bot@@ toms up .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , expressed it , and declares publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number one had ever achieved by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ gie person , I asked myself ?
I was able to tie in Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
such as my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a profound person , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view is not associated with Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy B@@ ahr who lives for the environment long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me much in my career .
these people and those through them em@@ body values deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tru@@ mp have paved its way to nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential elections , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tru@@ mp because they either share his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke my heart almost .
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tru@@ mp @-@ voters as a se@@ gregation .
to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which most of them are , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ k@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ no@@ m . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word from white in playful on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ id@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as called the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is welcome .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , is nowhere else in the world .
but with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise of this promise , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole notion of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who like in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud , No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ck the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos got a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answer they .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find place in this new America .
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 mi@@ leage south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for several years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) is now played by children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra , which has been a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the village of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and bank violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth so offered a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band@@ members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , means the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come up and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically located on the biggest garbage dump of As@@ un@@ cion in Paraguay , capital - on instruments that are manufactured from re@@ plac@@ able waste material :
music with reproduced instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycled he began using F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the case into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local oil ologist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning time :
first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something which he had never seen before : an made up of waste .
today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from reconstructed material and called The Modern Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance on :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing battles .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published in En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs under an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already been operated in purple waters from illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa looked .
the East African countries were thus brought up accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legislative break@@ water of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they linger to him , one of their ports and refused to give him a fisher@@ man &apos;s violin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch some fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the pl@@ undering of fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crosses and resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale fishing ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; so we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts &apos; En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is by definition un@@ regulated : what is captured is hidden , absent because of it is extremely difficult to trace . so the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
through the inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing was once passed through bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snail speed , with the information between individual countries , so the actions happen in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries with each other can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships even very attentive when they move on the open sea , with satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the botanical areas . also , so susp@@ ects travel routes - about those who suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships .
ideally , such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal spirits .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to pay for numbers as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then a considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the platform that has been created was created to win 20 million USD in lost sales , including the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . under these same illegal fishermen .
among these practices , such practices include operations like the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit license papers , indicating of fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ destructive control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship could not fish and one country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you dar@@ ling my harbour not &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale slip hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inception , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in over 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
there has uncovered criminal networks , who had fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has per@@ secuted and found wings .
based on its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into networking crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that is supposed to help the F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise .
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed , will also help to open the illegal ships that hide themselves .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and this we try to cross through , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fisheries data and provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ technical support .
some of the ships are now turning their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be ordered from satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it is supposed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and means that the position of each individual trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - this simply gives sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite themselves and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals , but they are also terri@@ fy .
ships that have formerly been exploited without a license and barely reck@@ on with consequences , now they know they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board ship networks whose use is prohibited .
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries simply copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa each year , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , 2015 six countries have joined forces , to the so called West Africa Task Force . they now fight against illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the target to allow even more such initiatives and structures to come into other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member of Somalia could report his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used tu@@ pp@@ nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking action against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they tackle illegal fishing events , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proving that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the ministers of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

since the Government had rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on ministers , the Venezuel@@ ans responded in their eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in the void of the country .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the rep@@ ay@@ ment of Venezuela ) can be found both by these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ eastern Bundestag Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita im State State Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is deterior@@ ating constantly , which is notic@@ ing in the everyday life of the Venezuel@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition have seen in the counter@@ part of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; however , in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting in Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government &apos;s role as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence is among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and wider lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to conquer the country to regain its institutional structures and close a new government alliance .
the electoral bloc of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) , called to join the opposition to the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Miraflores palace , the Venezuel@@ an government headquarters , on 3 November planned , should continue the block@@ ade of the referendum on counter@@ recovery .
the call was commented on Twitter among others as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide strike strike and on 3 November each to Caracas to the Miraflores palace .

the first demonstration during the Programme of Action , &quot; The Re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .

on Twitter skins images that tell about conflicts as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the central @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and the armed support of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including that woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira wear no tubes , because you could see something otherwise , what many nation@@ alists do not have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already an info@@ graphic that forms the scale of oppression per day :
thus , the dictatorship have sup@@ pressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim for a counter@@ part proceedings - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many innumerable people on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado pretend that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your ministers !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government who has taken little against the devastating economic crisis in their point of view and rather busy themselves with critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches take more and more an incidence and intensity .
some Venezuel@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to take part in a strike , rather than to work or to go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city of CÃ³rdoba .
as meanwhile adult men said Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father .
in the trial that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at BÃ¼r@@ de , to carry the same name as his father , to the brutal military events in the prison of La Per@@ la , he had suffered enough at the age of 15 .
for 34 years he held the family secret to himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years one re@@ alizes that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realize at that time , that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father of 1976 was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who was before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there , I was wounded with a boy who made combat sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an Ar@@ sh@@ ole , you made you friends with one of the ERP .
pass just on that they will not take you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito colon@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - revolution@@ ists People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for that way my Father had brought me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - all possible - stood .
everything of that was stolen .
he gave me a small piece of wick@@ edness and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
this day I went to the other end of the bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen items were deduc@@ ted and kept me with an out@@ post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wn out and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on the human being .
it looked like a double bed and metal fe@@ ather .
later I found out that it was attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
she rarely captiv@@ ates a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ poured him with water and put him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was in it ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I wondered : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and kn@@ itted .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people were captiv@@ ated with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people stood still in the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ile thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I called &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me down ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man together and killed .
( according to the survivors of the civil war ) Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , to put the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio crosses , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here , their names were changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that it should be laid .
this was the lie - of eu@@ phem@@ ism - for the liberation of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War of war &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things to home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war mare &quot; - as she called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ mare has a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs , which one takes an enemy which one has fought .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is rob@@ bery .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this vag@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer in gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a criminal , and I said , and thou that thou hast made cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded to anger , sm@@ ote me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
for this we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I turned out in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I carried a jacket and a sco@@ oter pul@@ lover from wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with it .
back then , the defense of a co @-@ conspir@@ e had been accused of this crime . I disagree , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ The scr@@ am@@ end of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I think repent@@ ance .
I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops and acknow@@ le@@ dges that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ ec@@ u@@ ated during the dictatorship . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children do deto@@ xi@@ fy ?
one day my father brought a girl home with his mother .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put it into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not even families to pass on their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the scr@@ am@@ end of the cor@@ pse is the last h@@ ein@@ ous act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced , they hol@@ den machinery to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were gr@@ ind and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course still remains .
&apos;@@ i saw how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
the thought to view my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know not . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt st@@ agn@@ ant and asked me what the whole exaggerated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , actually were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I called :
how can you tell us something ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you forced me to participate as a child to participate .
he only contradic@@ ted &quot; Na then Me . &quot;
exactly what I did .
in 2010 I released the first ad .
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can imagine that I have been taken . I finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : under heavy , non @-@ lawful freedom of imprisonment in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year child .

the jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1978 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty on crimes against humanity . the court sl@@ ated in 28 cases for life @-@ long adhesi@@ on , and in nine cases sti@@ pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was acqu@@ itt@@ al .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gement : murder , torture and rape by ministers . # Es@@ war@@ heads of Govern@@ ors
all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military members , former police members and civil society .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court section is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working towards justice for the victims for years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 @-@ founded Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ S. who killed the children of people who were killed or disappeared during the dictatorship :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government gave the land on which La Per@@ la was , so that a memorial could be built , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese City of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving licence , in the last month , witnesses of a very special failed translation .
on a sign the Japanese word on the site that was on the site ( coron@@ ation sha ) , the &quot; older car &quot; means , fal@@ si@@ fied - perhaps even with BÃ¶@@ ll @-@ wit@@ ge@@ ous &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; translated as a fri@@ ghtful motor@@ ist .
the false translation was published from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the error was Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made aware of the local tim@@ ings .
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced with the proper term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ fecture Kyoto apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore she stated that the error was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely feel that older people were offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat down somewhat on the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of the tur@@ ers . according to the police there is the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in the country , but quite some cause for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 . this represents a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
in this way , its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of those caused by the elderly has risen in the same period .
the name of the name did not bring comments to light on Yahoo announced version of the article comments to the light that show what pre@@ concep@@ tions some Japanese people seem to fight against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via the translation error was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; about the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widely used in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true fund@@ ament for this bizarre errors in English .
photo from Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ place you need two important skills : passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language . in general , conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - native language .
this should be a French native language for example from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as their native tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for the over@@ l@@ ation , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers , the Japanese language .
some companies that have no foreign employees , make translations nevertheless fir@@ ing internally . then , the Japanese people , whose English skills are considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
original translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that are created by mechanical translations show that this technique may not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling printing prints , which often uses t @-@ shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to read or do not understand them .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation error may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless . however , by major companies or from the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the Internet and television take
the main page of the portal as Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezuel@@ an internet user , they had no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet access from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV will no longer be accessible .
also other online broadcast@@ ers transferred recordings to Caracas , organized by op@@ position@@ ists , who res@@ isted Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s government .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court was dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author with Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was folded and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an Provider was once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ zol@@ ers with Internet access , especially in times of turmoil .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant with reporting protests for 2014 . at that time , the Commission was threatened for tele@@ com@@ s with money la@@ undering and lock@@ ings , if they would continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as an &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I have signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ outs .
to be amazing that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ res of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online radio stations . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly carries its meetings .
previous post@@ ings of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet service providers now use DNS users . this is a technique , by which the DNS server will respond to specific domains .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request for such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ outs
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third blocked channel , the transfer was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flores , who was carried live in Caracas by the protests in Caracas .
Flores is beaten , while he was in police officers .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to broadcast .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : that way the Venezuel@@ ans of gaining access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting about current events in the country is always further complicated .
in Paraguay there are many girls to slave @-@ slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina Tina for the Rights of Children and collects from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by curator , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series called &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ uel@@ as , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lav@@ cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which she was not allowed together with the family who lived there .
just before her degree gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
that , from which something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one calls in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money , giving its inf@@ erior son or her under@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children must afford a lot of days of home@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all of that within the framework of a treaty which you cannot lift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these as Cri@@ a@@ az@@ go signed practice is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by major parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their study , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for some years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , researched and p@@ ran@@ ated .
she tried to call things on behalf , as the feeling of Gr@@ ati@@ tude , which is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , is generally silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double usion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in faith that they will complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; can &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with himself and justi@@ fies their exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance , which otherwise would not get education and maybe even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mist@@ re@@ ated , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never learn of it .
in January 2016 the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in hiding in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itÃ¤@@ ran@@ affiliated Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official in the residence .
Mar@@ Ã­n had lived in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres to the east of As@@ un@@ cion .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira l@@ acked up with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until it suffered le@@ thal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Gesellschaft of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go Society for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest leaders and demanded that there should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without pap@@ acy it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a strong examination of the fall .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their cri@@ adi@@ ta was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n will be trac@@ eable - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ ina , in which her father worked , she had to sign up and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all working and started to buy sweets on the street or on the market sweets for earning money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta into the capital As@@ un@@ cion .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to split the time so that you remained for learning too .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Friday for example pur@@ ged the fridge , p@@ addle the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but was also not un@@ bound@@ ed . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house@@ keeper as eating out of the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings of the house@@ holder of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , to stand with him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the rÃ©@@ g@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
he held her for intelligent , but did not stick with her . &quot; the house@@ holder had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; that &apos;s the fact that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ i , would speak to their native language Guaran@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that they had the education they had made possible to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she was totally clear that she got for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , bullying and the ra@@ ids , who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that anyone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly clear that I was not part of any group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the society pays the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group in which one can view advertisements for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city center in As@@ un@@ cion district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please register to you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the display got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment has been written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the fi@@ bers of the ad turned once again :
dear girl@@ friends , I have found one . I look , if it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .

in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a business system during the Spanish conquest , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were ens@@ la@@ ved in Paraguay and the official population of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers as semi @-@ slaves ) had to be dis@@ coura@@ ged , and the system of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers as semi @-@ slaves had to be examined ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers as semi @-@ slaves had to be examined ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers as semi @-@ slaves had to be examined ) and the system of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers as semi @-@ slaves had to be examined ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which workers of slavery had to fall into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social inequality in Paraguay and that to show power may be the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill writes Egyptian users in social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed to a bill on &quot; the regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , the user and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of the law a position would then be set up , which is in charge of providing citizens with a permission to provide social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register with their correct names and personnel numbers , to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could cause a sentence of up to six months in jail or a bill .
the bill , which consists of six parti@@ ality , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , who runs through the internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video voice and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose the user and users the registration . unclear is the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the legislative process , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and a password &apos; by the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook blocked .
that could mean Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall at a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to access information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not yet known that such plans do exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical concerning the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ological ( in German &quot; leading research organizations &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly oppose the technical capacities and the understanding of every authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology .
in my opinion , it feels like they can control the physical public and private rooms that could be done online .
if I take them seriously , then this means that they will be a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to conduct them to a court process .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at first in the legis@@ lature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful , or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of mind in the parliament , whose senses are maxim@@ ised and assured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliament@@ arians Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative pre@@ condition against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Tiersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ ner H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are reminded of protecting the Nig@@ erian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards caused by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard shows the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and the prosperity of ecosystems also depends on that a large predat@@ ory is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video therefore places that they have a shot of a big cat at the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ o , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , which not only consists of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it is also a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to creating protective zones for game @-@ animals in the Kurdistan region since 2013 .

in early March 2017 , the daily newspaper Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , made the progress made in the last six years to re@@ construct the life of those who were hit by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a Tsun@@ ami and a nuclear accident in Fukushima had spar@@ ked the disaster .
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a typical pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring War of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
even so , the pre@@ fecture of Fukushima lived a nuclear accident , already alone there were 160 000 inhabitants left their homes .
the special report by the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o show that the progress has been achieved in the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese reconstruction authority and survey results of those concerned itself .
housing construction in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Kah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitutes ( of the en@@ closure of the en@@ closure of the en@@ closure of the lie , seas@@ on@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be found Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent .
however , one still tries to settle six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated of homes for periods ( on the left , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emergency shel@@ ters . more than 75 per cent of evacu@@ ated in homes , were converted to final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures
like the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , their P@@ for@@ ten to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fisheries management in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again , only 30 percent of the fisheries management have resum@@ ed its operations in Fukushima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have drawn up in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land in large @-@ scale dom@@ ic@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear un@@ case , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares have been destroyed in the Fukushima &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered from tourism , but again , Fukushima remains quite beaten .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . in contrast , only 75 percent can be found here .
however , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to enjoy their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to establish a full picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacu@@ ation . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her indign@@ ant has changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper writes :
the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to get more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness of the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it comes to those that had to be evacu@@ ated from Fukushima pre@@ fecture
in her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the Kah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the position of evacu@@ ated from Fukushima .
Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , catastrop@@ hic , atomic incident , the Japan ever had to experience .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ation from Fukushima , nearly 63 million people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were killed back to Fukushima , in permanent spare parts .
after the end of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their homeland pre@@ fecture .
most of the evacu@@ ation areas are most of the evacu@@ ated areas who still arrive at Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ hausen , older than 50 years . they have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet other countries who speak a different language , the differences appear first to be larger than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one re@@ alizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about voice and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Cam@@ ar@@ asa talks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday , a police officer had taken him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a head@@ stock against the head . nationwide participated millions of demonstrators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s studied , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fr@@ actions .
doctors carried him on this Saturday and now have taken him into a artificial com@@ a .
its condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
in the pictures the face of the police officer is also identified with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the police officers in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until completion of the investigation of the incident of active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officer checked out by a prot@@ esters and in the intensive care centre , would be able to see his face six months on TV and the entire oppression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net in which one sees , like Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and a number of param@@ edic shortly to hurry to it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip @-@ clip one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus off the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ary re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and permit his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while being in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s in his memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s faces a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he was murdered the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the intensive school of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was at the intensive care centre after he has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has taken him with a po@@ ise .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal re@@ acts against demonstrators in the last Friday .
polic@@ emen rely on protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ stories and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ a .
the representative of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace People ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked the speaker to ren@@ oun@@ ce violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media protests supported by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically via a crus@@ hing glass window in order to create an illustr@@ ative image with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a title story with a c@@ anned bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a special cause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also has to recognise if one is strictly against any kind of damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are supported by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on Conc@@ eption with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ab@@ oration of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People &apos;s Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there is no noteworthy in sugar@@ s .
it is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane factories .
after the yields the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its facilities , until only the rum@@ our of steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be found new .
quite rarely the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veteran , which is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are in the east of the region of the type of sugar fabri@@ cation , which have been in use after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene reminds himself exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugar cane industry had already res@@ isted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , lack of administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 the production rose 1,@@ 6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest has not been any news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ be@@ et industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the church saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were im@@ portable to the country .
the initial idea was to focus on the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased again about a decade ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tons ) , the export export would be around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day certainly will go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people got their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he says as a soldier is known about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; scam . &quot;
nearly all respondents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place they formed a full @-@ time working group .
in front of the first closure of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially auth@@ ored documents covering only about the parts that would be removed to address the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister managed to approve any decision .
from there the responsibility was transferred and the letters were more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the we@@ ed factory two years and was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation of the sugar cane factories .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ demonstrated one of his 31 days of employment .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and more important desktop producers has been er@@ ased .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for jobs and services that generated plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech from 21 October 2002 , the then president met in the eyes of the people who were able to stay , whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 the cane has been extracted only highly by the M@@ ole itself .

after two years the People &apos;s community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al I learned that many things are changing , but not always for the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to de@@ grade them , they also listened to the road to asphal@@ ted this , they also disadvantaged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
these were sent to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people were able to leave the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ ulate harv@@ ests bring the old soldiers a r@@ ent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month in order to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al I .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , nevertheless he gives the lies that you told him not .
they have taken him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into pensions with 65 years old , not because it is lacking in power but because it is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
start of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
youth from the First Nations community in Canada are concerned with issues that are important to them . they do so by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cre@@ e communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop is increasing by the young participants in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever it comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kit@@ sum@@ al@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; at the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women , disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youngsters did not always rule the languages of the First Nations speaking language .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has taken , the refrain from Cre@@ ate is sung .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos; we Jin@@ an is available to the St@@ anz@@ he in re@@ writing , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me .
but I try to go on to my days on earth
that is the day when you get out of our cry
because as our youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
how can they grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they determined the Creator

to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are located close to the entrance of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( on the occasion of &apos; Pl@@ astic models of the dishes &apos; ) by each sp@@ ade that is served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making this plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes that were documented by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so usually that they are not even closer to them . however , a new trend is turning them into remarkable cell phones and other gadgets .
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome released the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now on special sale : new with plastic spo@@ ilt mobile phones positioned as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ gen @-@ objects , as in this case , cooling unit magne@@ ts :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ants for a new exhibition in Tokyo .
the new boom of the foo@@ dies is becoming increasingly complicated .
in this case a c@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with sea food ) was converted to a mobile stand .
we have found a good use for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that contains your mobile phones :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ ro@@ gens is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic geri@@ atric can also be a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone @-@ stick has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ tapes from dried salmon .
other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # of the rest of the rest of the pregnancy .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of the trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who is devoted to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the Restaurant industry .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the champi@@ ons and turmoil regularly occurs in statistics . however , these reflect not the scale of the human tragedy , which this battle brings .
the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looking at the bere@@ av@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each body , behind each bon@@ net in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why the Mexican news portal from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ens@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn about the drug store &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to live this cas@@ u@@ alties and stories of people who speak in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project such :
organised crime cannot just be afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole churches have to drive many kilometers to buy something so simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for every weekend secret dig@@ gers after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , which in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ blings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task which we have placed to go and go to graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but it does not pay off because the demand a death sentence .
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we do not only have to show the faces of those who face the fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reading of animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never look at violence as normal , no matter what shape it appears :
I have known about illness and sensor@@ im@@ journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures which actually can only come from a textbook for criminals or made of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) , if he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the perpetrators when going through the streets .
for me it &apos;s like they were those who have lost anyone and those who have fear that something happened to them .
I see our weakness if stories are about mere numbers in statistics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asc@@ ending &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to engage in such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district . &quot; in this she describes how armed crime was pressed for month money from her business until they had destroyed the business not only the business , but also their families apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain over it never passes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes back up when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers as well .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will manage or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the post &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the generations of this generation . &quot;
in the introduction he asks questions like : who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - Un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all life from violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father saw , that was shot by armed men out of a squ@@ ander@@ ing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public safety and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 the Public Pro@@ secution 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de , this is equivalent to the cut 8.5 mor@@ den per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of thousands who are leaving the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories are living in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ en@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades in a simple way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages which he linked , contain images where violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment in which it comes to raise a ru@@ mor or fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something first appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was often used to use trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny it not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a pet@@ rol trucks found the place of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region had become a dangerous paths of impact , which were difficult to walk .
iron@@ ically , the pet@@ rol @-@ carriage fell victim to the victim .
official representatives describe a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing homes , including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people who are full of world champion .
houses w@@ aged and sal@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were disper@@ sed in the streets .
many people were burned to uncertainty .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ more pictures of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows shor@@ tw@@ ei@@ ved bodies that are based on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years , the same photo has been replaced several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , though , though , not related to trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the B@@ oko Har@@ am villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ yers of atrocities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burnt down and cor@@ pse , in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count the cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were broken , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images could display the follow @-@ up time .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was mistaken for the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ leading usage of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures ; Africa Check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
one step further brings personal comments like this example , accidentally , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to delivering arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a review , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported as the following that summar@@ ized these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab news page , the 2012 were mistaken , the President &apos;s Th@@ ein being said , monks and politicians could have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the picture from the DR Congo to publish this information .
the original contribution which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations which AF@@ P called their source as their source , had also mistaken Th@@ ein being wrote this statement , but did not match the image taken from the DR Congo .
the global range of false information
traces of this wrong coupling range from 2011 to 2012 and actually come back from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another picture @-@ search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images , which are similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixing of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese .
some have shared false reports , others have tried to expos@@ ing the counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
we have limited examples for the impro@@ per use and associated with the respective countries on which side they were published . thus , we want to be more clearly more evident than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here some cases , which can now be fully spread now ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
countries from false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange colored countries indicate pages or servers to the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or counterf@@ eit messages are still available .
the countries in grey are examples which are according to met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counterf@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

even within Nigeria the picture from the DR Congo was divided as evidence of the bombar@@ d@@ ments of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia provides two extreme example of a mis@@ leading usage of the picture from the DR Congo , using a twe@@ et that presses the sympathy opposite the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are per@@ secuted , as yet the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Myanmar has published an overview of what they appear as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understandings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strap , which is only published exclusively in English , contains also references to counterf@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ors that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to outline that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists kill and to the other , ( which is often widespread by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; F@@ uner@@ al Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ðµ@@ Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ð¸
this post , which was directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo are not showing Christians to kill Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page dis@@ mis@@ ed that the president of Myanmar was granted to His being 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and is still included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article by 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now , the Catholic Apostolic news page An@@ Ã¡l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly explained that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ der@@ ous assault . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ y@@ or@@ d@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , provided a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities had these events , the mut@@ in@@ ant on behalf of Islam , had a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ aty as proof of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were linked with it were taken in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnamese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , in circulation , put it on discussion like this here on Vietnamese and explained it to Fal@@ se .
from the message , in which the picture was included in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are further confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , ink is also not completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the web site and cast them over images in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original release of 2010 , the image eventually carries a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that follow these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in the context of the mysteries of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of the Muslims - the de@@ port@@ ations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life will be under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion is wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer .
with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ sely affected the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and nar@@ rows it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spreading of rap@@ ts@@ amer pictures was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the return of pictures of an incl@@ ination equ@@ ated to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and audience des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how non @-@ violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is that it is indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something which actually can be used either from the context or to completely mis@@ br@@ Ã¤u@@ k@@ ish species . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any investigation of false subsidies should also take into account both international and international . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all conflic@@ ting stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or an expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ eca language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - make you aware of your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness which one feels after watching the cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they def@@ ective other cultures , expose other thought and wake us up our curiosity .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst catastrop@@ hic catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and terrestrial disaster in that decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon which usually advocates the end of May are through strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion of the Kat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ony center of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are mixed because of the flight and mud people .
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were killed at a 30@@ 4 secure common location .
the rainf@@ all took place on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas were slowly returned .
health and hygiene in the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still far @-@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the catastrop@@ hic disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama &apos;s city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gu@@ e@@ fe@@ ver@@ ance , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday &apos;s water@@ shed of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the air @-@ monkey has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and other five are made for the transport of emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages .
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also explained to help .
Facebook @-@ Seiten in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and li@@ f@@ egu@@ ard d@@ ron@@ es require for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ needed goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 9@@ 7@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ophone centre will be informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ ny Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me gave a &quot; high @-@ water help &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for re@@ conditioning of assistance and donations . these were then passed free to the Red Cross .
likewise they introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat trips to result in high @-@ water and vom@@ iting people .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , with which multiple social media platforms are fully exhausted , residents live in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .
the Muslims , which one cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
at the women &apos;s March in San Francisco I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and love friends .
I trusted her four year old daughter , she trust her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we are calling for par@@ ole for the rights of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with cloth , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ol@@ ding slo@@ gans against anti @-@ enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
you g@@ rie@@ ve me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with this to be Muslim , in different species . but somehow we will all put all into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well constructed in our collective idea so as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit into , Muslim .
un@@ ai@@ ded will be sacrific@@ ed
I am not alone with this alone .
this is even the poet , whose poetry in America is best selling : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when one thinks of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ d was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western show the religion of Rum@@ is was cleared , as is the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduced images of Muslims , the Western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image is determined by the dark man that should be afraid and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid de@@ filed in the 1970s the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures also rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty fol@@ r@@ ative can dominate our news fe@@ eds .
this scar@@ ring o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades while the US could not even choose their first female presidential election .
this scar fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women will be hin@@ dered to carry their head towel in public buildings and su@@ ction Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that are both two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group does his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong scar is weak@@ ened Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans who were brought with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has run our collective imagination so deeply and faul@@ ty that often Si@@ kh men and children become the aim of tim@@ us@@ li@@ fic attacks and gri@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ophobia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the â¬ 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell which are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative , which help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion .
and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims account for the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the total Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewel design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York . skyscrapers were made possible by Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ cians from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ er Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , as Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now irre@@ voc@@ ally Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
sometimes people ask why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - rather than my Muslim recipes , or to bring my hand@@ bags , which all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not wear all the pocket cor@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to become almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well @-@ being Islam@@ san@@ ity Party with creditors , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for false information , which is already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger who leaves a woman with a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole of the USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms does our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it acc@@ esses our identity which is so wide , so versatile and multi @-@ faceted that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of their children &apos;s gar@@ age@@ group .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a mus@@ li@@ a was born then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ anic church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my muscular faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , I see my rock in the surf , that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that can separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and put the Arabic verses for the protection of the Quran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana Competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grandmother is the picture of my grandmother and her sisters , as she was winning a contest of the art of floral creation in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of you that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings of the old Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and one basket with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that they can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to be the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that was founded through centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; which was founded a company with the name of honour British Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather wept .
cou@@ pl@@ end@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kash@@ mir , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan , f@@ aded his family in India @-@ dominated Kash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn by coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century by a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an in@@ fashioned , Kash@@ mir of British empire , described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England .
before there were planes there , he jour@@ ne@@ yed to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion people go back deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means to remind that 14 years ago , the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops that were spread across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica to pursue mass destruction , which did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has risen more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy in the US seeks a Muslim name and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history has reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four ten hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a friendly black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African @-@ Islamic @-@ Islamic Emirate named Bil@@ ali Muhammad is ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , means the in@@ dur@@ acy inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multilingual identities , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion poses more possibilities than a sor@@ ber , but is represented in the reduction of blind@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother , to care for my child , and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this bi@@ quity , structural Islam@@ ophobia .
structural Islam hos@@ tility lies in the Muslim Registr@@ es , who began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration office which takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims in the sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we shed on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories that we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ correct picture and b@@ aten to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 on evolution .
Muslims got the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to mention the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fault of the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging prints we have in our news editorial actions .
at least there is a growing movement , headed by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to grasp our frequently @-@ pointed identities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ lement ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ mus@@ li@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , mus@@ li@@ m@@ ically , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots from media initiatives which want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned due to this difficult global time , in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason that the conspir@@ ative the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House will lead .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they have Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago it had not existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but which today made me a must @-@ found Mus@@ lim@@ a .
things that I have left here like a Br@@ ot@@ cro@@ achment track in my speech .
things that may spark memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ ctions that makes our humanity really like a story where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations in the context of the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
posters on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of the International Studies Department Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are w@@ aged and killed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public notion , four decades of even science of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves in@@ convenient questions about the role of this , consciously and deliberately to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; because the employment that we have a new future in which we have no President , the chocolate cake , while he already capit@@ ulated countries and &quot; too different &quot; people bom@@ bed , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to protect urban diversity
stories telling about Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the coverage of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported short of another initiative of Steven Bird , the in@@ en@@ force@@ able blog .
here the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate language variety of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there .
for the creators of the project :
the mass window of languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume the diversity - secure spaces , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening more often to understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make sense of feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers represent her story first in her own language and transl@@ ates or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and their representation suggests that listening to the audience .
they call forth Lau@@ ghter and Emo@@ tions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou is also taking the opportunity to explain the stories of narrative of stories for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the Fa@@ bel from the har@@ es and Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide crest , he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller .
Puerto Rico demands from the USA Neu@@ ch@@ ement of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a new check of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which participated in 72 million US dollars , participating in the Capit@@ ol , Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran down to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
she was founded by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( bourgeois front for the neur@@ as@@ ki of debts ) and the o@@ com@@ ic church meeting in Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of debts of debts have also submitted a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is her requirement :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , ban@@ kers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial examination and a guid@@ eline without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which operates in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and sup@@ pressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ ans refused to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not find themselves with decl@@ ining pensions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island - not into the state @-@ of @-@ built @-@ in @-@ area of the USA - suffer from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restruc@@ ture of state infrastructure .
the measures imposed from the outside will be risk without the participation and conviction of the citizens , to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration took the name of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

artists and writers appreciate the work of the mixed Syrian developer Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi
Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ oura .

the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian Web@@ ler K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been mixed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that will be organised in Berlin dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Head Office produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ isition ( the cost of freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that was released last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of approaches which deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in movements for free knowledge , have page on page to look over the fog that surrounds our News@@ fe@@ eds and to create something sense from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who has been de@@ tained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice which push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , namely immediately .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of temporal extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in prison Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sperson N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented herself as a in@@ sider of the Assad administration and made aware of an alleged death part against her husband .
his place and condition remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel has played a crucial role in extending access to the internet and to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologi@@ an and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ ed cultural prototypes were forward as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .

Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS was all about it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ wir@@ es but the world .
this strike in digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
iron@@ ically , Bas@@ sel has not yet finished this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dream of freedom and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other detention to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he has also taught to other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without having to actually held one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ stitute in the years 2012 till 2015 she wrote to her husband when he was in jail .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together for one year in the book .
she put the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .

it happens during each visit ,
that in the world of thy enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the cl@@ ot@@ ting at the moment in which we embrace .
that it is no matter to me any of the dangers ,

I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I dare to every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say Good@@ bye
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly returned to my lon@@ eliness ,

Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption exp@@ atri@@ ation director after o@@ dis@@ miss@@ al again to previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger against a corruption incident , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed .
this is a di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was arrested in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants due to the di@@ version of 54 million meth@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mos@@ ambique , whose council did Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called on his re@@ viewing into the company , which happened on 19 April then also .
in accordance with an opinion of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Pro@@ secutor of the Republic , who donated the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza , re @-@ refer to its old posts since the company does not complete discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ming after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , in short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director :
represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that the company should also have a lack of discipl@@ in@@ ating proceedings against the counter @-@ resistance movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company seems to be careful , however and prompted no adequate legal action to apply the appropriate functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reluct@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Cam@@ b@@ aza were a competent type , he would be counsel@@ or after he was sentenced to a sentence and caused half to eat .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and under@@ pin his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped cause damage .
thus it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for its silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , Young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director without any morality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already offen@@ ded so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking to return mor@@ als and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only serves themselves by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ ele it had become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money of money , and the state itself is we@@ ary to this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
Die@@ th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el . Mozambique is not only to be remembered as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , sh@@ atter@@ ing and - next door - prophe@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he was energetic , confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is in@@ capable of all , even the father@@ land for its ambitions , to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics but he does not change its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also declined :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for ten years and was free .
and today he sets him the company where he will be de@@ filed with money again , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Fur@@ niture or Cre@@ ations . ( @ az@@ times _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ aged .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported
according to information by Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people with East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or on the en@@ closure of the site . ( in bur@@ mes@@ ic script ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radic@@ alist movements of the word has given an extreme con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly uses ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech to Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sen@@ sel@@ ess content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically generated by hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use of use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ ic words with fundamental meanings which have the same code as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ lin@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( camel ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post by one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether she knew how he could rel@@ ieve his back pain by making a word play .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ gment ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there have been different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it will reduce comb@@ ative language to radical national nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook analy@@ tic must be analytical before it trig@@ gers all Po@@ sts that are in the suspicion of racism .
Facebook solved the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automation will not understand what you write to Fac@@ il@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the mail and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ tine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( age ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread that hate speech , have received a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ised their nationalism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ating hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy might not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have demonstrated that the cens@@ or@@ ship of impact is often a kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby users should simply start social networks , to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to notify my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and it was prohibited to me the Li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards not correspon@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Po@@ sts of people who don &apos;t have any negative purposes or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical national nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post office without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention of reducing racism in Burma due to their platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ or such words will bring only more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and so words like &quot; throne &quot; or &quot; pe@@ y@@ curr@@ y &quot; have forbidden .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted Po@@ sts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefit , which gives them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks provide automatic cens@@ or@@ ship for much sp@@ ott among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now turn over Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts , which have not contained hate speech , but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and take a pe@@ y@@ curr@@ y and see an Indian film .
just to check out if Facebook removes the post office that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

scre@@ enshot is used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to raise violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to critici@@ zing the star@@ ving hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of just getting the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would be better to focus more on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is concluded with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously , a law adopted by the country , which aims to ban this practice , so that the mar@@ ginal age now is at 18 .
prior to this change of the adul@@ tery , some members of the du@@ alistic and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities took place at the practice , and in May 2016 , the leaders of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , told that the state shall not interfere with , since that , age do not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a busin@@ es@@ spartner at the UN Human Rights Convention , for the min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married in 15 was already married , in Trinidad and Tobago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical government of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were eager to manage laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed on the base and pleasing his great support . undoubtedly helped them to bring this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leader , for instance , had no concern to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n &apos;t worry about their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was sort of tension in this actually complicated thing , and at some point in doubt , whether the opposition would agree with the bill of the law .
but early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one against it .
after having decided before in the Senate , the design can now become a law .
the majority of the social media @-@ media was enthusiastic , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ Member Lo@@ vell Francis , who clo@@ th@@ ed a ministry in the ministry of Education , said :
it has so much time and unnecessary talk that has spar@@ ed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago for now , and that is almost every price worth it .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to manage the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which states : , , revealing news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ INA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the hei@@ gh@@ tened age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious , 18 years .
the draft to the change of the German law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and there were 35 in the vote present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MPs , who were opposed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ eria @-@ ild@@ ed .
many thanks to all activists who have put it out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed its intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be passed and he seems to now trigger his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the General State At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the Law , supposedly , it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would like to proceed against the law , that most social media users wish to tackle the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , when we , instead of talking about the discussion so generally , in a way that we would like to invite the state to our bedroom , &quot; simply responding to it that the state , our daughters from before them safegu@@ ards that they are possibly used by large , hard @-@ driven men who are faced with them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legal in different gra@@ dations or continue to be standard , even though there are laws they are talking .

through the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the USA , internationally approved .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now pl@@ ung@@ ed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia .
day by day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and to share reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV @-@ series are opposed to the block .
although many technology @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use str@@ aps tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society where Harvard University has been held , regular block@@ ers of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , following the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
after China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ ate sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( i.e. computer @-@ computer connection ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available despite legal ban but is available .
in a blo@@ gger article IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
once we have heard the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) we decided to locate Sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the contents in de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step is conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock .

you attack on a different URL that is not the original one . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .

a Nep@@ alese Wild chore@@ ographer uses his camera to raise awareness of the need for nature conservation
a addic@@ tive rhin@@ ocer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around for around , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
the motivated him to carry on a camera with himself and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ as wildlife tries to bring an international stage .
and his hometown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that leads the attention on Nep@@ alese animals .
he described on Facebook , how he helps him this first @-@ class location in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had given a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran into my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to fold pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
and he should know it because he already stood on face to face to face :
a tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not at bed@@ time ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately sits , we see ourselves and he tac@@ kled me through the Sal trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked on environmental protection ) in his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make at the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
see below some of these photos below .

a revised version was published here as part of a Content @-@ sharing Convention again .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding the greatest care to address the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to get this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a black@@ out and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a si@@ rat@@ ernity of relatives .
the tradition her spouse will also not be called by name , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less to fear signs , if at all , what , should they fail to practice this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , joined together nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and thus became the main council of the city .
it is a place just for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al which is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ rat to the ex@@ iting of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and guides these clubs .
it reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that showed the Roh@@ ini in their discussion , was the women whose spouses do not name their hus@@ bands &apos; name .
she has chosen this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that the women can easily identify with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of their hus@@ bands are not to be utter@@ ed according to their hus@@ bands &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a Br@@ ist , whom they have ple@@ aded not guilty and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected by her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not with@@ stand this is seen as a c@@ unn@@ ingly , as a woman with no mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband on behalf so far , try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh for a long time after the video was finished .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on to his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage Roh@@ ini started their first disc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some felt that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the Round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to put discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never had to speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she had brought only before his whole exercise , another decided to let the whole ru@@ gged frustration against him and his family by giving it off .
the term on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the ad@@ renalin rush to have broken with an old bread , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands upon their name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband &apos;s husband called upon Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member decided to do it in dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she studied , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a Candi@@ date was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the pet@@ rol @-@ red spot on the forehead , which shows the divorce .
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would wear the cin@@ ome red spot if he t@@ asked it too .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to carry him .
the other women have not ceased completely with it , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose himself , not to wear him in some days .
for many women the disc@@ us@@ sion@@ s@@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at any Dis@@ cussion , a trip . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack some lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months she celebrated her own birth days with cakes for the first time in her life ; she danced and sang about things they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identities on our spouses , never said so honest .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only contributed to Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most is the okay , but some wanted to carry a sal@@ ta spa , a wide Hem@@ d over a pants , they have not dar@@ ed .
after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ selection , the mor@@ als connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , smug@@ gling Roh@@ ini into a panel discussion , so that the women could carry them .
next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will succeed .
on the question whether in the five months a bit has changed since their first discussion track , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only taken small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but heard then again to say the name of their hus@@ k .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and are not members of the family members .
only one or two are still saying the name of their hus@@ bands &apos; ; only one or two women carry out in their forehead at any time .
women in the Dis@@ cussion @-@ sk@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fet@@ ching to find more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ selection - at the end of a hard to navig@@ ating flow .
by giving each other self confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declared :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am also .
however , this club also gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ int people for organizing trade , probably for scr@@ ast@@ ful purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been be@@ headed and some of the organs have been extracted .
two men were arrested and imprisoned in the episode that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are exploited .
there are the local super@@ sti@@ tions , that the head of a gl@@ aring man can bring gold or riches , the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ he@@ iser of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on glaz@@ ed men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the aim of for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with alchem@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 has conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique trips in Mozambique are the goal of ritu@@ alistic At@@ tac@@ ks , war@@ es the Mos@@ lem police after the latest designs of three glaz@@ ed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the fac@@ tions were taken , arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mos@@ ambique , said that the local police are already going on :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the gl@@ aring men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of gl@@ int individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has been considering the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches of the riches .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair @-@ cas@@ u@@ ities in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique faces :
I &apos;d like to go to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , May@@ be ashamed of a country where people would love to go on the streets and others would not hurt sex , or even their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or he@@ aters for the unbeliev@@ ing purpose or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted that aim to accum@@ ulate wealth .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the incar@@ nate Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer in its final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which was required for the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has described Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or permit him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely absent from the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met in the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man rejected it to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit Li@@ u abroad a treatment .
Norway to Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway became Sto@@ ve after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon heading to China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
once the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee put his hope for a unconditional release to express and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
because of his detention , he was not able to counter@@ act his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest , and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us as they did in an Declaration on 30 June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are supposed to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to freely communicate with the outside world .
us in the USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect he may help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary in Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , announced that the message of the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
the call of the US message passed a fur@@ ious response from China to Himself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to turn into an isolated and un@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley dealt with that China should offer the couple the following :
to protect and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they have been entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations .
the US @-@ Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that it can enter into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on July 7 and 8 at G@@ 20 in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could sur@@ face the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28th , the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um , called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Li@@ u with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
McC@@ all@@ um tells the following :
Canada calls China to release its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to protect and release the rights of these rights for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called on China in an Declaration on 29 June on Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to make sure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news sender of France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , announced the State Department , that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take part .
Taiwan in Taiwan
the Council of the Council of Taiwan in Taiwan called on 27 June to allow Li@@ u to release a greater tolerance toward those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the ta@@ i@@ wan@@ ese Legisl@@ ative Society of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Li@@ u , and gave you that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , led to a harmon@@ ic , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
licence : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or land ?
the question may seem fool@@ ish as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at the international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ gh@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this remark in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere has triggered a debate .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the Law@@ yers Association of the State of New York , the Minister of New York noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries .
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody questioned whether new York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , you can say that we are not at least one country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ gh@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of what he appeared un@@ inevitably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers , who pretend to give Democrats , abandoned logic , since it fits better with their power .
in the end of the final week the Shan@@ gh@@ gam were given the answers to his American guests in regard to our press , our Ju@@ dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ts it with non @-@ answers and rational ways .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gh@@ gam to make his mind clear as it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our precious K Shan@@ gh@@ gam will take the trouble to raise this point if he was paid up to be part of the city &apos;s government in Singapore .
by publishing its comment on the blog , he points to the cri@@ tiques to read the entire co @-@ address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gh@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the manuscript .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , why the elections in Singapore be so un@@ important , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment in Shan@@ gh@@ gam , which makes the leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very embarrassed ...
at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old wardrobe that expects me - whether I disagree with them or not , but this is another matter .
but with K. Shan@@ gh@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes , and become aware of what he is defending .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review breaks down the weaknesses of Shan@@ mug@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ gh@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has made a mistake by Mr. Shan@@ gh@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian voc@@ alist ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique ; it is equally urban and city .
as he plays an important role within the governance , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gh@@ gam are of heavy importance .
why do the Singapore authorities do their military service , defend it only their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills back ?
what is the value of our pink Head@@ count ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a town :
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many of the Singapur ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we have always been a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world uncovered and another fac@@ et should be shown .
the newest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question which is put to me most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions .
on my clear position then mostly the standard rep@@ t : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ic@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook some in@@ war@@ dly against anger , if they are held for Americans , but me don &apos;t bother .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Germans , however ... .
so it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , in front of the invasion of Iraq and 11 September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
like @-@ sex marriages , have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also regarded as the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends , which I appreciated very much .
there would be nothing for me if you would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being said to be &quot; nice &quot; means essentially to be able to be id@@ le - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tragic , in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; cute &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to which you can come across .
being harmless , is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen to one around .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , a leading property of Can@@ adi@@ ans is .
we tend to deal with our own matters only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence across the fence .
we are missing the warm , open friendliness that I have now combined with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has published a music video , which took the jun@@ ta and restore power in 2014 and restore the civilian government , despite their promise of restoring the civilian government .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) is the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells him his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was great success .
in the first three days , this was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist invited the public to look at this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policies , in@@ special how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
once you have a look at this recording of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has per@@ secuted in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gave the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , absolute decision @-@ making power on important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program to &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and clear rules are often used by the authorities to oppose activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also established , the online content is monitored and people who have thrown , the monarchy is sl@@ ander@@ ed to have pro@@ secuted .
Thailand continues to put an attack against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty insul@@ ting ) through .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was set up in Thailand .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to per@@ secuted , is their decision expensive U boats to buy , although security professionals they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , even how persons are thrown into a black supply chain , before putting them into an interim camp , another problem fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because it is alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet users are threatened for a long time to off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; was used by put@@ sch under the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Asia .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ ian war has been officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic .
the deserted villages of the northern bor@@ ks in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , for the most part Russians and Ab@@ h@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , there are still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district of 16@@ ,000 people , after having risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early six@@ ties , which are called Chr@@ u@@ gl@@ adi@@ kov@@ kas are symbolic for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it falls him hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; Why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gartens , served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ lown splend@@ or buildings .
the people that once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning business of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which can sleep still one or two families , one recognizes on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discovered me with the camera in his hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother is forbidden to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to their girlfriend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetables .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
the district administration supplies free candles in the winter and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman pulled with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial help from her daughter and insisted that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives .
aunt G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with its own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she talks about her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asch@@ a , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s inter@@ part@@ um Nat@@ asch@@ a lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asch@@ a was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds himself of the thor@@ ny before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ asien broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ li@@ i ( administrative de@@ be@@ headed stadt in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to build a house there , but that will still take a little , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ asch@@ a receives some $ 9 children for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ a kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , man@@ e and chickens .
she tells that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or a few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day like the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation ends with the end , a little boy over us passes over .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him back .
he plays with the ball , which then rolls up the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ ayed building .
these ruins are a part of their childhood who care for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to her long journey
Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and is here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old of Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ ers , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ eb@@ ell and gold @-@ colored ear @-@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Wall@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night can sleep in simple rooms , with cold , cru@@ mb@@ ling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , people come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ ons .
it does not want anyone to refuse .
she also helps them and bring them to hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that cre@@ ted away from long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ chin ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it fits to it because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hope to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and take direction north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route and that the Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as builders at construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket according to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez told that her guests can send their often text messages if they have gone to gr@@ ate them or to report on the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel by Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were incorporated in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has stated that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep at blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was subsequently exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travels through Wall@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to ma@@ ze money by him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , single @-@ known , has offered him its roof .
some months later the family still lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travellers look quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a major part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone .
like a proud grandmother , she is fed in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair care that her has made a customer , some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , as she asked me shortly .
&quot; Ya &quot; fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; they repeat each time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install on their mobile phones to install a surveillance app .
a check @-@ Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users on the occasion of the creation of the en@@ closure .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities area in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the phone users received a mobile notification in the Tian@@ shan District of the city of Uru@@ m@@ qi . a mobile notification where it indicates the district government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , it is said that the app will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but col@@ Ã²@@ n@@ able the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private we@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the No@@ tification of the police , the app will determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block@@ ade por@@ no@@ graphy website , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities of this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark ones for those who live in distant countries like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet shut@@ downs .
that on Twitter @-@ based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( on the outskirts of the en@@ closure of the site ) , the cens@@ ored messages published in China , showed photos from a check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an the residents had un@@ checked , as if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity through the rest of mountainous technology .
we are back to ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( on the outskirts of the en@@ closure of the site ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang Product description , deri@@ ves from the fact that the software can lift the password &apos;s requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets full access to the hard disk of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city @-@ party to minimize the proliferation of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and the related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report from Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi , a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police register .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy them . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible benefits , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane increases his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at you and make sure that you are all alone in a place where all things have gone .
everything has split up and down and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from the inside and outside .
one who makes her name all glory .
one that has raised itself into a list of feelings and expressions , who do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if you &apos;re taking the reality back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and performers - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even though the Earth is spinning on the axis of the disaster . you &apos;ll realize that you are trapped between the walls , which your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone up stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have been arrested for me and my father 3 times , but that did not have enough to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the boss of the security service he form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put his power over us by giving even the simplest concepts destroyed we knew .
five teenagers were torn away from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to be the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ al Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the city districts on , only my own one .
for the first time it was quiet , we@@ t@@ lessly , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city that has stri@@ pped up into the arteries with state @-@ organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce .
in the third night , things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the quarter were to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice in the silence of the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we ended up to a glorious picture that filled my expectations completely and fully .
in such a moment you become aware that you are able to liber@@ ate the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the bar@@ ley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid down .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you your voice after you put them all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you &apos;re able to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are just brave enough to cry out if we are not close by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes looked at me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you truly love yourself what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; maybe in the revolution .
I was so sure about my job when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I have never ceased to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret any word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in sol@@ itary and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ran through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I tra@@ verse with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the individual cells .
I have prepared all the details exactly before I s@@ ling the room .
unlike otherwise they have probably allocated to me a larger cell this time .
I have to share them with just one more prisoner , and may put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I reached an old @-@ established communication method : with the fist to beat the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ cre@@ ti@@ mate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he answered me ultimately .
apparently he was in none of the surrounding cells a respectable man middle aged that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness there can be no distinctive facial trains , and doctors are not there here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot;
all the answers is one of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will listen immediately .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would hate him when I stay .
liar .
I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ h@@ ein@@ ous to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , who laboratories in the garden of my head in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always with this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of the grave , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to listen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the secret of the secret : to protect the state security before us and preventing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they talk in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their den@@ omin@@ ational black@@ board and rie@@ ve the close viewpoint of their world view .
this is not a house that is here not a country ; it is a curse to name co @-@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I raised the hear@@ ed and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join so much more important with your life when you join this day and to protest on demonstrations that will soon become an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do not rep@@ lied .
I used to get used to it , not to answer .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows after a friendly conversation for me has become an ordinary communication means .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to it , although I had not done anything to make this punishment .
on punishment in all their diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably originates from the clo@@ ak .
your head@@ sman like to am@@ use your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not yet enough , so they inter@@ changeable the reed through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if investig@@ ators had worked earlier as a trash collection or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ woven in order to present us the , from their perspective , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them rarely altern@@ ates three of them while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am .
the head@@ sman spot@@ ted the cooling and found no favor by it , which is why it accepted as neighbour@@ ly to an electric drive .
flow through my entire body , enough to supply all my quarter .
my half @-@ bare body , which was stretched out on the floor was the perfect stream leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to lay back sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours went out , who came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of a creative people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful troubles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and away you , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ al R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community , free expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ at H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the bulk of his time indo@@ ors ; sometimes he s@@ add@@ les on his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its co@@ il@@ ted lips to discover .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Farmer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for now six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and asks their alt@@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his music , which often proceeds with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian people , but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking by borders , and it can be according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he is opposed to the American foreign policy a particular a@@ version .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian de@@ ple@@ ted &quot; of the second generation - so he himself was born , even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured into water sol@@ dered Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is fores@@ een for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ al law also states that public consumption of food during Ramad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancest@@ ral traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has a little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the slaugh@@ tered hot coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the c@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially if you have a look to neighboring countries .
from this , it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramad@@ an , to drink water - in order to land not in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens made an appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islam@@ ische Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ al branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ tal Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall .
the S &amp; D spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which provides an established legitimacy of authorit@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ ant people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continued to stand up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement would probably not simply be simply sil@@ ken rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but in fact a clearly reflected reality in Jordan reflecting in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards to be Lei@@ be by having his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently lower @-@ down @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
human Rights Watch said that the number of Hon@@ orary people in 2016 reached their climax ; however it is still troubled that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence , to provide adequate consideration .
according to a law to fight corruption from the year 1954 , women , who are suspended in prison at un@@ certain time , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman is not going to happen .
even H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known also not to shy back from themes which in his country long as tab@@ ular .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , he adm@@ its his music , which is full of explicit anch@@ or@@ ations on sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was introduced to politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs which are in the core are political , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; what you want &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - be faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments regarding equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya to note later that his comments were ri@@ pped from the context and was cens@@ ored by his opinion .
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a working copy , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b buys open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained in mind today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ ts who later should work on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ um , in the eighth century could write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why could Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tish Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government has sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al Intelligence service took place several former governmental bodies and members of the association , with the grounds , they would have expressed critical on comments in social media critical about the problems that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s opinion is that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural upheav@@ al in the next generation of the Jordan paper .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has passed for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , depres@@ ses and in@@ war@@ y changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ al society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region with the help of music , art and literature is becoming a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , spreading uni@@ forms and in artificial Art . at least he hopes that .
until it is so far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will res@@ ign and consequently also resistance .
this report was heard by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which belongs to A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of Neb@@ uta Festival .
we suspected that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals is celebrated for usually also in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory implies that the r@@ ams , the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered , in the armies from the west of Japan to mar@@ ched in the Nor@@ theast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to force in his knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two months exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( verb@@ ati@@ l ) .
I saw this for a long time again the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two festivals are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and thus a stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high stance was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body@@ care as important as in this story , because they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and promote an legitimate profession like the hair@@ style of the hair .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where stre@@ et@@ b and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to that more and more civil@@ ised among the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to maintain their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get training in the hair@@ style of hair that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ dder opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special educational workshops in March and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love notes on guer@@ rilla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; love message of guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the entry is published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love notes to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel forced to carry out affection ?
exactly this question went out of the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the foundation of Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , by the Young Youth Youth Foundation , and inspired them to the campaign C@@ art@@ as por la Re@@ v. li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla warfare .
only recently , their land was the place of a historic event , and they wanted to help her part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colom@@ bian ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace contract as such significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos for his merits was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
but a long way ahead of the Colom@@ bian is still a long way until one can talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla warfare , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , subjected to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and bore their arms around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society again , who had accustomed themselves to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian should join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ rilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ rilla war that will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk about K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this declared that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love notes , but those forget that they need much unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plans , he told him further , this year he told his love with people who was most urgent .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolum@@ bi@@ ens such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , hosted by the Foundation Bogot@@ art , in the camp to transmit the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to counter@@ act the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of under@@ mining people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after we passed the letters , a former comb@@ at@@ ants led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a type of hut , in which the guer@@ rilla warfare , I saw an guer@@ rilla war that wrote something .
I was afraid to accept , because beside him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ce , a deadly weapon in the cro@@ chet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that somebody has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never before in my life somebody has written something so nice , so I will answer it . suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him very well and sat down alongside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ce .
maybe he was tired too , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
the pr@@ el@@ ude came together and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a panel discussion .
the students grew up all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already appeared in the dark .
therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state have responded to the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the company in this country more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this scale , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never been hearing and had no election law , and to realize that people , whom I have often seen as a monster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment were very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ern was rep@@ uted that after dra@@ fting peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack the weapons , rise up and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all the defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in Cau@@ c@@ asian region are subjected to broad range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror milit@@ ants have seen the reporting of the last months about the persecution of pregnant men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat that depends on like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ist over the dor@@ m LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not first created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and spoke with us about what is currently happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after the reports have been published , the deterior@@ ations , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chn@@ ya authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men soli@@ ds and they were hidden in Ar@@ gun pris@@ ons .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since their childhood she felt that she was in fact a woman .
when she was grown , she became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had been experienced by the sex mer@@ ging of their land@@ lady , hunting was opened on Sabrina .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the USA in the end .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ wife who stuck in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hesitation .
while I tried to help her , did someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen &apos;s friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos taken from my documents by the very W@@ hat@@ s@@ App took the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was right there , I heard a couple of shopping from my car &apos;s back home , I heard a men &apos;s vote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I revol@@ ved , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Che@@ chn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you dish@@ on@@ ate the family , you sc@@ and@@ ed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I know only that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and the last analysis in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ f@@ aded in my right @-@ wing &apos;s wings .
OC Media : in which health wings were you placed - in the men or women of women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor did understand and lay me among the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with the fear ; it was a mus@@ li@@ ous , a cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted me to come in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that everything was just evil , and Photoshop .
I have bas@@ king size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for her .
some older people spoke once my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only your family , but the entire Republic .
we can not stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car was covered with dark windows and a h@@ ash plate with a 95 dr@@ unken .
once it happened for the third time , I realized that something was lazy .
my human right friends checked the number@@ ing plates - it turned out that I was followed .
OC Media : how did you buy ?
Sabrina : with the help of activ@@ ist activists .
out of security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the land , but then something happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived .
I bought them , without sign me , without comm@@ ing , without anything .
I dis@@ rupted my old SIM card and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
came on and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be sure in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ ar . you even know your number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my number .
OC Media : do you still stand in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ ular issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still tra@@ ded some traditional cau@@ c@@ asian elements still in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome these spiritual barriers .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to see how the person un@@ cover , that they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who made an hour and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the month of Ramad@@ an there were no human being arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait for , and he did not closed a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my I , they probably load the relatives , these take care of the problem with the concerned person and in the end we are calling for an evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are also now a gay men are held in these secrets ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there were just not very many .
if , above all those who have no wealthy relatives , or those who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that you can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be converted , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but rather sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alize .
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there has been no news of them since .
they have just taken them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was even when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they were not presented as a banker so far there were no reports until now . but we suspect such actions are indeed possible .
why otherwise would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orientation already in the past ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sabrina : I loved my hair for a long time .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known to Gros@@ ny when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than it is now .
Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; Civil ization &quot; but ultimately has taken us back to the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were sil@@ enced ; I had colored eyelashes , wearing ro@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short tro@@ ops .
the security of sh@@ aria has never been bent over me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it : they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ ck does not say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you often say it to children if that make themselves fun over sick .
OC Media : so they just did their eyes shut up in front of you because they believed you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace keep up ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister 2005 , he began to speak on television about morality .
he did not talk about us , but above the conduct of women .
nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change .
he who had previously sm@@ iled and yellow , regarded you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could sense how the situation in the Republic constantly swal@@ lowed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I have not earned a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much .
besides that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , meetings , I beg@@ ged them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ ti@@ fs .
I have not pen@@ ny for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves , when I cur@@ sed them .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ old .
so nature , that has purely nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to proph@@ esi@@ ed with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wings in them .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ians have who have the Cabal , who have the Russians , and all the planets there are - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it is unpleasant for me to listen to .
here are so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practi@@ sing Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramad@@ an - living with men together .
you know , many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a truste@@ e .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise , different life settings .
for me it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I am sorry that I will be here as personal , but my last intimate relationship is already longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian ancest@@ ral region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate among the local Arab population . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the last months there is a strong increase in self @-@ murder .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ma@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th re@@ marked the dist@@ res@@ sed situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness that can count the in@@ ability for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who work in Ah@@ ma@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube gave the moments after it had ign@@ ited himself .
some people made it quick to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ma@@ z .
local sources said the inc@@ iner@@ ation were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activ@@ ist on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable due to the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where most of the Arab ancestors living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their living .
in the beginning of a century , Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ma@@ z region , there are some of the largest in @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most sought @-@ reaching and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically employment in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ s built , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are .
these dam@@ s have only led to exac@@ erb@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused in the region and to destroy local farming as well as fishing and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arabic A@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director @-@ Director for Co @-@ operation , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , sign@@ alled that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who seek a job , completed the elementary school , finished 55 % a further school and have 45 % university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an ir@@ anic Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; lead to a &quot; high increase in &quot; the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of genealo@@ gy and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
as function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will disp@@ ose of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their homeland .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , because even Arabic names are not tolerated , because the speaking of the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , which must endure the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , the human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and hom@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I did not identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through thought , scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be femin@@ ists and why we generally ought to be the femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women still stand under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women are in a flat blan@@ ket sooner or later in various fields of life , and that discrimination can still move across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am twice and three , including .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I &apos;m talking on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black transi@@ ents , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from Diaspora , if I mention , on which species we have been physically , spiritual and verbal , have to mention both in and outside of feminist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to up@@ lift &quot; their voices , and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , an institution@@ alised form is an institution@@ alised form of violence , which we are exposed to black women on two times .
or in addition , black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin cities less than white men and women .
that black girl and girl with a migration background more often the school is referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are subjected to a higher risk of suffering and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in a partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people with no skin colour . on the other hand I can &apos;t join me as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands , ref@@ uses to consider inj@@ us@@ tices in their thinking that relate to the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am de@@ ple@@ ted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner said 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a incar@@ nate and margin@@ alised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs , in order to advance its ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer seek to give white women the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to worship them of a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was established in order to give women of different schools and diver@@ ge themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to det@@ ach me full of femin@@ ism and join me to the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than being ins@@ istent for a white @-@ feminist paradigm which is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark on the spheres , which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book African Mar@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can conquer ourselves , that we can defend ourselves upon our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a blur@@ red environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I existed .
I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being &apos;s one as a part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment in which my life is neither overwhelmed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ ad@@ del@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental issues .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is published here again .
again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern throughout Kurdistan in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost as I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country have to fear that the decades of war , construction of reservoir , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ epers - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - which is committed to helping protect the rivers , cre@@ eks and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq based documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published .
the focus of their work lies on per@@ secuted , little considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their harder fight against violence
a group of women is &quot; the crying women &quot; to express their pain across the women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by curator . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # L@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) who reported on violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been modified to protect the persons affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partner who had become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship had passed some time and the police said their statement would be placed on the acts , but more could you do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena used for failure , useful also the cat@@ ered display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later the second woman went back to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women report at all once , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who are suspi@@ ci@@ ble . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported at all with the law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 pun@@ ches and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible Mis@@ sions and a legal system , which is nothing lower @-@ 3 of Paraguay laws : good approach , defici@@ ent r@@ ack@@ downs and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are genuinely mis@@ leading , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports , but not even ans@@ ing the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , at the District Court Pro@@ secutor 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peac@@ ekeeping sector . here , 86 % of the indicators came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically challenged , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
but these statistics indicate not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to data of the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen &apos;s minister@@ ial Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these off@@ ences are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who re@@ funded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who are re@@ funded because of physical failure , come two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s su@@ icide is not a criminal off@@ ences , law enforcement authorities can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
alone up to August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay up to every ten days a woman is killed by men .

invisible dis@@ appearances and a legal system , which does not take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t really want it , but then after . this was supposed to rep@@ ent it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable :
I never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
if I have read earlier about it , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ jection , because they are decei@@ ved themselves by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never ever happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure have at least had some compassion to blame for it .
Victoria San@@ tos that did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner has her mist@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o , CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with a psychological abuse .
her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads among the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against their former partners who developed into an un@@ manage@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power , and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays Law : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not being used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great issues in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ id@@ ra ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law considers to be explained to a stand@@ ardis@@ ed criminal , and to pun@@ ish harder , as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the draft text was altered in some points in order to also win the MEPs for the law that feared that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is being forbidden , which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures that have to bear the victims of violence in the present time , if they simply want to report , and want to receive a secure accommodation to the state .
echo@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial means to this :
in Paraguay it is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations .
here a change must take place , so that violence is no longer considered to be accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not guilty in the face of these facts and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators come from offen@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to refund for as long as this is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law were changed , but among other things a passage was cancelled , which had called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the dispute of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law does not apply as a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper further exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a meeting of the information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is locked on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forbidden newspapers Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the Sultan .
You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he died a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but later returned .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had left his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : prime minister , Defense Minister , Ober@@ ster commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the central bank .
the domination of the Sultan is marked by the pers@@ ist@@ y efforts of security forces , including domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , res@@ isters and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and to imprisonment .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , also activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in government and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closing and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard hit for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in Oman since its inception in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor of Az@@ am@@ n received an article titled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; hands in the judiciary on 26 July 2016 . in this , it was about corruption in the Judi@@ ciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused accused of having put pressure of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties viol@@ ate hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the editorial committee , invited by the ISS and was arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was held by the Deputy Chief of You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who joined Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as a chief editor .
the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information minister had given the statement , that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison terms , and also arranged the final closure of the paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by interference of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; submission of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 tom@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a sentence amoun@@ ted to 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of &quot; an information network to spread the material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail of â¬ 5000 has been fixed for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from detention already on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to the exile of his six months prison sentence . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he died his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper looks like prior to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on January 8 the information minister allowed a directive with which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister personally signed an additional directive in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister has appointed another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al to permit the publication of the paper .
the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman in recent times .
for further violations include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set off their operation .
because of the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the Peruvian authorities :
1 . You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediate and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists will be able to pursue their work .
3 . protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman dis@@ continued their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of prevention measures , including judicial ra@@ ids .
the Gulf of Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of expression and the right to gather peacefully , supports and provide them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ se@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for treatment on @-@ site medical research : for instance , a lack of healthcare and vaccines have a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious in the poorest countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , at building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Central Reser@@ vation at the Centre for research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media on this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as an individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic National Programme for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also started developing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what are your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers rather than being makers .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it &apos;s difficult to find people who want to go back or here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it cost a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the easy access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed manufacturers will change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems in the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has already taught a salad for the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ let &apos;s , the first plant , which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ Astron@@ au@@ ts .
for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was placed only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many sal@@ ads he can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , so that he could not use it on breeding .
patents stand not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or grass@@ roots or we@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been filed on more plants such as grain or cart@@ els . due to these trends plant @-@ breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton still lacks salad , but he now needs a longer time since his work is always worth more and more constraints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river lie a rock that I p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far to sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand to court , no one can breed any new let@@ tu@@ bs , because all the features are patented . &quot; he is doing so good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Sp@@ ac@@ station ISS have red Roman sal@@ at of the variety outlet in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and ate . there &apos;s tested if plants are grown in space .

it &apos;s no coincidence that this name sounds rather that the movement from the IT field would come and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open @-@ Source &quot; -@@ seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched to make sure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders .
within the framework of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can ple@@ dge that others may use the seeds to use them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds , and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders simply allow others who are able to buy seeds , to breed as their own varieties , and it is not immediately ex@@ orbit@@ ing - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ents or prescribed .
dozens of breeders and seeds companies have already joined forces in 2014 since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection .
seeds said to him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to not use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically altered or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the development of chemicals and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Monsanto and Bayer , which in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way in which the vegetables are bred , is threatened .
nutritional sou@@ ps without seed estates is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to provide others with seeds to provide other seeds . in this way , its approach is patent @-@ related , unlike seeds , seeds and plant @-@ features .
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available gene pool due to the ever @-@ growing intellectual property rights on plant material , which thus becomes increasingly more restric@@ tive , is inc@@ ess@@ antly shr@@ ink .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ els as intellectual property is protected , making it possible for plant breeders either not or only usable .
for other plants there are not such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ thin plants such as wheat are patented in a larger style as a salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated as they have targeted characteristics - of such , by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they with@@ stand in certain environments , and threats like p@@ ests and diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eder by more and more patents decreases . genetic variety is currently unnecessary than ever before , as the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto spokes@@ woman in C@@ early Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activity . with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company has established itself for the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it considers that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant versions innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everybody can follow , as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection is not inhi@@ bited innovation , i.e. innovation not , but promotes the public to provide more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other thing : 20 years to wait , until a patent has been consumed , there is certainly no innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general well and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ aries incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will make us impossible if we can not continue using the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of Mor@@ ton has interfer@@ ed with the concept of itself , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we finally have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed a variety , ch@@ asti@@ se his own values in them .
who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides , the ch@@ asti@@ est in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just structured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are patents , create it most smaller seed companies , even without patents , they either reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton looks for sal@@ ads in his far@@ med garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ties would be : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent .
I need a constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you can be 20 years ago from competition , what makes it very nice in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Center for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
she also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding ) differ from country to land , whose Os@@ si commitment cannot simply be one at one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . in this way , she talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office , which has allowed patents in conventional re@@ bred plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the patent @-@ office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn more about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed companies and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems declares that the organization currently construc@@ ts a global alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . it represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to contribute to seeds , to exchange and improve seed policy , so that a stable supply can be ensured on foods .
in the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems , a connection , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have rarely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is still more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , the Egyptian authorities still locks content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of May 5 , the Egyptian government p@@ iled the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above all @-@ mentioned .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
to defend the Network for Human Rights Information , despite this attack and the constitution by the authorities , which the law ought to defend , to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirmed that all the technical possibilities must be exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to im@@ itate . we insist on it to continue to fulfil our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , following the official news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site releases for the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI is also based on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights research Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada uses his blog for the dissemination of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write to Egypt websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog was he taught to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , which is located on the site of Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , continues to be accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , as the police critic@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada came to the block by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to block is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the block@@ age of the blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded to give me the sense of a si@@ ege ; an arrest , an attempt of murder , sub@@ loading at the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to get the cens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ tigen go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this produces technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block from suppliers through the byp@@ assing of inter@@ net@@ tle and private browsing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noted how the blocking of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally sad@@ dened by the fact that the cens@@ ors are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , using which it can address the court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day by day newspaper in Brazil with gri@@ m head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of a number of postcard theme .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ one second day will be assass@@ inated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and lu@@ pin in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the rule of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice had even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
for detailed reporting of violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra , on 16 August , editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual inter@@ rup@@ ting , etc . everything , however , from the civil@@ ised standard , and what happens only in Rio , will call in the section &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to us as journalists not close our eyes to the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video , a journalist der newspaper declares that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that war discourse when it is distor@@ ted , even if it can be used to di@@ stract atrocities and then questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it is useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil argum@@ ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the contrary , call the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is according to a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police to account .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military units in Rio itself has shown - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
to remember : the Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 to the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per state of state , Rio on No. 16 , &quot; writes them .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for years .
to these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a massive police investigations into a Fav@@ ela and permanently to stationary a unit permanently .
in the beginning , this was actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP , after several reports on Shi@@ ps and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under blame .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux taken from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name of &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio has also been serious consequences for the human being .
for this is calling for the state to use means and ways which are typical of a war . to this end , penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an in@@ discern@@ ed point in the countryside and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; cle@@ fied bul@@ lets . &quot;
war on or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police cl@@ amped the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
amidst all these violence also this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit res@@ eller died as a result of shots , which had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : bel@@ ated Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot of the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly through Assad &apos;s regime towards loy@@ alist forces .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and the Land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially strongly affected is the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack against chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition go from , on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetr@@ ated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have stood by re@@ bel controlled territories outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants are reli@@ ant on local or by tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
you call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine . however , their food is making them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for this project already for three years and expressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot; in acquain@@ t@@ edness . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families to planting Pl@@ zen , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city , locally @-@ driven fuel consumption is used in plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; production from the regions of Petrograd , &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this managed they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have developed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , mushrooms have distributed throughout the east G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fungus for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fraction of the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by establishing vinegar remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee set , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred men prot@@ ested on October 21st in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that gr@@ asp@@ ed in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government came out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 re@@ bur@@ sts in the north and centrally located regions of the country and approximately 250 millions hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande occurred a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured due to fires .
according to the European for@@ estry system , which monitors the forest land by satellite pictures , are burned alone in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
fully Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ven@@ tiveness and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why civil protection was not in a position to settle the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al by the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages for everything and nothing could be evacu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did not do this nowhere : there are d@@ wel@@ ded reports of open roads that were closed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June as the streets were very late locked . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in oils with a high bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko will be questioned .
a far @-@ wide suggestion about the rolls that the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law requiring the applicant , if the applicant has had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val leads further in the same article by the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly burning wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , gradually spread further on fires of this type .
regarding these problems , the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when resident information was seeking or tried to contact relatives , to contact offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire@@ men and was so decisive in this f@@ ateful weekend in October that the server followed the storm of 400@@ ,000 users , which followed the fires , did not with@@ stand the website more than half a million holes .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years previously had been a fri@@ ghtful civil war between the different Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ term pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother said it then not so , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

CC @-@ 2.0
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the King of Haz@@ ara dominated party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt sin@@ less .
the Taliban were ever closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
several days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found himself back in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his small salary , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish bags with mor@@ tar that were he@@ avier than he himself , to earn their living .
at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we checked n@@ ylon from the open windows so we couldn &apos;t fres@@ her at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food for aid .
it is true that Italy due to relatively high ratings quot@@ as is a sort of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . however , it is true that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are disastrous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Civil Rights Organisation for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a sponsorship center when they have officially placed an application for asylum , which can go on for months after the registration of asylum .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the streets .
so it also erg@@ ing A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ ch@@ ever way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to free themselves from these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in the building industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his total savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ apps limb@@ o .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - one Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans developed companies , including cutting , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to be able to use the social networks , within six months after the successful legis@@ lature &apos;s website , stating their full name as well as their expulsion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of sentence or a rep@@ ay@@ ment of a pen@@ al sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently in the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May passed another request for a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher pen@@ alties for the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law the insul@@ ting of President and government institutions is already tigh@@ tened . however , under the law proposal , such a fact would be punished with prison and money la@@ undering , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law should be passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly freedom has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised Egyptian poli@@ cem@@ an by demonstrating violence against demonstrators opposed to military coup , who led to the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a judgment date .
recently his hear@@ ings was postponed to the 20th of May , because the prison management of human rights groups was failed to put the accused of jail in the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ cane threatens the death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ exposure of such weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempt to murder .
in another case a Criminal Court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary freely . they were indicted for their coverage on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ res@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ af@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , aged 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activ@@ ist to inter@@ ro@@ gated documents
may , Tunisian authorities six hours with the hearing of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been mis@@ led by the President of the Republic , who , according to the Plan , was explicitly supported by the President of the Republic , who , according to the Plan , was explicitly given by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused Am@@ nesty and , provided that all un@@ lawful funds will be returned .
on 21 April , on the 21st of April , published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , casts a light on how the presidential election will look forward to support legislation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the naming of his sources by stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code , which secur@@ es journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the case .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to present their ID ?
according to new provisions of the information office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need social media in China before they write or share messages in social media .
the provisions will also indicate that registration will be necessary with full re@@ pressive names .
analy@@ st suspect that by eliminating anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then we will see you in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may Uni@@ fied the state cens@@ or@@ ship in Russia access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app , we@@ chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ chat , to register in the state government as the &quot; organizer of the information @-@ proliferation . &quot;
this name is part of a law out of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government introduces a list of online services , which allows the &quot; release of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and force it upon request for the suspension of user data .
among these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ p@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail and d@@ use of other services .
tur@@ quoise dish has been Wikipe@@ di@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the statements , Turkey supported the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communications were blocked , the site was blocked because it is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; source of information that works with groups to engage in a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is therefore , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can not stop getting around
following this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased monitoring tools , the internet service provider to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs , which en@@ code data encryption .
the government has bound to t@@ elecom operators and intelligence services , but has other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
