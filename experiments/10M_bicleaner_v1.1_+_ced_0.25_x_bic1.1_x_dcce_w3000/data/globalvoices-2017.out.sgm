<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American films, danced to American music, American authors read and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mostly journalist due to an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pellet's letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magnates with the help of Julia Roberts, who was the Supreme Court with judges who were interested to occupy his interests.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "me it was, as if the absolute truth is, iss everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you are always the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm greeting letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, how he converts with his bottoms up.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, expressed it, and declares publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections was the highest number one had ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this biggie person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to tie in Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Such as my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a profound person, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps worldview is not associated with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met us with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I lived in Sandy Bahr who lives for the environment long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embody values deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump have paved its way to nominate Republican presidential elections, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they either share his racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke my heart almost.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as a segregation.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which most of them are, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remknick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Annom.: as much as" "" "rest against all other ethnicities," "" "word from white in playful on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as Schiddertrauma), as called the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, is nowhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America's promise of this promise, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who like in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud, No! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "brock the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos got a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answer they.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero municipality in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 mileage south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La Banda de Música (music bande) is now played by children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra, which has been a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the village of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"" "" "" "the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and bank violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth so offered a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their obligations to the music group very seriously, means the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come up and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongo and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically located on the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay, capital - on instruments that are manufactured from replacable waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reproduced instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura, where the recycled he began using Favio Chávez in order to transform parts of the case into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, celli, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayischen and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local oil ologist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something which he had never seen before: an made up of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from reconstructed material and called The Modern Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tonnes each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - as the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing battles.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published in Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs under an agreement with Global Voices on the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already been operated in purple waters from illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa looked.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were thus brought up accordingly and little inclined to welcome a legislative breakwater of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they linger to him, one of their ports and refused to give him a fisherman's violin.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that you simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior clerk of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch some fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the plundering of fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, the criminal practices crosses and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegale fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which at that time had driven the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"so we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts' Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is by definition unregulated: what is captured is hidden, absent because of it is extremely difficult to trace. so the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the intentional disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing was once passed through bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail speed, with the information between individual countries, so the actions happen in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries with each other can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships even very attentive when they move on the open sea, with satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the botanical areas. also, so suspects travel routes - about those who suggest that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such surveys can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to pay for numbers as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then a considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The platform that has been created was created to win 20 million USD in lost sales, including the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. under these same illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among these practices, such practices include operations like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indicating of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they specifically use the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-destructive control system," "", "says Long." "" "a ship could not fish and one country could say" "" "you darling my harbour not" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Comm to me'. 'and exactly this legale slip hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in over 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">There has uncovered criminal networks, who had fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found wings.</seg>
<seg id="128">Based on its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into networking crimes," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is supposed to help the FISH-i, suspects ships precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed, will also help to open the illegal ships that hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and this we try to cross through," says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships are now turning their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be ordered from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and means that the position of each individual traceable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who what is doing - this simply gives sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite themselves and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but they are also terrify.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have formerly been exploited without a license and barely reckon with consequences, now they know they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board ship networks whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now also other countries simply copy," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa each year, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, 2015 six countries have joined forces, to the so called West Africa Task Force. they now fight against illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the target to allow even more such initiatives and structures to come into other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member of Somalia could report his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used tuppnets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with taking action against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they tackle illegal fishing events," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proving that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La cuadra there were some rooms that were referred to as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put a man together and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here, their names were changed and they were given a number assigned as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">If they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that it should be laid.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - of euphemism - for the liberation of men and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>

<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things to home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "war mare" - as she called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later in the military, I was in the gendarmerie - I realized that war-mare has a bayonet or perhaps military signs, which one takes an enemy which one has fought.</seg>

<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... stisteals, then that is not a war-mare but vandalism.</seg>

<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could take part in this vagandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officer in gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal, and I said, and thou that thou hast made cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded to anger, smote me and cried out:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and kill you.</seg>
<seg id="283">For this we need no one else!</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor but he still brought clothes with it.</seg>
<seg id="288">Back then, the defense of a co-conspire had been accused of this crime. I disagree, no problem, they can lay down to me what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="300">They could have simply put it into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even families to pass on their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The scramend of the corpse is the last heinous act that one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="348">On a sign the Japanese word on the site that was on the site (coronation sha), the "older car" means, falsified - perhaps even with Böll-witgeous & # 8212; translated as a frightful motorist.</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was published from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">The original photos of Joshua Levine, which was often shared in social media.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture Kyoto apologized for the translation errors. furthermore she stated that the error was already included in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo from Flickr users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overplace you need two important skills: passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language. in general, conviction that translators in the target language - should not be in the initial language - native language.</seg>
<seg id="379">This should be a French native language for example from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as their native tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for the overlation, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers, the Japanese language.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have no foreign employees, make translations nevertheless firing internally. then, the Japanese people, whose English skills are considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Original translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worrens and puzzling phrases that are created by mechanical translations show that this technique may not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling printing prints, which often uses t-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to read or do not understand them.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo from Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation error may be acceptable or acceptable or at least harmless. however, by major companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="394">Also other online broadcasters transferred recordings to Caracas, organized by oppositionists, who resisted Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court was dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author with Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was folded and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="405">Previous postings of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local internet service providers now use DNS users. this is a technique, by which the DNS server will respond to specific domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds or denied the request for such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplayouts</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores is beaten, while he was in police officers.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back to broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections: that way the Venezuelans of gaining access to multimedial reporting about current events in the country is always further complicated.</seg>

<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would learn there again" bad habits. "that's the fact that Alvarenga, belongs to the Indigenous group of the Guarani, would speak to their native language Guarani again.</seg>

<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that anyone who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently agreed to a bill on "the regulations concerning the use and usage of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if he is accepted by Parliament, the user and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law a position would then be set up, which is in charge of providing citizens with a permission to provide social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register with their correct names and personnel numbers, to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could cause a sentence of up to six months in jail or a bill.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six partiality, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "jedwede application, who runs through the internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice, video voice and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should impose the user and users the registration. unclear is the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentarians and sponsors of the legislative process, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and a password 'by the firewall to get the Facebook blocked.</seg>
<seg id="510">That could mean Egypt plans to set a firewall at a national level around Facebook. because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to access information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>

<seg id="514">I strongly oppose the technical capacities and the understanding of every authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, it feels like they can control the physical public and private rooms that could be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, then this means that they will be a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to conduct them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at first in the legislature and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary session." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful, or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military way of mind in the parliament, whose senses are maximised and assured that no different narration is present on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the parliamentarians Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legislative precondition against cyber crime in which a lifelong imprisonment for those who were found guilty of threatening the "public order" and "to protest" to protest. "</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards caused by Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (panthera pardus saxicolor). overall, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey, at risk.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard shows the only remaining robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and the prosperity of ecosystems also depends on that a large predatory is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video therefore places that they have a shot of a big cat at the camera, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, made the progress made in the last six years to reconstruct the life of those who were hit by the "triple catastrophe" in March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a Tsunami and a nuclear accident in Fukushima had sparked the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a typical prefectures in Japan's northeast which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring War of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuated, because the tsunami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even so, the prefecture of Fukushima lived a nuclear accident, already alone there were 160 000 inhabitants left their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report by the Kahoku Shimpo show that the progress has been achieved in the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese reconstruction authority and survey results of those concerned itself.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahou Shimpo paper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutes (of the enclosure of the enclosure of the enclosure of the lie, seasonai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could be found Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still tries to settle six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of homes for periods (on the left, kasetsu juutaku) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergency shelters. more than 75 per cent of evacuated in homes, were converted to final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo paper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, their Pforten to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fisheries management in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation again, only 30 percent of the fisheries management have resumed its operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, have drawn up in the three prefectures of agricultural land in large-scale domicality.</seg>
<seg id="564">"" "" "" "Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima." ""</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear uncase, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares have been destroyed in the Fukushima" "" "nuclear zone" "" "zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered from tourism, but again, Fukushima remains quite beaten.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwates are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. in contrast, only 75 percent can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is harder to enjoy their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish a full picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and under the evacuation. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how her indignant has changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to get more information about the tsunami consciousness of the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for the earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"" "" "" "however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes." ""</seg>
<seg id="575">How it comes to those that had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, atomic incident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, nearly 63 million people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people were killed back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the end of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuated areas who still arrive at Behelfsachausen, older than 50 years. they have to compete with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet other countries who speak a different language, the differences appear first to be larger than the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one realizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we cover topics that often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who recall a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about voice and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The People's Municipality of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban Province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there is no noteworthy in sugars.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were laid in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the yields the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its facilities, until only the rumour of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to be found new.</seg>
<seg id="631">Quite rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resignified and commute daily to the factories that grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-veteran, which is open every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are in the east of the region of the type of sugar fabrication, which have been in use after a long inactive time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds himself exactly that in Mañal I would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry had already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, the inefficiency, lack of administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production rose 1,6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvest has not been any news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbeet industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they were importable to the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"" "from 2017 until 2025 the price of refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report" "" "agricultural perspectives" "" "by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations." ""</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the export export would be around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, feeding of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people got their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane Gregorio Arlée Mañali on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he says as a soldier is known about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeated, "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In front of the first closure of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially authored documents covering only about the parts that would be removed to address the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister managed to approve any decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was transferred and the letters were more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the weed factory two years and was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still in operation of the sugar cane factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth from the First Nations community in Canada are concerned with issues that are important to them. they do so by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then working with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is increasing by the young participants in talks such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance," or whatever it comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the kitsumalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," at the almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women, disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters did not always rule the languages of the First Nations speaking language.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has taken, the refrain from Create is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage of N 'we Jinan is available to the Stanzhe in rewriting, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on to my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you get out of our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as our youth have lost our way in life</seg>

<seg id="720">Customers are looking at this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to making this plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district Kappabashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes that were documented by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic meals are so usually that they are not even closer to them. however, a new trend is turning them into remarkable cell phones and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver Matome released the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on special sale: new with plastic spoilt mobile phones positioned as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>

<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say," "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>

<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone-stick has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handytapes from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the champions and turmoil regularly occurs in statistics. however, these reflect not the scale of the human tragedy, which this battle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drug bosses like El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looking at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprena vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We do not only have to show the faces of those who face the fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading of animal político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never look at violence as normal, no matter what shape it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known about illness and sensorimjournalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures which actually can only come from a textbook for criminals or made of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers), if he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the "heroism" of the perpetrators when going through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it's like they were those who have lost anyone and those who have fear that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are about mere numbers in statistics.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of the people is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "ascending" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to engage in such tragedies when they are not moving and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the main city district." in this she describes how armed crime was pressed for month money from her business until they had destroyed the business not only the business, but also their families apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes back up when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers as well.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will manage or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether wines would solve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the post "The forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the generations of this generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he asks questions like: who cares about the child of a mixed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - Unspeakable for a boy for all life from violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father saw, that was shot by armed men out of a squandering car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders for public safety and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 the Public Prosecution 3103 Morde, this is equivalent to the cut 8.5 morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of thousands who are leaving the organised crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories are living in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprena Vivir Con El Narco" has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades in a simple way.</seg>

<seg id="822">This false copy of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny it not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a petrol trucks found the place of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and thereby devastated. the streets in the region had become a dangerous paths of impact, which were difficult to walk.</seg>

<seg id="828">Official representatives describe a fireball, the dutzing homes, including a movie theaters in the vicinity, which was full of people who are full of world champion.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses waged and salted corpses were dispersed in the streets.</seg>

<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been replaced several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, though, though, not related to tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the Boko Haram villages Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported dryers of atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops have been burnt down and corpse, in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed back to count the corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were broken, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images could display the follow-up time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt to win the Boko Haram, country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was mistaken for the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misleading usage of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures; Africa Check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a testament to mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further brings personal comments like this example, accidentally, the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to delivering arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a review, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, Posts reported as the following that summarized these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab news page, the 2012 were mistaken, the President's Thein being said, monks and politicians could have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the picture from the DR Congo to publish this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that follow these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in the context of the mysteries of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of the Muslims - the deportations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life will be underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion is wanting to understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worthwhile to examine how images can be used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who have unintensely affected the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrows it the actual Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spreading of raptsamer pictures was already debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the return of pictures of an inclination equated to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures readers and audience desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how non-violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, fact is that it is indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. unreplaceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all conflicting stubbornly each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or an expression does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwoteca language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- make you aware of your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrück language spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>

<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the coverage of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported short of another initiative of Steven Bird, the inenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already been conducted since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass window of languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that assume the diversity - secure spaces, in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>

<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storytellers, their devotion and their representation suggests that listening to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth Laughter and Emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou is also taking the opportunity to explain the stories of narrative of stories for their country.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that will be organised in Berlin dedicated to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Head Office produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquisition (the cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that was released last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of approaches which deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in movements for free knowledge, have page on page to look over the fog that surrounds our Newsfeeds and to create something sense from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice which push for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, namely immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporal extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in prison Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of military tribunal from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented herself as a insider of the Assad administration and made aware of an alleged death part against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place and condition remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel has played a crucial role in extending access to the internet and to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologian and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Based cultural prototypes were forward as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS was all about it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syswires but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike in digital archeology and conservation has created a time-capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Ironically, Bassel has not yet finished this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dream of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other detention to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also taught to other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without having to actually held one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a prostitute in the years 2012 till 2015 she wrote to her husband when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year in the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She put the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger against a corruption incident, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is a diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was arrested in 2010 together with four other defendants due to the diversion of 54 million methtikal (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mosambique, whose council did Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called on his reviewing into the company, which happened on 19 April then also.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the Prosecutor's Prosecutor of the Republic, who donated the application, there would be no barriers to Cambaza, re-refer to its old posts since the company does not complete disciplinarming after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated dade Pública, in short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to resume the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also have a lack of disciplinating proceedings against the counter-resistance movement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"" "" "" "however, the company seems to be careful, however and prompted no adequate legal action to apply the appropriate functions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "reluctant" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">When Cambaza were a competent type, he would be counselor after he was sentenced to a sentence and caused half to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and underpin his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to reintegrate into the company that he helped cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Thus it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, Young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director without any morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that the state has already offended so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking to return morals and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only serves themselves by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handele it had become an inexhaustible money of money, and the state itself is weary to this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Diethieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel. Mozambique is not only to be remembered as a first independent president, but also as a sharp, shattering and - next door - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he was energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious man is incapable of all, even the fatherland for its ambitions, to sell his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes the tactics but he does not change its ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information by Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">"" "although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people with East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "" "Indian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or on the enclosure of the site. (in burmesic script) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radicalist movements of the word has given an extreme connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly uses ultra-nationalists as hate speech to Muslims who represent a minority of population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of senseless content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically generated by hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about his use of use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesic words with fundamental meanings which have the same code as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as' Kalar PAE '(splinbse),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post by one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether she knew how he could relieve his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the fragment (la) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There have been different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that it will reduce combative language to radical national nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook analytic must be analytical before it triggers all Posts that are in the suspicion of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook solved the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automation will not understand what you write to Facilook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyse the mail and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "" "(age)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread that hate speech, have received a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminating hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy might not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have demonstrated that the censorship of impact is often a katz- and mouse game, whereby users should simply start social networks, to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts as he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to notify my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and it was prohibited to me the Liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post "" "" Facebook Community standards not corresponded. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts of people who don't have any negative purposes or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical national nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post office without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention of reducing racism in Burma due to their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censor such words will bring only more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they started with no local context or technical support and so words like "throne" or "peycurry" have forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the falsibly deleted Posts.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the adultery, some members of the dualistic and muslious religious communities took place at the practice, and in May 2016, the leaders of the inter-religious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country, told that the state shall not interfere with, since that, age do not determine the maturity.

<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical government of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were eager to manage laws for children's marriage, followed on the base and pleasing his great support. undoubtedly helped them to bring this result.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was sort of tension in this actually complicated thing, and at some point in doubt, whether the opposition would agree with the bill of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update, which posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided before in the Senate, the design can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media-media was enthusiastic, because the laws for children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-Member Lovell Francis, who clothed a ministry in the ministry of Education, said:</seg>

<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we, instead of talking about the discussion so generally, in a way that we would like to invite the state to our bedroom, "simply responding to it that the state, our daughters from before them safeguards that they are possibly used by large, hard-driven men who are faced with them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legal in different gradations or continue to be standard, even though there are laws they are talking.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally approved.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now plunged the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and to share reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series are opposed to the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-versed Internet users are used to use straps tools for blocking websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society where Harvard University has been held, regular blockers of the Internet have been adopted since 2007, following the Internet law (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, there are now several mirrorate sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised Peer-to-Peer-Network (i.e. computer-computer connection), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal ban but is available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger article IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Once we have heard the news (about the block from Wikipedia) we decided to locate Snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the contents in decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step is conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansikloomin.org, a open source project that everyone can use to hoisted similar mirrorate sites if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices members and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack on a different URL that is not the original one. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server leads the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents from Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is run by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around for around, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry on a camera with himself and try to understand the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepas wildlife tries to bring an international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that leads the attention on Nepalese animals.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how he helps him this first-class location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had given a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran into my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began to fold pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not so scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he already stood on face to face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not at bedtime!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buhek appeared. he immediately sits, we see ourselves and he tackled me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I clicked on environmental protection) in his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make at the Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a Content-sharing Convention again.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the greatest care to address the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state of Odisha by a blackout and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a siraternity of relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition her spouse will also not be called by name, is also widespread among men. however, they have far less to fear signs, if at all, what, should they fail to practice this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the Pune, in Maharashtra, joined together nine women, including health professionals, as well as housewives, a unique club and thus became the main council of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the reduction of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the uncovering of practices, such as children's heirat to the exiting of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that showed the Rohini in their discussion, was the women whose spouses do not name their husbands' name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has chosen this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that the women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the name of their husbands are not to be uttered according to their husbands" "", "a Brist, whom they have pleaded not guilty and never questioned." ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman is respected by her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not withstand this is seen as a cunningly, as a woman with no morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband on behalf so far, try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on to his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage Rohini started their first discussionist.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some felt that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the Round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to put discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then they asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pais from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never had to speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had brought only before his whole exercise, another decided to let the whole rugged frustration against him and his family by giving it off.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The term on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an old bread, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands upon their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband's husband called upon Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it in dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she studied, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a Candidate was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the petrol-red spot on the forehead, which shows the divorce.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would wear the cinome red spot if he tasked it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased completely with it, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose himself, not to wear him in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussionslub is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at any Discussion, a trip." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack some lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to make sure who could hear what could hear," "" "says she." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months she celebrated her own birth days with cakes for the first time in her life; she danced and sang about things they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities on our spouses, never said so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only contributed to Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay, but some wanted to carry a salta spa, a wide Hemd over a pants, they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-selection, the morals connected to the Saris and much more, smuggling Rohini into a panel discussion, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months a bit has changed since their first discussion track, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but heard then again to say the name of their husk.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and are not members of the family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two are still saying the name of their husbands'; only one or two women carry out in their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the Discussion-skb know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fetching to find more freedom of movement or their own clothes-selection - at the end of a hard to navigating flow.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declared:</seg>
<seg id="1539">"" "" "" "each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">However, this club also gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the incarnate Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer in its final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion," after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which was required for the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China has described Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and said a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not required to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to call up calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, release or permit him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely absent from the subject.</seg>

<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met in the end of June Chinese official to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman rejected it to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to permit Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway to Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway became Stove after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon heading to China, since exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee put his hope for a unconditional release to express and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his detention, he was not able to counteract his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest, and permit him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius for the release of Lius as they did in an Declaration on 30 June.</seg>

<seg id="1654">The call of the US message passed a furious response from China to Himself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that "no country has the right to turn into an isolated and unresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley dealt with that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">To protect and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they have been entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal systems, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US-Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On June 28th, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum, called on China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP previously that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted Liu with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells the following:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls China to release its international human rights obligations, including free speech, to protect and release the rights of these rights for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called on China in an Declaration on 29 June on Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to make sure Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments that he, regardless of where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news sender of France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, announced the State Department, that there will be no further information whether France will eventually take part.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the Council of Taiwan in Taiwan called on 27 June to allow Liu to release a greater tolerance toward those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The taiwanese Legislative Society of Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick Liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very concerned in a statement on June 28 at Liu, and gave you that many have asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>

<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, led to a harmonic, stable and affluent China, which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or land?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at the international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanghgam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark in the blogosphere has triggered a debate.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the Lawyers Association of the State of New York, the Minister of New York noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody questioned whether new York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, you can say that we are not at least one country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanghgam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what he appeared uninevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, it defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to give Democrats, abandoned logic, since it fits better with their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the final week the Shanghgam were given the answers to his American guests in regard to our press, our Judictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarts it with non-answers and rational ways.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanghgam to make his mind clear as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our precious K Shanghgam will take the trouble to raise this point if he was paid up to be part of the city's government in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing its comment on the blog, he points to the critiques to read the entire co-address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanghgam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the manuscript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said, why the elections in Singapore be so unimportant, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He is in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party to win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "was not a country," "" "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment in Shanghgam, which makes the leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew about Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old wardrobe that expects me - whether I disagree with them or not, but this is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanghgam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes, and become aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review breaks down the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr Shanghgam" "" "has made a mistake by Mr. Shanghgam" "" "or was it a Freudian vocalist?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1721">If not, on which country the sovereign rights of the city Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally urban and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the governance, the statements of Mr. Shanghgam are of heavy importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clear position then mostly the standard rept: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ichockey, nature." many Canadians may cook some inwardly against anger, if they are held for Americans, but me don't bother.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians have a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "cute" has no personality.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band has published a music video, which took the junta and restore power in 2014 and restore the civilian government, despite their promise of restoring the civilian government.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) is the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai policies, inspecial how it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once you have a look at this recording of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persecuted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" possibly refer to the drain section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gave the commander-in-chief of the army, absolute decision-making power on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program to "setting change" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and clear rules are often used by the authorities to oppose activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army was also established, the online content is monitored and people who have thrown, the monarchy is slandered to have prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to persecuted, is their decision expensive U boats to buy, although security professionals they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, even how persons are thrown into a black supply chain, before putting them into an interim camp, another problem fall.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovered very slowly in East-Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abian war has been officially ended, but his scars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the northern borks in Tkuarchal show distinctive pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchiava are located in the carbon basin of Abkasien.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, shutters, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, for the most part Russians and Abhasen live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called Geistercities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, there are still more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011 the total population of the district of 16,000 people, after having risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old of Mexikaners, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillenebell and gold-colored ear-rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Wallachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night can sleep in simple rooms, with cold, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, people come to full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cartons.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want anyone to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and bring them to hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can not pay, they massaged them with a balm that creted away from long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurchin) posiert with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracking.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it fits to it because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hope to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and take direction north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a famous name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitian and the Africans often travel the route and that the Africans speak on Whatsapp of Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as builders at construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket according to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let it go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always keep in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez told that her guests can send their often text messages if they have gone to grate them or to report on the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel by Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family were incorporated in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has stated that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep at blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was subsequently expelled from the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Wallachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to maze money by him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, single-known, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family still lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travellers look quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a major part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she is fed in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair care that her has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, as she asked me shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya" fueron, "they repeat each time." they have been gone. "</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-Point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter-users on the occasion of the creation of the enclosure.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities area in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the phone users received a mobile notification in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi. a mobile notification where it indicates the district government, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, it is said that the app will" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But colònable the authorities also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had already installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the Notification of the police, the app will determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, together with" illegal religious "" "" activities and "" "" harmful information "" "," including videos, images, eBooks and documents. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockade pornography website, from online fraud, Trojan and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filtering for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers could enable the home network of a person to manipulate or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities of this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark ones for those who live in distant countries like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">That on Twitter-based media Outlet "Images from mainland China" (on the outskirts of the enclosure of the site), the censored messages published in China, showed photos from a checkpoint, at the policeman the residents had unchecked, as if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be detained by up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the rest of mountainous technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back to maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "Images from mainland China" "" "(on the outskirts of the enclosure of the site), also published a Jingwang Product description, derives from the fact that the software can lift the password's requirement of a Windows operating system and thus gets full access to the hard disk of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city-party to minimize the proliferation of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and the related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, a US-American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the instruction to all residents and entrepreneurs, to the 1st August their "personal ID cards, mobiles, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police register.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy them. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible benefits, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordal Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + Community, free expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallat Hdaib spends the bulk of his time indoors; sometimes he saddles on his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its coilted lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">"" "" "" "for now six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and asks their altproven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often proceeds with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian people, but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues do not only find in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking by borders, and it can be according to his own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he is opposed to the American foreign policy a particular aversion.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a "Palestinian depleted" of the second generation - so he himself was born, even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own circumstances," "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that because I am a human being" "" "while he poured into water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is foreseen for Muslims from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordal law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancestral traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has a little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the slaughtered hot coffee and the swaths of the cent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially if you have a look to neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From this, it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens made an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamische Action Front - the jordal branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert hall.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The S & D spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which provides an established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordant people as" "" "progressive supporter of human rights" "", "which continued to stand up" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement would probably not simply be simply silken rhetoric, but in fact a clearly reflected reality in Jordan reflecting in Hdaib's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to be Leibe by having his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently lower-down-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "" "" "over the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of" "" "honor" "" "- the inofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch said that the number of Honorary people in 2016 reached their climax; however it is still troubled that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence, to provide adequate consideration.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to fight corruption from the year 1954, women, who are suspended in prison at uncertain time, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee by the family that the woman is not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known also not to shy back from themes which in his country long as tabular.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, he admits his music, which is full of explicit anchorations on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was introduced to politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are in the core are political, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get in his words" "", "what you want" "" "- be faith or non-belief, heterosexuality or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments regarding equality of LGBTQ + -individuals were still strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online programme Roya to note later that his comments were ripped from the context and was censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a working copy," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib buys open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in mind today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuts who later should work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why could Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemitish Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government has sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordal Intelligence service took place several former governmental bodies and members of the association, with the grounds, they would have expressed critical on comments in social media critical about the problems that are rooted in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs's opinion is that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural upheaval in the next generation of the Jordan paper.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has passed for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it is like Hdaib - consists of slow, depresses and inwary changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordal society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region with the help of music, art and literature is becoming a real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading uniforms and in artificial Art. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will resign and consequently also resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that there is a variant of Tanabata festivals is celebrated for usually also in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory implies that the rams, the drums and dancing over more than one thousand years have been delivered, in the armies from the west of Japan to marched in the Northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to force in his knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>

<seg id="2157">I saw this for a long time again the Meguro Gajoen: two festivals are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and thus a stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where streetb and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to that more and more civilised among the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other to show who can create the most eccentric Looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to maintain their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get training in the hairstyle of hair that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the bidder opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "love message of guerrilla warfare," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The entry is published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love notes to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel forced to carry out affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out of the two young Colombian activists from the foundation of Bogota and Cristian Palacios, by the Young Youth Youth Foundation, and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Rev. liación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write letters to guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their land was the place of a historic event, and they wanted to help her part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombian), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signatories of the peace contract as such significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos for his merits was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But a long way ahead of the Colombian is still a long way until one can talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, subjected to war rhetoric and bore their arms around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, who had accustomed themselves to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, it must now take up into its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian should join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla war that will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation emerged at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk about Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this declared that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love notes, but those forget that they need much unnecessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans, he told him further, this year he told his love with people who was most urgent.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now the campaign was collected more than 2000 letters.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo, hosted by the Foundation Bogotart, in the camp to transmit the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to counteract the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of undermining people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former combatants led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a type of hut, in which the guerrilla warfare, I saw an guerrilla war that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to accept, because beside him on the bed lay a MGL-pomegrance, a deadly weapon in the crochet.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke to him and asked:" "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter that somebody has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life somebody has written something so nice, so I will answer it. suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him very well and sat down alongside the pomegrance.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Maybe he was tired too, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers from hunger. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">The prelude came together and some leaders of the FARC to a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students grew up all grown up as already war and the FARC already appeared in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views about the peace process: "many years have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state have responded to the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the company in this country more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this scale, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never been hearing and had no election law, and to realize that people, whom I have often seen as a monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment were very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbianern was reputed that after drafting peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack the weapons, rise up and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, did someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen's friends, with the following message: "then there are no men more in Chechnya who can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos taken from my documents by the very WhatsApp took the lap.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was right there, I heard a couple of shopping from my car's back home, I heard a men's vote:" "" "here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I revolved, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt anything.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard one sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long will you dishonate the family, you scanded?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I know only that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and the last analysis in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyfaded in my right-wing's wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which health wings were you placed - in the men or women of women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name drauf; but the doctor did understand and lay me among the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with the fear; it was a muslious, a caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going up without the streets; others wanted me to come in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that everything was just evil, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have basking size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only your family, but the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car was covered with dark windows and a hash plate with a 95 drunken.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Once it happened for the third time, I realized that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friends checked the numbering plates - it turned out that I was followed.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you buy?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activist activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Out of security reasons I don't want to reveal their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the land, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without sign me, without comming, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I disrupted my old SIM card and cast them into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came on and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe, you would be sure in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you steckar. you even know your number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you, it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "however, we do not talk about the gender equality, but this is a tabular issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still traded some traditional caucasian elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome these spiritual barriers.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to see how the person uncover, that they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who made an hour and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the month of Ramadan there were no human being arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait for, and he did not closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "" "" "for my I, they probably load the relatives, these take care of the problem with the concerned person and in the end we are calling for an evidence that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "experienced by blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now a gay men are held in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there were just not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all those who have no wealthy relatives, or those who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that you can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say:" "" "should they be converted, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">To understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, but rather submerged in order to radicalize.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been no news of them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have just taken them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was even when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as a banker so far there were no reports until now. but we suspect such actions are indeed possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"" "do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" "" "nontraditional" "" "orientation already in the past?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I loved my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known to Grosny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally wanted to bring us to the "Civil ization" but ultimately has taken us back to the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were silenced; I had colored eyelashes, wearing rohrenjeans and short troops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of sharia has never been bent over me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people met like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it: they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "" "" sock does not say about the misfortune of another. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if that make themselves fun over sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just did their eyes shut up in front of you because they believed you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace keep up?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister 2005, he began to speak on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but above the conduct of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had previously smiled and yellow, regarded you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could sense how the situation in the Republic constantly swallowed.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I have not earned a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Besides that, I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, meetings, I begged them to hospital and help them to get Essentifs.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not penny for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves, when I cursed them.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is alold.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature, that has purely nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Cheetschenen, who want to prophesied with foam in front of the mouth that there are no wings in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestians have who have the Cabal, who have the Russians, and all the planets there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it is unpleasant for me to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here are so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practising Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan - living with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about Transidentity to men who love men and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a trustee.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it's the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I am sorry that I will be here as personal, but my last intimate relationship is already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27th remarked the distressed situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he dwelt in Al-Thawra in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness that can count the inability for his family, such as Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahmaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube gave the moments after it had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to clear the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahmaz.</seg>

<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers who felt helpless and incapable due to the persecution of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable to feed their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region where most of the Arab ancestors living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In the beginning of a century, Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took over power and undertook great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahmaz region, there are some of the largest in-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most sought-reaching and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and hardships.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs systematically employment in local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of dams built, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to exacerbate the devastation caused in the region and to destroy local farming as well as fishing and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arabic Ahawzi youths now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director-Director for Co-operation, Work and Social Welfare, signalled that 5% of the Ahwazis, who seek a job, completed the elementary school, finished 55% a further school and have 45% university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through thought, scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be feminists and why we generally ought to be the feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women are in a flat blanket sooner or later in various fields of life, and that discrimination can still move across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am twice and three, including.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I'm talking on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black transients, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from Diaspora, if I mention, on which species we have been physically, spiritual and verbal, have to mention both in and outside of feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to uplift "their voices, and" Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing, "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, an institutionalised form is an institutionalised form of violence, which we are exposed to black women on two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in addition, black women and women of other ethnicities and origin cities less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girl with a migration background more often the school is referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are subjected to a higher risk of suffering and women with a migration background, domestic violence and violence in a partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people with no skin colour. on the other hand I can't join me as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands, refuses to consider injustices in their thinking that relate to the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am depleted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner said 1851 in their speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a incarnate and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorbing our customs and customs, in order to advance its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer seek to give white women the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to worship them of a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">"" "although the intersectional Feminism was established in order to give women of different schools and diverge themselves from the white feminism, is still the word" "" "feminism" "" "in its name." ""</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to detach me full of feminism and join me to the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than being insistent for a white-feminist paradigm which is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark on the spheres, which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book African Maromanism: how we can conquer ourselves, that we can defend ourselves upon our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a blurred environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being's one as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women report at all once, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men who are suspicible. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported at all with the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 punches and Statistical 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system, which is nothing lower-3 of Paraguay laws: good approach, deficient rackdowns and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are genuinely misleading, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports, but not even ansing the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the District Court Prosecutor 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peacekeeping sector. here, 86% of the indicators came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically challenged, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics indicate not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to data of the paraguayischen's ministerial Minister Ana Baiardi, few of these offences are actually displayed. "on any woman who refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who are refunded because of physical failure, come two women who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not a criminal offences, law enforcement authorities can not adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone up to August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay up to every ten days a woman is killed by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all of her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't really want it, but then after. this was supposed to repent it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier about it, I always thought that only women are going to be subjection, because they are deceived themselves by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never ever happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked the rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of failure have at least had some compassion to blame for it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner has her mistress.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo, CREO (" "" "I think" "" ") that consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with a psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads among the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against their former partners who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly about money, power, and influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayischen Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Poridra (# Fürth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law considers to be explained to a standardised criminal, and to punish harder, as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the draft text was altered in some points in order to also win the MEPs for the law that feared that the path for decriminalisation of abortions is being forbidden, which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill was intended to cost the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedures that have to bear the victims of violence in the present time, if they simply want to report, and want to receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echoauri argues that law is not effective if the legislator does not provide sufficient financial means to this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay it is seen as part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a change must take place, so that violence is no longer considered to be accepted.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law were changed, but among other things a passage was cancelled, which had called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is an increasing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for treatment on-site medical research: for instance, a lack of healthcare and vaccines have a lack of medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious in the poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, at building own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrior is Director of the Central Reservation at the Centre for research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrior discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media on this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrior speaks as an individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the samic National Programme for Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also started developing a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers rather than being makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It's difficult to find people who want to go back or here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it cost a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, Big Data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the easy access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has already taught a salad for the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outlet's, the first plant, which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was placed only by his own ingenuity and the question how many salads he can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented, so that he could not use it on breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">Patents stand not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or grassroots or weed leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been filed on more plants such as grain or cartels. due to these trends plant-breeding, environmentalists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton still lacks salad, but he now needs a longer time since his work is always worth more and more constraints.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they withstand to court, no one can breed any new lettubs, because all the features are patented. "he is doing so good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather that the movement from the IT field would come and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open-Source "-seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software that provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to make sure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders can pledge that others may use the seeds to use them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds, and sell it. "open source" breeders simply allow others who are able to buy seeds, to breed as their own varieties, and it is not immediately exorbiting - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patents or prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seeds companies have already joined forces in 2014 since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds said to him a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to not use the latter or only little by raising seeds with natural resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "Open-Source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified crops." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically altered or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to purchase our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the development of chemicals and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which in August or September 2016, should also know that the way in which the vegetables are bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritional soups without seed estates is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to provide others with seeds to provide other seeds. in this way, its approach is patent-related, unlike seeds, seeds and plant-features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered since the available gene pool due to the ever-growing intellectual property rights on plant material, which thus becomes increasingly more restrictive, is incessantly shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartels as intellectual property is protected, making it possible for plant breeders either not or only usable.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-thin plants such as wheat are patented in a larger style as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated as they have targeted characteristics - of such, by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they withstand in certain environments, and threats like pests and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeder by more and more patents decreases. genetic variety is currently unnecessary than ever before, as the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman in Cearly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activity. with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company has established itself for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it considers that intellectual property restricts other breeders" "", "" "" "patents and the protection of plant versions innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everybody can follow, as soon as the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection is not inhibited innovation, i.e. innovation not, but promotes the public to provide more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other thing: 20 years to wait, until a patent has been consumed, there is certainly no innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general well and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetaries incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will make us impossible if we can not continue using the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">A total of Morton has interfered with the concept of itself, plant-characteristics: "we do not really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breed a variety, chastise his own values in them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for their cultivation mass-wise herbicides, the chastiest in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just structured." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are patents, create it most smaller seed companies, even without patents, they either reject the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "again, the Egyptian authorities still locks content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of May 5, the Egyptian government piled the website of the Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above all-mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">To defend the Network for Human Rights Information, despite this attack and the constitution by the authorities, which the law ought to defend, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as it is now. ANHRI confirmed that all the technical possibilities must be exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to imitate. we insist on it to continue to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, following the official news page MADA Masr, Arab-language issue of the Huffington Post and that from Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site releases for the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI is also based on the blog of the columnist and human rights research Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada uses his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he does not write to Egypt websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog was he taught to circumvent the censors of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, which is located on the site of Ziadas blog, on the other hand, continues to be accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, as the police criticised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada came to the block by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to block is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfatal-Sisi; and even if the blockage of the blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to give me the sense of a siege; an arrest, an attempt of murder, subloading at the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to get the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mutigen go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this produces technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the block from suppliers through the bypassing of internettle and private browsing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noted how the blocking of websites, the VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally saddened by the fact that the censors are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, using which it can address the court against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day by day newspaper in Brazil with grim headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of a number of postcard theme.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old" "", "" "" "Everyone second day will be assassinated a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and lupin in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation the rule of violence in Rio has reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice had even called the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For detailed reporting of violence in Rio-known newspaper "Extra, on 16 August, editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual interrupting, etc. everything, however, from the civilised standard, and what happens only in Rio, will call in the section "War in Rio" (...) This is our way of call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to us as journalists not close our eyes to the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper explained that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist der newspaper declares that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that war discourse when it is distorted, even if it can be used to distract atrocities and then questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">"" "" "" "but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners." ""</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than it is useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argumargues the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the contrary, call the violence as a "war." this is according to a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for the police to account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military units in Rio itself has shown - in combination with inadequate investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the federal state Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, which, like Cecília, has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">To these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a massive police investigations into a Favela and permanently to stationary a unit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this was actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP, after several reports on Ships and repressions against the poor communities, which should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under blame.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux taken from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name of "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio has also been serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this is calling for the state to use means and ways which are typical of a war. to this end, penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civil war is an indiscerned point in the countryside and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "clefied bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War on or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police clamped the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho, to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have stood by rebel controlled territories outside of Damascus, which led to the fact that inhabitants are reliant on local or by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counterpart, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta, how they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">You call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the conventional, in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of Syrian cuisine. however, their food is making them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred men protested on October 21st in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that grasped in the north of Portugal last week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government came out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires also registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 rebursts in the north and centrally located regions of the country and approximately 250 millions hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, Pedrógão Grande occurred a similar tragedy where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured due to fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry system, which monitors the forest land by satellite pictures, are burned alone in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better preventiveness and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">The people asked why civil protection was not in a position to settle the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral by the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, streets and villages for everything and nothing could be evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this nowhere: there are dwelded reports of open roads that were closed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy could happen as in June as the streets were very late locked. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits in oils with a high brandrisiko will be questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-wide suggestion about the rolls that the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law requiring the applicant, if the applicant has had a means of self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval leads further in the same article by the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus made aware that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of slightly burning wood, as in a vicious circle, gradually spread further on fires of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2855">Regarding these problems, the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when resident information was seeking or tried to contact relatives, to contact offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of firemen and was so decisive in this fateful weekend in October that the server followed the storm of 400,000 users, which followed the fires, did not withstand the website more than half a million holes.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years previously had been a frightful civil war between the different Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-term pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At this time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central afghanistan, for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother said it then not so, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the King of Hazara dominated party Eb-e-Wahdat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt sinless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban were ever closer to their hatred for the Hazara-known Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Several days after his escape Asharaf found himself back in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a coherence. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small salary, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and sluggish bags with mortar that were heavier than he himself, to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite, which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we checked nylon from the open windows so we couldn't fresher at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and strangled on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application Asharaf 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf obhomeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church who distributed twice a day of food for aid.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy due to relatively high ratings quotas is a sort of second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions, the asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the Civil Rights Organisation for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffering from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "it is an improvised equipment in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a sponsorship center when they have officially placed an application for asylum, which can go on for months after the registration of asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it also erging Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepreschever way of life helped Asharaf to free themselves from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the building industry, Asharaf made his total savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schnapps limbo.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - one Hazara in Italy") of director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Lots of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of the Afghans developed companies, including cutting, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience in which the waiter and the kitchen staff were largely refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu is told by the various afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs aims to reach far beyond the Italian Gastronomy and the retail, and aim to the country that he had to leave regenerously as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer.</seg>
