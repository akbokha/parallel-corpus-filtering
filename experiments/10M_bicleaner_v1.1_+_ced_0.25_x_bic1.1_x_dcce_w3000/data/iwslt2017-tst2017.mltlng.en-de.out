this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectac@@ ularly released , that the NSA have heard illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a catastrop@@ hic US intelligence service in which the CIA is literally dra@@ gged dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and prompted it to call its alleged sources .
in this train he became a symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists .
according to the first constitutional order , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get these information and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the mu@@ d@@ tigen that they disclose .
so when the government was ank@@ ank@@ le , he did something , what many courageous journalists had already done before him , he refused , and said that he would rather go into prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then just days before the process , something happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been informed for years that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cr@@ acks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters can always hide themselves less .
instead of failing and cr@@ isen on the statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his telephone calls are secretly concerned ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit cards , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers at his time , but instead the judiciary has put more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this one can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of having a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers into a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more possibilities to comp@@ ose all .
but just as technology has allowed the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the after@@ ward , in the testimony .
today there are communication software that still didn &apos;t exist when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source code for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which was developed by us Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today released by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with every ordinary contact form .
these will be encrypted and stored on a server , which only the respective news agency will have access .
so the government cannot obtain any more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new es@@ pi@@ onage technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders like Edward Snowden have a chance to make mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers .
who wants to tell about abnormalities in the care of soldiers and reported from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental company , the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history has been published ( &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; ) &#91; which means &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness by a statement . &#93; this week we were hosted by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ elle Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers can go to companies such as Mos@@ a@@ unch Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you establish it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
also there are reports that an ally of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ Assad has in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children &apos;s after@@ no@@ ons , a famous cell@@ ists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of a agency &apos;s or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address this ?
but the truth is , when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets into tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians about how secret tax hav@@ ens are to be used by some few to hide and disgu@@ sting their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very confusing and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ che .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for pro@@ secu@@ tions and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans before , who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
however , through the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a dat@@ le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some U.S. countries to provide less information to create a company as a reference ID .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school bor@@ ou@@ ghs to gam@@ ble school children .
it has frau@@ ds allowed to rip particularly respectable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a co@@ vert investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African ministers , who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that all of us could make suggestions on an attorney &apos;s lawyer , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre @-@ meetings . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course he was given to no money in doing so . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has submitted proposals to our secret inquiries .
it is not about a single peak , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make these kinds of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this might sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a safe optim@@ ist , I really see that a lot has begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen more transparency towards more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has gathered at the national reg@@ isters at the national level , who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind a head@@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up by law to end this type of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story as I once almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das would be landed .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ pot .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
must I offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ ar !
this is a small trunk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air mattresses . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what did I get broken down there ?
a game @-@ alien in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , went on ti@@ p@@ toes at the door , and my sleep door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to lodge people on my air mattresses , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ad , my room@@ mate is drawn and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it to be afraid to transform it into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something about it . our apartment will be a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded as &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests allowed us to sleep for 20 dollar on the air mattresses on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I passed .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
my former fellow @-@ inhabit@@ ant , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
thus we presented ourselves to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a site where people publicly post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms , whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but it is not .
nobody who is still quite con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you see on the things that you can see . we could be desig@@ ne .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust , between people who had never met before .
can design so make a difference ?
is it possible to create trust with design trust ?
I would like to give you a precious sample , which degree can we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your compression @-@ zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your remote cell phone to your left seat .
this silent approach of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only so , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you proclaim on Twitter that he is working for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we changed a little detail at this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had only presented himself with his name ; if he tells us wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children mean ?
imagine , you would have 150 jud@@ gements , all of them say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens the trust crucial .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to submit negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their orders , before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and hometown .
little surprisingly we trust the people most , who are most similar .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social prec@@ urs@@ or .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but it has more than ten , is changing everything .
a good reputation is common@@ alities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are in price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell us too little , for example &quot; hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell me a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted sooner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; t@@ olle art@@ works in your home ! I &apos;m making vacation with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to restore this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
what we did not expect , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was not covered before .
for us the business is just very good .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have allowed un@@ authorised parties or dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on behalf of the customer service . all calls came straight to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts me if I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , from 123 million people had only a fraction ever had a problem .
because people are familiar to each other .
when trust works , there can be mirac@@ ulous arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to attack heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real protective par@@ agus that can save lives , even though they do not know them properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a B@@ yp@@ ass .
because they do not want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they leave a even longer stay , without charge extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
thus , of course , not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money @-@ operation are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share .
when I stum@@ bled about this term I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not just . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Share economy describes a trade , human relationships promises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people put a part of yourself open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
but what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits , a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show one in a pub @-@ pent@@ ine neighborhood you have never heard before ;
or when you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to share it together ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of sol@@ itude and isolation .
South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul has already begun this project . many parking spaces , which were included in the government ,
have now been offered to residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were taught to people whose children were pulled out . there were incub@@ ators programmes ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , tonight 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be visiting a foreig@@ ner or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality , there were also previously .
there have been similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find that amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I don &apos;t have to think any time when a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I ask myself why we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed , a brain @-@ washing , is a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
most of the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ master -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am both intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ ower @-@ gym @-@ fan@@ atics in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual p@@ lim@@ ine .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I chose this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homo@@ sexual man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I chose the hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you sup@@ pressed for yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the som@@ ber was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , namely opposite the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of Rhyth@@ m leaves me sometimes to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone percei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like .
later I married and began like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then there was a horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had turned to an end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ der . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ ears from the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock quickly changed into revol@@ t .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; T@@ bom@@ bed Mak@@ ing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
it is not only my country attacked but on the N@@ u kind@@ led me the deeds of others of a citizen in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building with it .
I remember as we drove off -- so deep it went into my seat , and I first feared to be seen as Mus@@ lim@@ ine .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vigil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in well lighted areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ pled you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then Friday was held this week -- the day when Muslims gather to the Be@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the complete reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I heard also of attack upon Muslims or people who held for Muslims led to the outdoors .
there were really bran@@ ges on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have taken the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves to himself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and exclude mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor one removes as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all the other Americans , not a tumor in the U.S. , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , pro@@ sth@@ and and Olympi@@ oni@@ ons .
will the shut@@ down of Mo@@ ze@@ en America make safer ?
there may be perhaps some parking fre@@ eing , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you will be radic@@ alised in your cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
the radic@@ alization process has observed that it begins online . as a result , the person is cut off from their assembly , even by their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or of faith .
when we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Mus@@ lim@@ ine , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,@@ 6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons for their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , it is not driving what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . each Spirit , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring it only in trouble .
nothing inspired and something that had given birth to her anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extremis@@ ts that you spoke a solution .
this Ima@@ m made the connection to God and her church back .
instead of using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept before joining the IS .
it was an insight like the Islam@@ ophobia and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we accept rather an authorit@@ arian governmental system , conformity and Pre@@ judi@@ ce .
a study reveals : if you have examined testing messages , in which negative over Muslims have been reported , it would vote more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation the public to eradic@@ ate the foundation of free society that has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear ends us all .
in the assignment of collective blame , it is not just about to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said ,
&quot; when did such a young man come from my Brotherhood ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ or that was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted expressions by Muslims on his fac@@ ebook @-@ page .
he took eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or we remained safe at home ?
we aw@@ aken it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave our children , one that would control us through fear , or one where we can control our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove up , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , drew my shoes off , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , not to attack us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ced .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go on number ?
or you will join those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you .
thanks nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what you say those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a den@@ ker@@ in with a deep @-@ walk , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say do not fool you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest study done to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people appear like an exception to rule , then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental surveillance , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is possible in research institutions around the world .
before air @-@ parcel in@@ filtr@@ ate into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air machines in the Fra@@ c Centre built live in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting modes , aircraft can reach high speed and acceleration in the nar@@ ro@@ genic room .
they can also build self @-@ constantly lo@@ ad@@ able structures .
you have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it needs to be collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a offsprings of our lab@@ s .
there are no external cameras .
each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in space , to determine comp@@ ut@@ ations on board , what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands gives it on the highest flat@@ ness . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
an airplane that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great benefits at starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a restriction of har@@ ness rigid is that it is sensitive to turbul@@ ence as wind bows .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in what location the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often present ourselves basic abstract issues that exist at the heart of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mov@@ ables for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you .
two decades ago , educated aircraft were able to fly remot@@ ely , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a ho@@ beam .
unfortunately , we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the mon@@ e@@ internal , the mechanical easiest @-@ powered car device . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller ,
no frac@@ tures , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ation or chec@@ kers , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior very much , so that it can fly stable and move in the room .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I must throw it right correctly .
the chance to throw it right correctly , if all watch , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the Mon@@ bu@@ ff is an exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the omni@@ op@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ists , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that it is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result he will receive the decent ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction he is filmed or even as he is rotating .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda .
some is adjustable in models , the rest is getting directly from the fly .
let &apos;s see that there .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller cars .
this is spinning in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when they build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , something sho@@ ot@@ ting -- an engine or prop@@ eller is falling out , the electronics or a cordless - the machine can further fly if limited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will now demonstrate , by doing half of the aircraft .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of esthe@@ tic expression .
we took wholesale Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to take a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us there is the salary in the development and the creation of creation .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such spectacular ways .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very distant galaxy , two black holes are getting faster , you turned , so the mass of Tri@@ er probe in a ten@@ ths of pure energy around .
this short moment they s@@ lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy put them in the form of light --
we speak finally from black holes .
the entire energy has been given into space @-@ time , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
arrange the events first time .
1,3 billion years ago was barely created several zel@@ liges
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet .
a group of especially courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss decided by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people realized it as a crazy genius , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ om@@ eters - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LIG@@ O could be substantially increased , which improved recognition performance tremend@@ ously .
therefore , you are now called Advanced LIG@@ O .
in early September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a final test run to clear some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth through .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that which I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist am MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O mess@@ able signals . what are vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ se in the fabric of space and time .
while passing the wave , the room and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stretched into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often perform a proper dance .
&quot; stretch and reservoir , stretch and storage . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us has stretched out the waves and stu@@ ffed up . el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LIG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , the length would have to be measured by less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are glo@@ omy , and with the support of the public there will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott claims that LIG@@ O is more than an eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you by several points .
in tones this is different .
audi@@ ble notes have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that would mean you particularly much :
about the face of your child about .
instead we listen to certain properties like tape and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she breaks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make any simple images of objects in the universe .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least are for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally speak the universe .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , cir@@ pen simple : w@@ up@@ p !
rot@@ ate the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ pen with an additional key change . this sounds like : Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
it is a kind of movement @-@ type , shapes into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard LIG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; Yemen and who knows what he must hear , recognize this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rod of your mix@@ er .
AA : let &apos;s think of what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 balls , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ nen , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
therein lies the enduring significance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O eb@@ net a completely new way to investigate the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars in super nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the space .
the exciting physical processes occur however in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never go through , since these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were transpar@@ ently glass . the Ur@@ bino : I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the pri@@ x is obs@@ cured by his own descend@@ ents .
using vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am FEEL@@ ING that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we can only discover by listening .
in fact , LIG@@ O found equal in the first attempt of things that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that produces black holes as LIG@@ O they are observed are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . black holes are the Sau@@ cer for our archaeological work .
LIG@@ O gives us a completely different view of the events in space , to the origin of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories in Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before I feared me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if I made me nervous in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just what I feared , I removed my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , on an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guess , I need milk for my beak @-@ whales . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
that yes was the beginning
a new attitude of life in my family . from there I s@@ nat@@ ured to play with them whenever you ask me to do it . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I &apos;ll always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Y@@ ES &quot; had saved my career with my children .
I have a genuine dream job .
I am author . I think things out , do you think of life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ed TV . I mean television .
I am doing television , in a big style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not existed before .
the budget for an episode of a television broadcast@@ er can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days once four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars of television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series will run on Thursday night .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still above . I need to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , around the world burn .
do you know who that is still doing ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with this .
I say to it , because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I &apos;m talking about work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just talk on the computer and imagination , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not working with a dre@@ ary job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it &apos;s like I set up troops as m@@ old I on a canvas .
this is how you set a high sound , lying a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and maternal , cruel and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on it .
many people take when I declare them the bu@@ zz , that I talk to me that writing me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working with television production , when I began working and working , to build and work together , I discovered this matter , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sums are light and air .
the bu@@ zz is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t seek anything other than according to size .
the feeling not to be able to strive differently than according to size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I did not do the failure , and I just know I love the tot@@ ality .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casting limits , the more work there are , the more work simultaneously , the more watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I monkey , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stops .
revised , over@@ claimed , exaggerated , hidden .
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work@@ bench .
Har@@ per tells people , &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; guess , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard .
the volume of the engine is pet@@ rol .
I loved my job no more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my sums were broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , edited weekends , no re@@ mor@@ als , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan asleep not , gives not up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sums I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you from , blu@@ ff@@ der author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you are doing it , you do , one loves to be a teacher , a banker to be a mother and knows how the sums it feels when you knew the bu@@ zz , if the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out to the outside , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , when two things are going to be aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she does not called me &quot; guess . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happened ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my tot@@ als , and here everything is changing before my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters encounter it , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the sw@@ amp , I can do nothing but to fit .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land , which I monkey , the marathon , I run , the army , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id sounds , delicate voices , wa@@ ist sti@@ ckers and the song in which it goes to letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Age . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost will come in .
and that not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we forget .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the titan@@ ium area , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums it .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real money is dependent on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the desire of life .
the real tot@@ als is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the corresponding tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is the voice of God in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , a lot more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this rule , so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the money again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not surprising to me as they work .
the truth does hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work as home .
this entry is painful , because what a person does not work than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we relaxed in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we dis@@ bur@@ sting Sei@@ fen@@ cing en .
but I feel predominantly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused .
I am always looking for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how you live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with the games ?
you can also say it ! if you want to play with you always Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you probably have the right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they like that they want something else to do .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ et@@ le or K@@ eks replaced me .
and she talks about my teenage daughter , all 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids will be ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my comfor@@ ting , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is considered to feel the bu@@ zz , a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and preserve it .
I am not perfect in it . I know and I see . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan at training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not have a full 15 minute treat ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz went back in my free time . the sums appear to return if I do not work .
working is not working without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . she gives me new ideas . I use it to my ful@@ lest and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
silk infl@@ atable and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is me schn@@ apps that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and nevertheless I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my teeth are still burning .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land , which I go monkey , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , smile , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I bet you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dre@@ ad@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical actions .
they have certainly heard of one of the best known , the &quot; cruci@@ fixi@@ on stimulation . &quot; thereby im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain , in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological feature improves .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
however , N@@ uro @-@ healing does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading upper doctor and worked day and night in an emergency .
often I gave patients with sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain mat@@ lt and the sk@@ ull pressure increases .
to save life , you have to decrease the sk@@ ull pressure .
to do this , one sometimes need to remove a portion of ben@@ evol@@ ent brain .
instead of taking the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist who analy@@ zes the brain .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a gun powder , is comparable with very small children that can be taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed to run Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , in@@ mature cells .
maybe you know yet from bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Learning , that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into every cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass inside the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells had changed differently .
they slowly spread and after a few weeks they died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but had changed differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our big @-@ stags cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why are they aware of us ?
we do not know .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain pieces from non @-@ speaking areas and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently highlight color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we pl@@ agu@@ ed them at the discovery of the same individual .
we call the self @-@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ l@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we pl@@ ast@@ ed these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pl@@ ast@@ ed the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with ape .
in the first scenario , we pl@@ ung@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks it was completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we created an injury to and r@@ hy@@ ru@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they washed up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were r@@ hy@@ ru@@ ed .
the evidence that they show are these little points . these are the cells we col@@ ds in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we designed monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pel@@ lets from a tray .
they did that very well .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we had the Mobile@@ mot@@ orization range in the motor@@ ic Cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen with people , they recover spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plasti@@ que brain mechanisms . they will recover to some degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were sure that the h@@ ack had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand they see the monkeys that recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as accurate and not as fast .
now , see when we pl@@ ast@@ ed the cells : the same no@@ ds , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can use them free@@ ze and later use .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in human beings .
I really hope I can show you how the human brain gives the means to heal themselves .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future , how many years will it take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it permit us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already takes a long time to select the patients using treatments and evaluate whether it &apos;s useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric trial .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural .
we do not see democracy as the breaking plant that is in reality , but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changing ge@@ y@@ ness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ es with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece .
at this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ disputed friends told me that democracy would be abolished if something would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you to believe together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group , we could save democracy , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies will be ham@@ pered , our future dark and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the topic of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threatens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . they know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the forgiveness of debt ,
but few recognize his Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , is one of too anxious to invest it there , where it would be productive and income which could be able to carry out the mountain mountain and also produce all the things which the human race is urgently needed , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , in England and in the euro area , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which had been around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father who could not invest in which they would not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who would be afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow ,
un@@ seas@@ oned the circumstances led to the fact that oils kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
his exce@@ ed@@ ingly wast@@ e@@ ful Art All the un@@ productive capital was to be used to develop our lives , develop human talents , and especially to finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
I think , but before we continue , what do we understand of democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the society form , where the outdoors and the poor control the government as a majority .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed to many of them --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to make the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these conclusions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that they were the labor@@ ing poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech , but more importantly , and crucial that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same bal@@ ancing in matters of state rod .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept long --
like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly hidden .
however , our current liberal democracies have not its roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens , and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our present democracies has existed since the time that this separation of politics and the economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , as the economy is gradually mig@@ rated to politics and depri@@ ved them .
wonder why the politicians are no longer like they used to be ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you cannot be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power of politics is emig@@ rated to the economy and separate the areas .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es which sustain@@ s so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy which is so far @-@ balanced by the economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political estates is increasing , the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; control reserves , just as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t work very well .
the lesson from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is one solution : the working arms is emerging ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ aut through automation and robot .
the problem is , so long economics and politics are separate areas , the autom@@ ating the twin summit will be higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the economy and politics and make sure that we are more democratic in a unified field , otherwise we end the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; which is solved in the machines and put human energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians , &quot; ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the sense of life .
I believe we must be optimistic .
so what hur@@ ts it , how could it look to have this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is followed by a job of the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all incomes come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated .
there is no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ surge at the twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : please just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the twenty @-@ largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire trade of trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the surplus surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are scar@@ ce .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world that I describe will is at the same time liber@@ alism , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because she will bury the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ , global Key@@ n@@ esi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a genuine democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ les ?
the answer depends on how we decide to work together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you described you in your biography yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the reunion of politics and economics is ... Do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggre@@ gate demand , which indicates Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely enter@@ o@@ dly .
BG : actually , and now we are at ease .
Y@@ V : if you are not a wir@@ r , one does not think enough .
BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said this . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you hold from the viewpoint of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain way , if I must say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles today the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ al , as John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what the democratic development concerns .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of violence to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners curious about your experiences as Minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say goodbye to the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the perpet@@ ual denial that a massive distor@@ tion to the euro area ran , and continues to massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal to deny that denial --
it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to be the denial .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you are trying to preserve an economic system that is not viable through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism into life , it will perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you think ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or anyone who , after 6 months in office , particularly in such a tense situation , claiming that he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course , I made mistakes .
the major error was to mark the application to extend the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the back@@ ers to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that proce@@ eded by the eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that it had been a catastrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s creditors , which has imposed us this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ c mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : in spite of all that , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is affected by someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survi@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , they will be demon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be demon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not be catastrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
when we permit ourselves to beat the path of post @-@ modern 1930 , which it seems to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of the Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much for you at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of you have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 mid @-@ term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
that &apos;s going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leit@@ ner at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a clock and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for giving the shows and the content to the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are all right at this corner .
this curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV shows on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
your show will be rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive , where , after getting a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at that end , shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you have already need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts on the medium term , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t am@@ a@@ ze .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and el@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where everyone can view each free of charge .
and if Amazon exists for nothing , it is possible to go correctly ?
millions of spectators are looking at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they are observed when looking at these shows .
you will be watching by Roy and his team who record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or look again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from this this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House celebrates on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time at another company , another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find that a super show and he also uses data for it but it does something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors are .
when they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
you have two very competitive , data sealed .
they connect these lots of data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you g@@ athers millions of data for a decision which one meets then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good TV , or ?
when data analysis doesn &apos;t work so , this is a little start@@ ling , because we are living in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
do anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever get in touch with this software . come in touch with this in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are created . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data se@@ eded companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes does mistakes .
2009 Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year round year round , until it suddenly no longer worked ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , it was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data se@@ eded companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data dropped into decisions of life -- at work , in law , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns across the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a result , you dis@@ integrate this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put the items back together to touch a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and get together .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to place the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this , there is another tool and we all own it : our brain .
when there is something that &apos;s good when the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because it used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not be capable of . but deciding how to take all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they made a great personal risk with that decision .
however , on the contrary , this did the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they for@@ ge TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what we say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will proceed later with a technology demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have so far taken some decisions in my life , whereby I should listen to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something very carefully , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will be kl@@ ash and r@@ ust and r@@ ust . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I consider this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land on the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
