<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacularly released, that the NSA have heard illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service in which the CIA is literally dragged drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and prompted it to call its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional order, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get these information and if they can't protect the identity of the mudtigen that they disclose.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government was ankankle, he did something, what many courageous journalists had already done before him, he refused, and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then just days before the process, something happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been informed for years that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters can always hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and crisen on the statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his telephone calls are secretly concerned,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit cards, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistle-blowers at his time, but instead the judiciary has put more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this one can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of having a whistle-blowers into a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more possibilities to compose all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the afterward, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that still didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source code for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, which was developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is today released by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with every ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will be encrypted and stored on a server, which only the respective news agency will have access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain any more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the start.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders like Edward Snowden have a chance to make misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to tell about abnormalities in the care of soldiers and reported from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental company, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leck of history has been published (] [the "Panama Papers") [which means] [we baten Robert Palmer by Global Witness by a statement.] this week we were hosted by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Moselle Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers can go to companies such as Mosaunch Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you establish it?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that an ally of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend from children's afternoons, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of a agency's or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets into tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians about how secret tax havens are to be used by some few to hide and disgusting their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing it for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuche.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans before, who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, through the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a datleck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some U.S. countries to provide less information to create a company as a reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school boroughs to gamble school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has frauds allowed to rip particularly respectable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African ministers, who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that all of us could make suggestions on an attorney's lawyer, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-meetings. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course he was given to no money in doing so. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has submitted proposals to our secret inquiries.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single peak, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we have to change the rules to make these kinds of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This might sound very dull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a safe optimist, I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen more transparency towards more transparency what the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered at the national registers at the national level, who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind a headline.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up by law to end this type of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I once almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas would be landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a backpot.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Must I offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazar!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk.</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a air mattresses. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh dear! what did I get broken down there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, went on tiptoes at the door, and my sleep door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To lodge people on my air mattresses, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plead, my roommate is drawn and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it to be afraid to transform it into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something about it. our apartment will be a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded as "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests allowed us to sleep for 20 dollar on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham Omeletts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we said our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I passed.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-inhabitant, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented ourselves to the investors: "we would like to create a site where people publicly post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms, whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But it is not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still quite consolation would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you see on the things that you can see. we could be designe.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so make a difference?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a precious sample, which degree can we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your compression-zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your remote cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent approach of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he is working for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had only presented himself with his name; if he tells us whence he comes, how his dog or his children mean?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 judgements, all of them say: "he can really hold very well unlocked phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens the trust crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to submit negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their orders, before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and hometown.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social precursor.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by means of judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But it has more than ten, is changing everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are in price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell us too little, for example" hi! "" "," you get no answer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell me a lot, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted sooner." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "tolle artworks in your home! I'm making vacation with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to restore this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed unauthorised parties or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on behalf of the customer service. all calls came straight to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts me if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our biggest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from 123 million people had only a fraction ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people are familiar to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, there can be miraculous arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to attack heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real protective paragus that can save lives, even though they do not know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a Bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they do not want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave a even longer stay, without charge extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Thus, of course, not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money-operation are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled about this term I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just a" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not just." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "Share economy describes a trade, human relationships promises." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of yourself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place that one visits, a group there would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and to show one in a pub-pentine neighborhood you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground up to share it together?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of solitude and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">South Korea's capital Seoul has already begun this project. many parking spaces, which were included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Have now been offered to residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were pulled out. there were incubators programmes,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, tonight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be visiting a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality, there were also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I don't have to think any time when a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I ask myself why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a brain-washing, is a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Most of the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-master -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am both introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtower-gym-fanatics in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual plimine.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I chose this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I chose the hijab to carry my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you suppressed for yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The somber was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely opposite the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, asked in question, doubted and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of Rhythm leaves me sometimes to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then there was a horrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had turned to an end, looked on the screen and saw the word "Eilder."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people spears from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical error?</seg>

<seg id="301">It is not only my country attacked but on the Nu kindled me the deeds of others of a citizen in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building with it.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember as we drove off -- so deep it went into my seat, and I first feared to be seen as Muslimine.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "" "be vigilant," "" "lead in well lighted areas," "" "Versampled you not." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really branges on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who had attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have taken the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain themselves to himself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and exclude mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor one removes as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all the other Americans, not a tumor in the U.S., but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, prosthand and Olympionions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the shutdown of Mozeen America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be perhaps some parking freeing, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to consider people of other faith tolerant and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in your cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">The radicalization process has observed that it begins online. as a result, the person is cut off from their assembly, even by their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor, or of faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslimine, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1,6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons for their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at it, it is not driving what they read in their" "" "Holy Bible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. each Spirit, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring it only in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that had given birth to her anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists that you spoke a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and her church back.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of using them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept before joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight like the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian governmental system, conformity and Prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: if you have examined testing messages, in which negative over Muslims have been reported, it would vote more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run of the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulation the public to eradicate the foundation of free society that has sensible and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear ends us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective blame, it is not just about to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did such a young man come from my Brotherhood?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razor that was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he posted expressions by Muslims on his facebook-page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or we remained safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We awaken it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave our children, one that would control us through fear, or one where we can control our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove up, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes off, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come to attack us, not to attack us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudiced.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a Nerv.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TEDTalk to work a denkerin with a deep-walk, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say do not fool you. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look to Muslims around the world, and I did this with the greatest study done to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear like an exception to rule, then the rule is usually broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for crafting, is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental surveillance, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcel infiltrate into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of air machines in the Frac Centre built live in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting modes, aircraft can reach high speed and acceleration in the narrogenic room.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-constantly loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it needs to be collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a offsprings of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight has internal sensors to determine the position in space, to determine computations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands gives it on the highest flatness. for example," "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters it can float, and therefore has great benefits at starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of harness rigid is that it is sensitive to turbulence as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in what location the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often present ourselves basic abstract issues that exist at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the petty-possible number of movables for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Two decades ago, educated aircraft were able to fly remotely, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a hobeam.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unfortunately, we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the moneinternal, the mechanical easiest-powered car device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No fractures, hinges and cross-rudes, no further actuation or checkers, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior very much, so that it can fly stable and move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flying, I must throw it right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it right correctly, if all watch, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the Monbuff is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the omniopter with its eight propellists, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he will receive the decent ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction he is filmed or even as he is rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propaganda.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest is getting directly from the fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that there.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller cars.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is spinning in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrucopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"" "" "" "however, something shootting -- an engine or propeller is falling out, the electronics or a cordless - the machine can further fly if limited." ""</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate, by doing half of the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of esthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took wholesale Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than a disc bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to take a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us there is the salary in the development and the creation of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such spectacular ways.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago circled in a very distant galaxy, two black holes are getting faster, you turned, so the mass of Trier probe in a tenths of pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they slit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We speak finally from black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been given into space-time, and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago was barely created several zelliges</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">A group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss decided by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves that are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized it as a crazy genius, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser-interferometers - gravitational-waves Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased, which improved recognition performance tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, you are now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, LIGO was started for a final test run to clear some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes through the earth through.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that which I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist am MIT. he has been studied gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories like LIGO messable signals. what are vitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crose in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the wave, the room and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stretched into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses on relativity theory often perform a proper dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and reservoir, stretch and storage."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us has stretched out the waves and stuffed up. elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum explained the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, the length would have to be measured by less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are gloomy, and with the support of the public there will certainly be overcome all obstacles. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott claims that LIGO is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you by several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible notes have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that would mean you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like tape and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob" "" "she breaks" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make any simple images of objects in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally speak the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, my colleague Scott has been employed for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, cirpen simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same cirpen with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-type, shapes into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard LIGO: [Surrendes noise] Yemen and who knows what he must hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-fold solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rod of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 balls, the other with a mass of 36 sonnen, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the enduring significance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet a completely new way to investigate the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars in super novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur however in the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were transparently glass. the Urbino: I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the prix is obscured by his own descendents.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using vitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am FEELING that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equal in the first attempt of things that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that produces black holes as LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. black holes are the Saucer for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO gives us a completely different view of the events in space, to the origin of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories in Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes!" "", "before I feared me." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if I made me nervous in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just what I feared, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, on an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls all" "" "guess" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guess, I need milk for my beak-whales."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">That yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude of life in my family. from there I snatured to play with them whenever you ask me to do it. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I'll always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I understood that the "YES" had saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a genuine dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things out, do you think of life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creed TV. I mean television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing television, in a big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that were not existed before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television broadcaster can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days once four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars of television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series will run on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still above. I need to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans of the campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say to it, because I know what you think, if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so all of you who work so hard if you're now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I'm talking about work, so you understand that I don't just talk on the computer and imagination, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not working with a dreary job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set up troops as mold I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is how you set a high sound, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruel and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take when I declare them the buzz, that I talk to me that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started working with television production, when I began working and working, to build and work together, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't seek anything other than according to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling not to be able to strive differently than according to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I did not do the failure, and I just know I love the totality.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasting limits, the more work there are, the more work simultaneously, the more watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I monkey, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single workbench.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people, "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "guess, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The volume of the engine is petrol.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my job no more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, edited weekends, no remorals, nothing delegating, a Titan asleep not, gives not up, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think," "" "Heul you from, bluffder author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you are doing it, you do, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother and knows how the sums it feels when you knew the buzz, if the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress "Ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out to the outside, and she says," "" "Mama, Do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, when two things are going to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she does not called me "guess."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "it calls no one more" "" "guess." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my totals, and here everything is changing before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mama, Do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters encounter it, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the swamp, I can do nothing but to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I monkey, the marathon, I run, the army, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid sounds, delicate voices, waist stickers and the song in which it goes to letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Age."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost will come in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we forget.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium area, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums it.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the desire of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real totals is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the corresponding tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is the voice of God in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for what God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this rule, so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the money again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not surprising to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entry is painful, because what a person does not work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We relaxed in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make little dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disbursting Seifencing en.</seg>
<seg id="735">But I feel predominantly stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always looking for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how you live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! if you want to play with you always Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me for naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have the right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they like that they want something else to do.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienketle or Keks replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And she talks about my teenage daughter, all 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids will be ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my comforting, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is considered to feel the buzz, a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "in general," "" "games" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I know and I see. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan at training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not have a full 15 minute treat?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz went back in my free time. the sums appear to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. she gives me new ideas. I use it to my fullest and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Silk inflatable and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me schnapps that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my teeth are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I go monkey, the marathon, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, smile, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I bet you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreadjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and to play more." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the best known, the "crucifixion stimulation." thereby implanted a electrode deep in the brain, in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological feature improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Nuro-healing does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading upper doctor and worked day and night in an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I gave patients with skull-Hirn trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain matlt and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, one sometimes need to remove a portion of benevolent brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of taking the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist who analyzes the brain.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a gun powder, is comparable with very small children that can be taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed to run Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, inmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you know yet from biologieLearning, that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into every cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass inside the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells had changed differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but had changed differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our big-stags cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they aware of us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain pieces from non-speaking areas and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently highlight color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we plagued them at the discovery of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the self-ologist Transplantation -- Autotranlant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we plasted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plasted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with ape.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we plunged the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks it was completely disappeared as if they were taken back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we created an injury to and rhyrued exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they washed up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were rhyrued.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these little points. these are the cells we colds in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Will these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we designed monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we had the Mobilemotorization range in the motoric Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recover spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastique brain mechanisms. they will recover to some degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the hack had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not as fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, see when we plasted the cells: the same nods, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can use them freeze and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you how the human brain gives the means to heal themselves.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future, how many years will it take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it permit us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already takes a long time to select the patients using treatments and evaluate whether it's useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric trial.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the breaking plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchanging geyness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his large imitators in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- became clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to influence the austerity programmes that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my undisputed friends told me that democracy would be abolished if something would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup, we could save democracy, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies will be hampered, our future dark and our great, new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">For the topic of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin" "" "Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. they know and recognize it as the debt mountain that casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the forgiveness of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which, however, is one of too anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and income which could be able to carry out the mountain mountain and also produce all the things which the human race is urgently needed, for example, "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the US, in England and in the euro area, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which had been around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not the same through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus father who could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Ödipus father, who would be afraid that his son would kill him if he will grow,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unseasoned the circumstances led to the fact that oils kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful Art All the unproductive capital was to be used to develop our lives, develop human talents, and especially to finance all of the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think, but before we continue, what do we understand of democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the society form, where the outdoors and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Athenian democracy closed to many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to make the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenic democracy was and is that they were the laboring poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of speech, but more importantly, and crucial that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same balancing in matters of state rod.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly hidden.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies have not its roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens, and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy - the world of corporations -- a democratic free zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies has existed since the time that this separation of politics and the economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, as the economy is gradually migrated to politics and deprived them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer like they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you cannot be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and separate the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores which sustains so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy which is so far-balanced by the economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political estates is increasing, the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labor power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policies and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control reserves, just as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't work very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">"" "but there is one solution: the working arms is emerging!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohnaut through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economics and politics are separate areas, the automating the twin summit will be higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we need to reunite the economy and reunite the economy and politics and make sure that we are more democratic in a unified field, otherwise we end the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix" which is solved in the machines and put human energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, "agora," in long talks the sense of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what hurts it, how could it look to have this "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is followed by a job of the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those who belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no upsurge at the twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please just imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the twenty-largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire trade of trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the surplus surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe will is at the same time liberalism, in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because she will bury the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and key, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystoples?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You described you in your biography yourself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunion of politics and economics is... Do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which indicates Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am also completely enterodly.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not a wirr, one does not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said this. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you hold from the viewpoint of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of business -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I must say this as provocative, China resembles today the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberal, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what the democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of violence to hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners curious about your experiences as Minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to say goodbye to the self-sufficiency, and the perpetual denial that a massive distortion to the euro area ran, and continues to massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal to deny that denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to be the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you are trying to preserve an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism into life, it will perhaps delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you think ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or anyone who, after 6 months in office, particularly in such a tense situation, claiming that he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The major error was to mark the application to extend the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"" "" "" "I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the backers to find a common solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, only because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that proceeded by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that it had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of you have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 mid-term minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leitner at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a clock and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for giving the shows and the content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are all right at this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of over 2500 TV shows on the IMDb website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Your show will be rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking bath," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where, after getting a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at that end, shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not get to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you have already need special intelligence to prohibit "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on the medium term, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't amaze.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where everyone can view each free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon exists for nothing, it is possible to go correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watching by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from this this is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House celebrates on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time at another company, another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find that a super show and he also uses data for it but it does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors are.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these lots of data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gathers millions of data for a decision which one meets then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis doesn't work so, this is a little startling, because we are living in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Do anyone know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one will ever get in touch with this software. come in touch with this in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are created. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data seeded companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes does mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way can be predicted -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year round year round, until it suddenly no longer worked,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it just didn't work, it was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data seeded companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data dropped into decisions of life -- at work, in law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns across the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you disintegrate this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you put the items back together to touch a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and get together.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disintegrate a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to place the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this, there is another tool and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something that's good when the brain is good, it's parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because it used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not be capable of. but deciding how to take all of these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they made a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">However, on the contrary, this did the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they forge TV-ideas, then as they chose "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that is what we say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will proceed later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "I have so far taken some decisions in my life, whereby I should listen to the ball in retrospect." ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something very carefully, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will be klash and rust and rust. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I consider this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land on the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
