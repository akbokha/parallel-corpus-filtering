Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that make your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where people should meet today .
a tomb which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers help the sti@@ cky cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories of days .
it is nervous when land@@ cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
this knows every one who had to remember , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a wal@@ k@@ way .
the historical Land@@ mark of the Digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are anything but topical - but that is why very conclu@@ ding .
especially when comparing them to current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one does not recognise as such .
in the vast picture postcard have been incorporated for cities and municipalities for more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional blades .
these ar@@ isen according to the Bav@@ arian Ver@@ mess@@ engers administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and then skip the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ation with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops finally went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , 9 February 18@@ 01 : we were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ measurable Bureau .
the commissioned by Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others to find at the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison E@@ arly / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the card of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was built in 21 years after the map of the map , thus 1877 , as a Mün@@ chner district .
today Sig@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses under@@ mining are located around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ anic road , which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bav@@ arian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when the first glance : when there is a small @-@ called map with dozens of lines and figures : hand @-@ in writing numbered Fl@@ ur@@ ks from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ up , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
there are no small plots there today no farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &apos; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 swing of the October Revolution , was in fact still a meadow - and not concrete .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the judgement sheet , one reads in the area of today &apos;s District Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not just the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the height of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once find people with ins@@ criptions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner District @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the establishment of this psychiat@@ rist who is brought up in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time , and for example , the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , he was forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime even this capacity reached no more - the reason for the construction of the cycles in H@@ air 1905 .
there , since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ r@@ ists .
on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex 1920 and walked it into a youth @-@ home with education establishments .
west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the Children @-@ Haus &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; was set in architectural attention to the country of origin of the Ir@@ vine which was destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was located around 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the merchant named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies exp@@ elled in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big remained to this day - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages was once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn platform .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
Civil Rights published travel@@ o@@ tion for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for promoting coloured has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Mis@@ souri due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board of the State of Mis@@ souri , who will come into force until 28 August 2017 , when travelling through the state and provide extreme caution , as a number of frag@@ mentary occur@@ ren@@ oun@@ ces @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state and can be noted here , &quot; says in the statement of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it difficult to win Dis@@ criminal proceedings , as well as the pro@@ secu@@ tions of the state , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , led the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of citizens &apos; rights that happen to men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin color , they will be assembled or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such an incidence we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
the incidents like rac@@ ist inde@@ xes against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ essee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ mentary circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no longer had a gasoline during the journey and was accused of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime accused .
the Council also pointed out to a recent report by the Office of the Governor @-@ State Building of Mis@@ souri , in which black motor@@ ists on the State will be 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring it money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , following the latest figures from the hate speech , report to the F@@ BI , which steps the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the commen@@ cement of travel is also a response to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult to resist a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Society ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel openings for Texas and Arizona , following the States of immigration laws passed to comply with local law enforcement authorities , to comply with people because of immigration violations , which in view of AC@@ L@@ U will contribute to further pensions .
tourist openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ mar project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n project is a success project and continues in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have provided a picture on site .
the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into its operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and as many young animals looked after and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
the &quot; black hole &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter mark@@ eter away for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes only region@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fis@@ bach , he signed the Wei@@ mar project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can not be profitable in such steep areas .
the green space care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the Motor@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers , even if he does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the importance of the turn@@ around project and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers must support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be withdrawn for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts about how they continue their business , &quot; said the mayor .
the farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion .
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure surface is thus 40 hectares , which must not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 euros the half over leader was promoted , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
so we love the farmers 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter We@@ iss was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape In@@ struc@@ tor ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of Wei@@ de@@ ten@@ unen .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a conve@@ yor of the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the in@@ vigor@@ ous area should not be p@@ liable ( H@@ ang@@ lement over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ous project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who would like to build almost 16 kilometres fence .
the disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ty and liberty is@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he resor@@ ted to their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta described here : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem to which you refer to later has been added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is per@@ missible properly , but as he form@@ ulating it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary response to the rising words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immig@@ rant , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fatigue , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who desire to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the waste waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller is not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who decided to place their words after their death at the base - did know very well that they performed a highly @-@ political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting it in an un@@ used classical imaging , the female embodiment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .
and she gives himself another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to return from the right wing to this long time .
the great cry as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty was nobody dra@@ wer , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative one who bring the US flame into the re@@ comp@@ uted world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead .
she shall bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something razor .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception .
the great fanta@@ si@@ ev@@ ous act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen from the sublime , miserable , but hope@@ ful people after long and often terrible journeys on the Dec@@ ks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the prospect of reaching the Miller and Tru@@ mp ever .
her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , which is the only source of power to ign@@ ite .
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black Pl@@ astic members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two bow@@ ls were belonged to the Great Britain team .
the power @-@ director of the Un@@ ch@@ ant@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ year member of the World Championship can make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special develops &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish ath@@ lets think that something has to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish ath@@ lets are medals cont@@ enders , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m circuit while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the crew for the team chapel .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her captain speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Commonwealth of silver Medal , which is competing at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that 16 bow@@ ls in the British team are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland has so far been the best total of athletes at the World Championship seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ winding Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European re@@ cor@@ ds last year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m loops .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are who runs around 1,500 m is another s@@ so@@ ons which one was able to observe the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle was reminded of its first world Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the Mann@@ es@@ men &apos;s captain in say that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their country@@ men not only belong to the team , but in some cases the medals and the fin@@ als will join in the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be special about the team captain in it , it is that it was a great honour from the other members of the team , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose it , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the bow@@ ls who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ diums .
what do my speech deal as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it &apos;s just like to be a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking of critics about Facebook : please don &apos;t care about a public office if you cannot tolerate the di@@ aling of voters
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers suggested it for all , from the internal policy up to his political principles .
he sli@@ pped in criticism , safe .
but he did not have his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and word@@ less we are led to the sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Society compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
the st@@ ab of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the on @-@ line comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan@@ ese .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very ade@@ pt at making Facebook as the primary means to link up with its voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his site .
hence the block@@ ade of individuals coming to the Board of Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that will be officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the Com@@ ment of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not filled with water , but she asked for hate speech .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same topic , then they are more rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what are the members of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam attack , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would others call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance , and to burn demonstrators , and to be sil@@ enced .
but exactly this happens exactly digital .
Ho@@ gan@@ ese is not the first public officials to critici@@ ze it , that he ch@@ imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Court James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er of her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the moment Washington &apos;s time had a similar impact on the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence to his leadership .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; used , wrote all letters of newspapers , who made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and shipping with UK , rel@@ o@@ oned his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not been sil@@ enced .
freedom of speech , opinion of opinion and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
former Europeans No 1 Ron@@ an raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on domestic comfort , as Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian shows the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which was last year next door in the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the final dogs , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new eye @-@ place and acts as a tournament message in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set up this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous fi@@ ery of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time even though he won a long @-@ year career in both the European tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels so special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open cannot defend , because it was in the year after I had won it , taken out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win .
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r says the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio at the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ahe .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six tops in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the parking fee is £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive @-@ smoke
in the past two decades fewer people died because of the pas@@ sports of lung cancer .
at this result , scientists of the University Hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer is attributable to passive exposure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hei@@ ko Becher &apos;s cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he took an own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer dis@@ cases for passive exposure per year in Germany .

pets are proving to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie in the time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the head of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of home@@ work , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the sub@@ background is much wasted , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which is continually ham@@ pered the construction work , represents a big problem for the B@@ aut@@ rup@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z are engaged in the bridge for weeks with the work on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with a cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use stove .
it is even rarely used a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shelves in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally sets a sweet potato - locally than &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the ch@@ ained tu@@ ber is removed with ze@@ al@@ ous hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay fire - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a l@@ atin .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village co@@ ats are unemployed , and many drink difficult , and there is the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was adopted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.@@ 0@@ 26 elders were supposed to vote in the occupation of occupation .
an existing movement which stir@@ red up the Dutch domination rapidly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions thereof .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo , and made of cor@@ ru@@ ble@@ ers , which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very few Indones@@ ian have made their journey here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because journalists and practically no foreigners have taken place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans sent a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is an Indones@@ ian Province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line , and some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indon@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gol@@ d@@ mine of the world , grass mountain , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has assembled the value of $ 3.2 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources in the value of valued 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this wealth is a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which make sure that Indones@@ ian military forces a suff@@ oc@@ ative presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ties and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0.000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ dian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden G@@ ans and are dealt with mer@@ c@@ il@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500,000 pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed from the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 , tor@@ tured and de@@ tained .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as @-@ tribal authorities in the 1970 @-@ 1980s were subject to complic@@ ity in the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
the Indones@@ ian police in the past year alone was more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the region .
&quot; we Wer@@ der All Ver@@ sions &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ bane taken from the year 2016 , such as un@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims because each week &apos;s incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have intensified as pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , since Muslim economic migrants are transformed from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese War@@ ung can@@ ines sell baked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ anu@@ ts .
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address the inequalities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann promised 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel betrayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i with anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October only two months after J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is initiation .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christ@@ mas@@ lie@@ der before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the scar@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took the impetus at her tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , said , and sm@@ ote the group with their ri@@ bs , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was hit so hard that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and escal@@ ate things the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police station and the military commander in order to ask justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and im@@ itated as a bird @-@ like - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstrators began to drag stones at police and military post .
when the mood was heated , the soldier was sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not approved by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called for tranquility and called upon the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful old wooden house .
kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who was fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his C@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and examined his body to be sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears no name as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in dark mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ ite of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters , that his officers will only want to secure their station , &quot; because they will be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ ught to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others have been wounded .
the news on the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for families of victims and s@@ wor@@ e who address historical mis@@ ses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he establishes a extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the talking began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 2000 years .
the point is that we have ple@@ dged to address these violations , but there are processes that must undergo progress , &quot; he said .
then the Wir@@ anto made an retreat than he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME and said , he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua was already proclaimed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposed such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ous in@@ fi@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am we@@ ary . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a building company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others have been wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
arranged villagers prot@@ esting in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who re@@ acted by war@@ ts war@@ ts .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and killed a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the latter had been delivered fast here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have two days hidden in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been an un@@ ru@@ gated board for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of tribal gen@@ dered Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , living in the green Highlands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by introducing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pretext of securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as usual .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruits and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to edit four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the crop for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 ind@@ ones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger number since opening new routes to the airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the president of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense .
beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ its and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the films .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy General Manager of Human Rights Watch , the promises of J@@ ok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of reporting to raise transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indon@@ esi@@ ens to the most eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua . visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six p@@ acific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen islands - the UN Human Rights Council , to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically considered the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred back the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , he visited her silence and pressed him . &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that took part in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia also has another presidential election , but Pap@@ ua say they will probably not be right for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants that J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in im@@ pover@@ ished educ@@ ative and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for J@@ ok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ S@@ uss@@ ave led a final symbolic act of the Des@@ cent : the cor@@ pse of an op@@ fer was buried in just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a super@@ visor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its trans@@ cription and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that is laid in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is called random@@ ly the tor@@ ch @-@ tower ( F@@ ack@@ el @-@ tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alert and scre@@ aming people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of the burned fight against 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock in place ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire cleared and the building cleared .
the government said it &apos;s working on providing accommodations for those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in foreign areas throughout the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding to the decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain she said the police , she thinks that the system of plates for isol@@ ating and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with its great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was not only supported on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
although often very long , but therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics remain the tradition of tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only under lack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ro@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the fatty acids .
even not only to the vote , after many contradictions before the proposal came to the final place at a neutral place .
new beginning of 2018 are just compar@@ atively small details : thus , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will in future be able to have the host right next year .
to l@@ essen the cost of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements of training courses etc. are easier and players will have to be completed before the Davis Cup fewer official media events .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers brings bot@@ any items into the plane , finds a survey
a survey among passengers reported that more than 20 per cent consciously or unaware objects decreased to the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent , which appeared the plane , while they accidentally absorbed kni@@ fes or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed , they had delayed that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - that was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers tend to dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respondents , the assur@@ ances that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Millennium , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items referred to T@@ SA agents were un@@ inten@@ tionally subject to food and liquids were foodstuffs and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to know@@ ingly conf@@ essed objects with blades through security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respondents and 3.@@ 7 per cent of the male respondents also confirmed that they would have dis@@ visi@@ bly banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it had asked travellers around the country to find out how many accidentally smug@@ gl@@ ware brought in by the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it is no surprise that the people who are most suitable smug@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ solic@@ it - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA policies are a bit complicated and confusing .
the people are often unsure what fluids are allowed to take or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids affected by T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated items .
for a time people thought the T@@ SA could see books as smug@@ gl@@ ware .
liquids is allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k can be found with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he has now signed up until now that a part of the customer has already re@@ trac@@ ed their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the continually tri@@ ump@@ kin numbers of sales growth and even more gigantic branches , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed for the first time a different , less smooth number : that of the cancellation in the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k had often applied with the more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k Mus@@ k said : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 already have been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation policy Tes@@ la has paid the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are presented , sp@@ te Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader doesn &apos;t believe .
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 cars supplied .
2018 : to 2018 it is said to be - all models - 500,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever orders a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is allowed to reck@@ on in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand @-@ new , has never been tested in practice without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum pay@@ load . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ tim@@ eliness of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
for then , the company cannot prevent the content of dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ itt moves back to the reduction of emissions from the Obama &apos;s rules on reducing emissions
one day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 States , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities in response to the previous administrative authorities .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which had been raised against his previous place in a federal court court .
it &apos;s about a period that ran on October 1st for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; im@@ pe@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to im@@ pe@@ de local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed by President Donald Tru@@ mp pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time to face a reliable opponent of the environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block and delay regul@@ ations which res@@ isted the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the P@@ ru@@ dence regul@@ ator agenda .
last month , a federal tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA administration has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane ple@@ cks .
in an opinion issued on Wednesday evening , he suggested that his about @-@ face in o@@ zone standards simply proposed the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards strengthened .
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA often did not adhere to the deadlines for carrying out and then to be judged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement reached the appointment for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .

tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 16.@@ 30 p.m. to a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ figer system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth charity @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours to their concern .
Walter Martin@@ i empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village of treasure .
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was first mentioned in the Wur@@ gic Ur@@ l book : Earl Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the church church of Tum@@ lingen , including the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; by Mag@@ ister E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , was also a glorious court that belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age right and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ lingen are still to be recognized , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the glorious settlement of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin this historical circumstances .
the pat@@ ron@@ age was made up of the early medieval village .
one Lord , who built a church , re@@ funded and occupied with a pastor , continues to be owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church .
related to this was the right to use a pastor or to propose the bishop a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two sh@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell appeared for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the shut@@ ters were caught and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 lag@@ ged French troops near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church broke off .
only the Kir@@ t@@ ur@@ m was allowed to stand .
in the New Year @-@ eight 18@@ 34 , a storm ra@@ ged the cherry and half a storm .
to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken off .
only the tower alive today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em took care of the &quot; Schaff@@ iss@@ ors &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as an organizer invite the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel .
this is designed by the comb@@ o of the Ke@@ pler School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with posts of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
local em@@ ir@@ er Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 pm .

&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the promot@@ ers place the fantastic view .
the Seren@@ ade is only held on dry weather .
the promot@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hear@@ ings .
the friends and Pat@@ rons of Tum@@ by feel particularly obliged to the home @-@ care , such as Seren@@ ade @-@ Organis@@ ator Walter Martin@@ i .
association aims to test permission from Wind@@ ow@@ ls
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see the legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; for@@ ested himself &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) called on its authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines would have had to be approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen merely on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal , there exists a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time , the concentration zone also causes the exclusion of wind power for the rest of the urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power plant in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a form of shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the lack of planning legal requirement , the given appro@@ vals is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rep@@ ute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ k , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the coun@@ cill@@ or decided in front of the summer break again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cold : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the division of authorisation for the construction of wind turbines as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been noted since last week in circles of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to examine the matter again .
however , they do not lead to the fact that the procedure will be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of current proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak the content of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasoning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette building the construction of four to 200 meters high wind@@ wheels .
already last year , the company had participated in which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved in @-@ making agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - that is equivalent to a fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
last summer there were four @-@ legged coun@@ cill@@ ors , green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acks down : woman dies in dre@@ ad@@ ful accident

a woman was killed in the process .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the Landes@@ straße stayed more than hours locked .
according to police , a 17 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch drove to her car as part of the accompanying driver with her 53 @-@ year mother as an accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and traders plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .

&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brief@@ ing day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ made Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers to Saturday and ren@@ oun@@ cing parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
furthermore , customer potenti@@ als should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
in the end , all of them should contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - up to landlords , the farms throughout the city and ship@@ pers .
it landed , with a network that sur@@ passed the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy which have spread partly , had said king in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared his third home country shop on the country , for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities participate .

Tru@@ mp executed after thorough trans@@ cription of phone calls , Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp challenged in a phone at the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President cr@@ ates him , because he had denoun@@ ced the walls publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This may not tell you the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with a promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
trans@@ cription of his initial appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m trainers were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. F@@ us said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridiculous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence of the Obama has been taught to look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after spending a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ key , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk from the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men stood out with gun to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged in a needle @-@ strike - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ o@@ oned the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l it from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams were torn in the silence , when a young black man was torn away from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene was played , which was played on 22 July , only a post@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if then a loop is thrown &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 he came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is truly un@@ constitu@@ ent that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the post@@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that wron@@ gly bl@@ ur a wron@@ gly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want action , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of court puts a cloth on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI acts that were received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were den@@ amed from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ alities in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on an open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black people in Georgia for the first time to settle their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to details of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ ms Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said , the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby was wearing it , not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from prison , and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came closer , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b conver@@ ts the car .
&quot; how it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and arranged the mor@@ ale , &quot; closing it out of a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there were a compromise between state and local pro@@ secu@@ tions , which was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , blocking evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks make it even more concise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a voting massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote then this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual descend@@ ant of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is an illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is based in a kind of deep racism that many believe that in America he does not exist anymore .
it is difficult to watch , and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you would not want to listen to me or not want to listen to what I have done . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whit@@ eness and the rest of the bl@@ acks - into a space and lu@@ sion@@ ed as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the head @-@ clan member for years , but he said the roll will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story in life because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester scre@@ ams and op@@ hag@@ us , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disgu@@ ise from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ ased the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least every black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene Battle at the lau@@ test .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oh , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ te of one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and precisely because the energy shifts in the room , a sense of comra@@ des@@ hip replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with re@@ prints .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends non @-@ violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots , and then silence .
a woman , with a funer@@ al garment , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Billi@@ e Holidays trau@@ matic &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spectators of sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the road .
they have witnessed nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as impres@@ sing moisture when Broo@@ ks she leads on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de , the air feels like the same .
if the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites us to get closer and to insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy as if he wants to remember .
after a few minutes he would like to thank Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the train that has played the C@@ lan@@ ka .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aced two of his fellow @-@ players and then collap@@ ses into their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with it .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for one reason . &quot;
later the audience collabor@@ ates with the actors for dinner .
at a table chat@@ ting a white pair from Atlanta via the post@@ position with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and doing that , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks yard at his table , he eats and remember the civil rights .
he said , he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ position is particularly inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing of it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let another country concert ship over himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the sc@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ opping in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased .
&quot; one notes that the public has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said just before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of his view .
I prefer a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ ony in the furniture pur@@ se , once a week I &apos;m helping in Gre@@ ens in the furniture .
and I worked already in the open whole day at school .
what is your experience with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years old , so a late professional volunteer .
how does it come about ?
quantity : I have done Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering , let &apos;s say , successfully broken .
I recognised for me that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I wondered what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , as you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe too , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social life .
I will study dual , probably do a social job training and student at Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not uncommon to have several different areas of use during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you can be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from Alter@@ sheim up to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ care management .
for me it was just what mat@@ ured for me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different from the builder &apos;s studies ?
amount : well clear , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics .
there are always other people behind each other , each of which have a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee , a teen@@ ager , who has been fet@@ ched from the family - you always have to go on to it .
very interesting .
and you did not have any reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so is life too .
Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ ferences by 72 percent since another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure by which the company is facing .
the job @-@ installation , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on officially announced for the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 places already lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit through the quick step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month participated in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House at the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remains unchanged , having achieved a growth of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds during the first half of the year .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide attacks
a su@@ icide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital of Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several others have been violated .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been violated , shared a statement by Nato .
un@@ confirmed local reports , in case of the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district , also died three civilians .
the bombing is the last force of violence that Afghanistan made this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ bed two people were killed near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato , it is meant to happen the explosion on Thursday evening as a joint pat@@ rol Army with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; by persons captured improvis@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement states that all comparisons are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital at the airport of Bag@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dent say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops at the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which about 20 % in the capital .
end of July a su@@ icide @-@ car@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly fancy district of Kab@@ ul .

on 31 May , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed over 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 sup@@ pressed the Taliban by the power .
the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp are considering to increase the number of U.S. troops , the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dent say that the su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks will also have a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule to kill
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to de@@ ple@@ te the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 States proclaimed the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ization 2015 &quot; and said it is showing the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and reminded that we react to our governmental partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt in June announced the intention of EPA to set up o@@ zone policies - in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to set up where inc@@ isions must be made to delay more stringent air quality standards - in order to delay a year through to October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , met on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations that has imposed on the former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , efforts have triggered the back of democrats and nature groups to worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and reinforce the breath@@ able symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
community Directors intends to have communal space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two contra@@ ven@@ es the council of flu@@ ff winds up the establishment of a common space in the future senior residence .
prior to the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement signed to the still missing property section , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
while the parish community is still owned by the church , there is no plans for that of a private investor to em@@ ing the project anymore .
there is a discussion regarding a common space .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and majority of the community council led to such a common room , not as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example made the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the decision , which has been decided by providing support for the current budget already last autumn , with funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a communal space would have reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed proposal to sign@@ alize the investor that in this regard , you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the acknowled@@ gement that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which lowers the ambient temperature - which reduces the tear @-@ height and the construction of economic power - is possible .
need@@ less , this is not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this hint .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he happens to the body .
not so easy it goes with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you are not quite right now , for this you are now looking at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks absolutely for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it can see behind it a con@@ stric@@ ted sub@@ missions to any well @-@ being or even foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you can &apos;t give a grant , but getting a real , in doubt of doubt , the counter @-@ speech is true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stadium &apos;s application , proposed by the proposed proposal , takes place three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the case with two counterparts in the original program , which concludes Stefan H@@ aller so : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision , we make a huge step there to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti needs to ren@@ oun@@ ce of David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the confirmed by the Italians on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ chn@@ ern Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defeats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of its team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not least good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official vocation of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great trust that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights are the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , shared the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the Har@@ z of Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Har@@ z , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be developed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte San Andre@@ as@@ berg .
you will find a planetary path in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is contrary to the indi@@ gent of many hard@@ ships , it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .
members want to set up along the planned route and inform about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ achiev@@ able installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ inqu@@ ire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ et and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by the internet .
that is why the selection of thousands will play a good mobile @-@ network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the Star@@ way train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Star@@ way , the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star looks stronger than another , even though it lie much further away .
I also conve@@ ys in which constellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 the association has been operating in the Berg@@ town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is part of the Federal Ministry of Natural Protection to the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromed@@ a galaxy are visible with naked eye .
in the university city , since 2003 , there has been a bit similar to the initiative of the conve@@ yor planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen a bit similar to the planned star@@ ters - the Plan@@ etary weg .
starting in front of Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e that forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary path leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as a &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na .
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the single planets - including that of the Zwerg@@ plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at a distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks such on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away the sun is approximately 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
the entire distance of the planet Earth is about four kilometers .
while the light of sun takes up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestrian is a good hour up to the p@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
foot@@ er are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fi@@ x@@ star however would last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should be in a collision to the most exciting pit fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ brid@@ led world Bo@@ xing Council , the corridor downhill to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko to welcome the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ spring champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision over the former four @-@ divisions world master Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you see Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
as the couple for photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Climate , that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have asc@@ ended for bronze &#91; to 140 Po@@ und &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run down on light weight .
and he must move on Lei@@ cht@@ wei@@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko was agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate is asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will make Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 pounds of a year to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 button @-@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight game fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and went open later to fight with the network that offers the best financial pack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he admired Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might be part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triple champion from River@@ side shows &quot; very slowly , &quot; sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to know the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show percussion , then boxes .
both said , they could feel the Mom@@ entum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates as much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have waited for the top @-@ fighter , and this is Mi@@ key .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four ver@@ ti@@ sts to the tire
on Thursday afternoon four people were injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 p.m. , shortly before the connecting place market , probably after a tyre control over his vehicle .
the passenger gate to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ threw himself and then remained on the roof of the ro@@ am .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the last through the ambul@@ ance service , the A7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be passing on the left lane on the accident line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was happy , with the result , even if not the two oppos@@ ites would have been in 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ acker will continue to be optimized in the Or@@ e Mountains .
and a gate after a free trial , the Fort@@ une also want to be cat@@ ered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experiences in preparation with the three @-@ party , than with the qu@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helmet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but Hoffmann is very safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ positions on the semi@@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ieren and we don &apos;t afford so many deduc@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether one can speak about a failed start from a failed start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the podium , we will certainly be able to talk of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I take the start into the seasons only after six to eight play days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helmet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which did not want to speak from an advantage over the auction , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ matur@@ ely had to be broken down because of a we@@ t@@ storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , believe that players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her , as they had no heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascension of ascension into the bone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner defen@@ ders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests out of the Rhin@@ eland go as a little favorite on Sunday in meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we are entitled to get among the first six chs is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose balance is quite positive in just a defeat for Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must hit from the beginning , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and exaggerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el will not have to experience his players in the Sunday on Sunday .
new findings of the Swedish asylum @-@ age test tests published
recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of those tested people have been tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority of for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzle @-@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
they should do more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ atory verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of several refugees who were inf@@ erior .
until today , migr@@ atory cases has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ able cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no major difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are rather constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has lied over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the person studied 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 243 these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , made in x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee @-@ teeth , which are then analyzed by tooth@@ ed and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defend the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally speaking , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy emphasis was placed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ ily , Bau@@ leiter at the Department of Road and Transport in the government of Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time at all three sandy beach bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and it is for sure that the schedule is respected .
coming the first bridge , coming by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , runs through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault of concrete , which is lined with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
built in 1900 it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
to guarantee the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is a boundary attachment that is used as a factory path .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is scheduled to get a 2,@@ 20 meters wide bridge folder .
then the pedestrian is to be gone .
the special thing is that it deals with manufacturing , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented b@@ los@@ ers .
particular finger@@ tips has required the wir@@ ing of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass @-@ fibre , which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ paper about the project .
moreover , fish and cancer had to be f@@ lown away .
for the bridges between the building building and the gra@@ ze in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge on Lau@@ ter@@ bacher , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three breasts is about 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ g in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it does not happen so often that parties tend to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ g ) , coming together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties involved in Kre@@ ist@@ ag volcano bodies ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that is on this day peacefully flag because the Af@@ g in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ invites to the poster &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ z forms the top leader in the Bundestag on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the African people , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains color@@ fully . &quot;
originally , the town picnic was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , but is now taking place on the parking spot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful image that offers itself there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A world and one of the authorit@@ ative organizers , really rejoice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ery of German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ g without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought it with him .
the police have reli@@ ed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she also shows our presence at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ ak have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported on the African Vol@@ can@@ al@@ fel area , he strives to make such an event and got the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had in demand first in Dau@@ n , but there was a failure , because because of the already built @-@ built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch were not enough parking available .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes are pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : against 20 o &apos;clock a band provides a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ President Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting to wait for the top edge candidates for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice @-@ president Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ ak event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there it is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
police cannot move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a reunion with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concert tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in concert music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and pri@@ zew@@ inner of many international competitions and have won Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top @-@ top priests .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ts is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to cross not only the borders on their instruments but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ S@@ gram , mix classical music , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall artwork .
this core piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg with the success of Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her special acou@@ sti@@ cs will be consciously included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him until the end of their lives .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; so Kr@@ isten Stewart quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I get into gri@@ lled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh it was cool , what comes next as a neighbour ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relation of Hol@@ ly@@ it@@ stars was that of her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson that eventually fought hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the brunette performer on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been in love with everyone I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think about , I have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kr@@ isten said that she bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed in it seriously .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially underneath , they have suffered as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time , when she prefer to dress like a book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really has been very hurt .
when I was eleven the kids said , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt terri@@ fied , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to make their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to make yourself a certain way and anno@@ yed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me some un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a manifestation with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed themselves from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke in ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as coach would I say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp gave us a great announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice approved not the Democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal @-@ mines in five countries and inherited a carbon shop from his father .
he is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening a statement in which it said : &quot; the Party Shift of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party who would rather prevent us from working together to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation by C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the worldwide boss of Lei@@ ch@@ ant@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday , which he described as an apparent excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he reiter@@ ated it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics boss , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin commented at the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tic World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct to the sport and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , those with competitions gold and silver medals were cut off . &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was found information on public subsidies in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and do everything possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said it was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia won the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nine Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships that will start Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re@@ viewing .
dr@@ ap@@ tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers still be free , he said re@@ porters in London following a presentation at IA@@ AF Council .
funer@@ al pact for in Mali exposed to soldiers
at a funer@@ al party in Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter type in Mali re@@ com@@ promised soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
as yet un@@ explained , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the two conversion rates but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to be above this highest victim , which they did in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old rod sh@@ be@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
her offspring were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at mid@@ day , only the relatives were given in the church farewell .
after that , the funer@@ al party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives from the army as well as politics .
they were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General Manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trau@@ t@@ ä@@ ste rose Roses , the members of the arm were arm arm to the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers per@@ secuted the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense from Le@@ yen made the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ m@@ t@@ mann saw the flight operation of the battle @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and sei had been one of the first six trained tiger pilot of its regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ &apos;s , commander of the regime , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , it could not have wasted . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali showed Minister of Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funer@@ al party the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be pun@@ o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by his wife next to his wife .
the divided the Royal House on Thursday with .
traditionally , the Danish kingdom will be buried in the cathedral @-@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a coff@@ kop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , called it further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik buried , be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ die in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he went into retirement and also places the title &quot; Prince &apos;s beam . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he doesn &apos;t see himself as equal to his wife - even not after the death , L@@ ene Balle@@ by , the chief @-@ speaking of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Laboratory de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Order of Adel@@ s@@ ame , has met Mar@@ gre@@ ens 1965 in London .
on the Thames , he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people continually flew , prince Hen@@ rik had a serious state in his almost 50 years of reg@@ isters at the Dan@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , Sei@@ den@@ str@@ ung instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intel@@ lect , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ PD on possible majority in Lower Saxony
rec@@ our@@ ful Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a rapid re@@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he said on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Gre@@ ens from its Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the Land@@ tag , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ hou took its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( des@@ erts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to take them .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on country , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country tag will be regular on the 14th of January .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l is holding it indispensable for the reason that the country decides to solve its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state version also sees the possibility that the coun@@ ties of the Prime Minister elect the trust and el@@ ects an successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be examined in legally clean &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the Tw@@ ist step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she was referred to as a voc@@ alist of Black @-@ Green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ re@@ plen@@ um members of the return of their country council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her country house , which she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distributed the provincial Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately chosen to lead no foreign language in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the trans@@ former of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens from El@@ ke T@@ ests to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of the former Gre@@ ens in Nieder@@ sachsen is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the outlet Tw@@ ist will cost red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the political leader , &quot; in her last van@@ ity and in their frustration , her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony with@@ hold this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to turn into political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tional CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his MEPs to take El@@ ke T@@ hou into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , ki@@ cked T@@ sar to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the Land@@ tag election in 2013 .

Minister for Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxicity , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) discourse and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ing eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and review the st@@ amping pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the substances concerned .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to all that we are currently aware of a health supplement is virtually impossible .
does Al@@ di take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the expl@@ orer by the federal minister is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has been immediately plug@@ ged immediately and since announcements from Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are retri@@ ev@@ able for consumers .
trade has just as well as the manufacturers to bear care that the sold @-@ selling products are traffic @-@ capable and are uniform .
if by eggs of the highest level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not limited .
Un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time is not the companies to blame .
are manufacturing operations and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
after the high level of knowledge , the manufacturing industry does not meet immediate debt .
rather , they must reck@@ on due to the predomin@@ ance of illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is too little inspec@@ tor in the crop .
is it only available at the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely that is why a consistent explanation of such events and the commit to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences may be of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times that I expect a seamless explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumer officials and consumers have the right to be used exclusively safe and transpor@@ table foods .
if a non @-@ asset insec@@ ti@@ cide used in the food industry are consumer officials and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged .
the disp@@ ens@@ ed means are manufacturers , traders and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide f@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities , that the fac@@ tual contents is rapidly and completely elu@@ ci@@ zed .
how does the financial regulate of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim at preventing un@@ inhi@@ bited issues of European football stadium , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A because the leading organisation that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A &apos;s life means that PS@@ G may eventually prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without any major losses .
Barcelona has 2@@ 22 million euros paid to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make the money easily , so that N@@ ey@@ mar signed up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich gl@@ ories of Qatar .
clubs may withdraw a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be controlled with legitimate objection , which allow them to break the break at the lati@@ tude in their on the football business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ki@@ ked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the amendment meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - has bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and to establish a global brand - to become a tougher affair .
during the current three @-@ year rule period that runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini was fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ a continues to shy away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its treaty .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that it can be dis@@ sol@@ vent for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a cash sentence of 60 million Euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of which normal 25 players remains limited .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to over@@ list their financial supervision by linking up their income by companies belonging to the owners of a club .
while a cat @-@ free company could transp@@ onder the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply as legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s value was applied by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar could come .
however , PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be mess@@ ed and a kind of maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , every attempt to consider the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , speak@@ est on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of EUR 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4 million .
the accounts for the final financial year have to be released .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature .
the Spanish League has clearly been irrit@@ ated , one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s directions by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s final ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state owned by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; L@@ ess said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different paths or have different interests if one country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier
in the past few years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was produced for Swiss Life .
now the s@@ cour@@ ing collabor@@ ates at a possible end : the airline writes the order new .
Swiss @-@ speaking in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed upon request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North @-@ West of Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning the Air@@ line will include a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed all two to three years and have undergone a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small rot@@ or pack@@ aged sho@@ gg@@ it@@ af@@ eln are spread over 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
at the expense of the costs , Swiss Life wanted no information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry in@@ si@@ ders appreciate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros @-@ daughter produces an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however important is always the adver@@ t effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
like many applicants there is for the new tender , Swiss will not reveal .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to work out a renewal of the contract for the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not accessible for an opinion .
Cho@@ col@@ ate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss dra@@ fted a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility to place the logo led Swiss two years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class with treats can be spoiled by the Con@@ f@@ erie jumps , in Business Class passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
in addition , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and in Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia is in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ old the Sk@@ et@@ ch Com@@ edy &apos; for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd came to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodiment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would close .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a promising d@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by entering the core of the day - actor middle ages play vacc@@ inated children who will grow , they still manage the im@@ possibility to win the final part of the Wit@@ ch .
&quot; ten Years &apos; later , with its grown @-@ ups which are now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy continues after the G@@ ie@@ der principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at a point , a character from an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity still not lost .
and there is another crazy mali@@ cious pl@@ lot which is included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ classes are the best part of the franchise .
it makes a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ airy In@@ li@@ ppen@@ beard of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the moments of random madness , which could use this franchise , like a kind of repeated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which I can see as its logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last scene will show that which will visit the film premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : at the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West ring fight I@@ kon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , who have a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main tro@@ lling - a hard @-@ pil@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are synchron@@ ized .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice walks for watching ( the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often like a single one .
for six long episodes , the com@@ edy runs out , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could deliver better , since Greg@@ ory and Io@@ z@@ sef still visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who have a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the well @-@ conceived Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a laughter .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police took a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched out numerous objects as the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 sentences were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and had already issued an arrest warran@@ t against them .
moreover , the officials secured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators participated .
overall , more than 300 polic@@ emen were used in use .
the members of the Mafia is organised crime criminal , severe violence , fra@@ grant murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the prosecution Con@@ stance against the organised drug trafficking in the South @-@ German region has been determined .
between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a patho@@ gen and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore the big effort on the mid@@ day morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in doing so , the investigations of the investigations rests mainly Italian national ties with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , with early morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account .
fashion laments big gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not arise here &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious mis@@ choices in asylum procedures .
the meeting for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has drawn attention to a media report according to large gaps in the foreign @-@ country register .
defici@@ encies in the recorded data may result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ zing failure decisions , &quot; warned manner in an analysis that is called the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
in the register , the statements are reported to ten million people with foreign nation@@ als , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
in some cases , data of 1921 were found , &quot; by men who have long gone no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer exist in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entries can considerably slow back @-@ down processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it continues to the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU citizens are over@@ pol@@ ated by the EU citizens , who have not even had to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false dis@@ agreements led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government began to return to Italy to Italy with the 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this report out of an internal paper by the Federal Institute for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , report the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ dic@@ cker Newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it means that BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , the state can withdraw him back to the country of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate the post now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy made guarantees for inclusion and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) consider these promises to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU states would send refugees to this context in the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children dro@@ ph@@ s because of the shortcomings in the Italian Asyl@@ um system , human un@@ lawful conditions and a threat of childhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ line results reached
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach live up to other people already for other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens that were awarded the Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his now 100 children now divided up to 50 lit@@ res of blood .
traditionally , the municipality in the session of the Joint Council hold the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous as our body is created for it , and we ap@@ plau@@ d the don@@ ators who provide their blood for foreigners , still un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined Mayor Char@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood@@ shed helps several people , &quot; explained the county director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for preser@@ ves are dis@@ integr@@ ates into its components .
in this way three people could benefit from a bleeding .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K circuits .
obviously , the transition to the theatre house was led to higher cont@@ est@@ ants at a few years ago .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; jobs , &quot; when they put the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure .
the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in their quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 on 1.@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.@@ 6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal incoming would continue , whereby the inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years there would be zinc levels to grow the Bre@@ xit in secret inflation and she said that the credit card might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic power@@ ets which was issued a year ago after Bre@@ xit .
it will be time for funding for banks to provide cheaper financial resources for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate stated the bank : &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as pressure on real households remains stra@@ ined by consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ el@@ ation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount would be needed than markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets anticip@@ ates the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that cre@@ ases are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected in comparison to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecasts in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages on the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell at 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent un@@ betrayed growth figures increase the rising expectations on a zinc increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be at 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the latest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary Report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and minor evaluations since the tigh@@ tening first becomes even worse before it is getting better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added that monetary policy cannot prevent the income down@@ fall over the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecasts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be significantly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of lower consumption output . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pressure caused .
the Bank estimates that it will probably be four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
prior to the final verdict of the bank on the interest rates , the call has increased after a zinc increase , since inflation increased pressure on hard op@@ pressive households , with three political decision makers in July demanded an increase in 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will take them back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that over@@ stres@@ sing relative to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to assign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent set@@ back of the S@@ wap margins , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the len@@ ders would look forward to business and end the year in a positive way .
the market looks especially good for those in which the existing de@@ es run and completed the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to pres@@ cribe the controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse interven@@ ed prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) that can reduce the risk of infection in high risk of risk by about 86 percent , now delivered by health service by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he volunte@@ ered to finance the process after the Appe@@ al Court affir@@ med the ruling Court of Justice last year after the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; which announced on Thursday Chess Federation was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) this as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to enable the registration of people and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ exact prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection cases .
p@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come to the issue are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics the appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a medical specialist , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical trials , such as has been used in a large scale and is implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV and over@@ take HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
EP , if it is targeted towards needy and endangered people , the opportunity to change the British HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner which leads to improving many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP testing medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is appreciated for months long delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to ending the spreading of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the big life : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I searched for something that was similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first tour the 1,000 square kilometres was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a lav@@ ish layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add yod@@ elling space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
this was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end she was instructed the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , which was at 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another , so the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ anine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the pre@@ disposition .
&quot; the steel station is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were mess@@ ed over one another without having to for@@ ge us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this order allowed it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine is a classic copper light window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us across the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold tree , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let him work longer .
in the kitchen the mir@@ rors feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we were mir@@ r@@ ored units for all seating and glasses of yod@@ elling .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous room the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen , if it is not used .
composite tables are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a gar@@ ris@@ ome door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; it is not so important , so it is when you move the door very easily , very easily . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into the electrical plug in the walls .
these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a dispute because of one of the largest property imperialist Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
therein the family founded West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bulg@@ ans as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - of Paul as the &quot; chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis described - about two thirds of the company &apos;s power and Paul about one third .
a record states that this means that Col@@ in is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of € 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affair in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice last Friday .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims him out .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , some possessions of in@@ competent to manage .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to conf@@ use the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of law .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late @-@ he husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought the milk @-@ bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ 1990s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
you used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ing the family opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 did not hope her property re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated to her children .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ group , with Col@@ in claimed that Mark paid 10 million dollars by leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , so Paul &quot; says &quot; about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , though he was a former AF@@ L commander @-@ board and after a biography from 2015 , Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated in Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case before the courts is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , very sorry that my brother Paul has chosen to verk@@ usen , and to draw up our family names through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father had not wanted , that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , he added that he still hopes for a solution . &quot;
Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts &quot; Col@@ in wrote Col@@ in .
Tru@@ mp@@ s of new staff is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and they have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if yes , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more equ@@ itable course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new rod of the White House , at his first day of working with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wants to repair : poor information given to the President &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ amed Tru@@ mp by monitor their media .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now where he &apos;s in the White House , his television sets is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Candi@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media use contains a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter is ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something we didn &apos;t know - that Tru@@ mp@@ s twe@@ ets could have included even more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his employees had made it several times , ag@@ gra@@ vation of it , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented it , that Tru@@ mp controversy is generated .
part of the problem is that people in a white house , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may fo@@ sters their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ er to leading President of strategic reasons for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks and that he will find out how these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president mal@@ ign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tw@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy ro@@ c@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was ex@@ iled from Twitter to Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher adds that the president of Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive to influence .
these un@@ changing factors make cellars &apos;s mission very difficult .

travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ är@@ s series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on war trains , negotiated by the community of drawn dit@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were ki@@ cked out only in May without preventing a tren@@ ch dit@@ ch to prevent their accidents .
the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have afflic@@ ted the advice of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday , after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pas@@ sers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced by shame to implement , because when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably today still more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my church ends if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a community that didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridiculous , we just saw the last round of this trav@@ eller just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many inhabitants report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling for 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the Court needs to consider when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the Gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened again on March 1 , next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ hof by the then Ambi@@ ch@@ yard company will be approximately 30 000 nights per year , and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , given the dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees that came into the County , offered the hotel building of the land Council as a collective accommodation , which was provided for controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the installation of a development plan to ensure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disputed at that time in the con@@ vul@@ sion .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l Ober@@ salz@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke back then of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ isen@@ berg group with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ hof have been standing in front of the entrance for longer time , and when one enters the house , what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were removed , blankets to part ab@@ stain@@ ed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is surrounded , new windows are installed .
everything should be called &quot; beautiful bourgeois later &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ ter presses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one would not have to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ aller .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms would be set up wide , explains more .
both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause have already run , thus Sag@@ er@@ ers .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ ter will not want to specify exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outdoor facilities are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ affair : U.S. special presents Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair about US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special representative of Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a report called Grand Jury for a report .
the Panel has recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under calling on with the cause of familiar people .
the newspaper ra@@ ged the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller grew up his investigation and intensified .
the Sender CN@@ N reported it already give first sum@@ mon@@ ies of the Gre@@ mi@@ er in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
US intelligence agencies accused the Krem@@ lin for a longer time being specifically mixed up in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines , whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand in electoral campaign as consultants of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also reported more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special el@@ ter Tru@@ mp has put personally into the center and searched for the accus@@ ation whether the president could hin@@ dered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence of possible restra@@ int and decide whether it is to be charged .
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also referred to as acc@@ entu@@ ated chambers .
mostly they are switched on , when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Pro@@ secutor to charge people to the establishment under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement on which it was written in the report .
moreover , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. were Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ an election campaign Paul Man@@ afort at the meeting .
right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts said on Thursday evening in U.S. television that the suspension show that Mu@@ eller should not be intimi@@ dated in his work and that he should be if it should be necessary to act fast .
but it does not necessarily say that the Grand Jury will turn on the end to decide the survey of an indictment .
however , the suspension of the Gre@@ mi@@ um at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president ap@@ plau@@ ded a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign against his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else than they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er to T@@ y Cob@@ b explained nothing about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but these work also usually in the secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ated all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the earlier F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it is not determined against the President .
you have no reason to suppose that something changed on it , it says in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey was fired .
because of this r@@ arities , accus@@ ations were turned out against Tru@@ mp because he did not want to h@@ amp@@ er the judiciary .
in June , Com@@ ey said to a Senate Committee in June , Tru@@ mp asked him for a setting of the investigations against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of US @-@ media , the White House gathered material against the special officers and its employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dissolved spec@@ ulations whether to release Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike an independent special representative of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair concerning the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he might be dra@@ fted theoretically on the president of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators from both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented on Thursday legis@@ lators on Thursday , after which special obj@@ ections could no longer be released .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ice @-@ ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antar@@ ctic
in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice mountain is solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut für Polar@@ - und Marine Research on Wednesday .
the over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers big pist@@ on drive now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the biggest ice giants who have registered researchers over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not work from him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the quar@@ ry of the ic@@ eberg , is still unclear .
but in total , there have been a series of unusual collapse break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers this could be related to global warming .
the now broken pist@@ on was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is flo@@ ats to the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and goes regularly off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
just north of this cross @-@ fe@@ el@@ ises was the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rup@@ ting several years ago .
a complete Shel@@ f is there dis@@ assemb@@ ler , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
I &apos;m talking about that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front c@@ ann@@ als have never been as far withdrawn as at present .
moreover , the ice plate on tension and can be crus@@ hed , if at a key point a piece can dro@@ p@@ out .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , because they swim in the water and pushed ice as much water as it gives after f@@ use itself .
however , the loss of shame is causing the gl@@ aci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea , and much faster can be flowing as before .
this could possibly raise the sea level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project is writing the Antar@@ ctic of the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is based on AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the four @-@ biggest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the edge edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ov@@ shield is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of records &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he confirmed also . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will again grow again or in the long run , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers fall short of this gigantic ice cream not on climate change , so in the past few decades , there are many king@@ doms of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
this long peak of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone by around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus mat@@ ured to the areas where the temperature at the fastest growing .
CD@@ U aims to use Hau@@ sti@@ if at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U urge to step out of the employer @-@ association to be more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Krem@@ ist@@ ag has conquered 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day after themselves .
the cur@@ riculum in the circle are obviously very popular .
approximately 6@@ 20 App@@ lic@@ ants were to be noted for the places in this year .
however , the circle is lacking personnel to cope with the increasing demands and tasks .
currently , in the district M@@ ett@@ mann , there are still 50 vac@@ an@@ cies still in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as strengths of the general administration .
the CD@@ U should now take the initiative in Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG take the initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out at the request of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and recruitment development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the objective is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but forward @-@ looking for the application scar@@ city means it is .
the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ specific areas and involve an educational , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds already after a good approach .
for the circle has it to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know so far .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a down@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ ranging from the service comes out .
high time for action thus , so that even more places are un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Müller , Leader of the CD@@ U , deals with his party beyond the joint request .
he has long since taken a lazy surprise for a lazy surprise when he asked the personnel in question , and the other parties were astonished .
people want all the possibilities to be checked that allow an exit from the communal workplace association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the administration with the trade unions - maybe also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U to pay the employees and officials better than fores@@ ee the tari@@ ffs for the public service actually .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money there is only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented to professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms must be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ri@@ mp and Kreis@@ ky Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the sound to NGOs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NGOs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue @-@ rescue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they must not continue this if they do not comply with new rules on their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Marco Min@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ ese daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ret@@ ches &apos; because their crew collaborated effectively with people &apos;s hands in a way that ligh@@ tened illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to give detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian pro@@ secutor of Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion about social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all alleg@@ ations currently being collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had been running the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ es &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , supervised since October .
it is believed that its occupation is se@@ ash@@ y migrants to board migrants that can be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smug@@ gler can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Ak@@ te of the Public Pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is de@@ ple@@ ted to over@@ take over the authority of the Italian coasts , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motiv@@ ations .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have a Italian police officer on board who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been told to follow the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable , as they were not able to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their li@@ f@@ li@@ abilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates Organization doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy last few weeks , leading to the efforts of strengthening the Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali above measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
nine turn@@ outs bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two spe@@ ech@@ ists met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to spend four days in Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three free guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heim Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed lookout spots , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the prevalent levels .
in between there was always a long time sti@@ cking , for the long trig@@ gers .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s festival market .
once again , lookout spot at lookout spot , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
in the last two days many altitude metres were predicted .
caves , rocks , towers , fort@@ resses , ruins and rever@@ ts made welcome to welcome .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air condition cur@@ rant the bi@@ ker .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres the group had the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and culturally @-@ known .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in future in front of computer consoles , instead of being swe@@ ating in wind and weather over the stadium .
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , become an lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognised the first federal ga@@ ga@@ des which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department and took two professionals for the computer game of FIFA under the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire a brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Executive Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain that there are several associations on this train &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next weekend of FIFA World Cup FIFA will organize the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven qualified .
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 years , that young people are still going into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ess to Asia .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or just the soccer simulation of FIFA on the competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as is established in normal sports , le@@ agues , in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian @-@ 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about the right sport ?
for many , the performance is safe to use .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne is e @-@ sport a sport because he is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress levels , hormonal changes .
besides , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only take on the console , but also exercise their body and watch them on nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for playing online games , and in the scene missing the structures of classical sport .
positive empha@@ sizes the scientist the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a great global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study conducted by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Inter@@ aktive Online software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 we have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments .
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the soccer league this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already on .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez am US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ und Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe a lot is doing .
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ atic .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league clubs are under obligation to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany has lag@@ ging behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , it is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says also D@@ ome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot stick to it that only with football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Conrad Roy condemned to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to local currency .
Carter was condemned in June due to the neg@@ ligence of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy did in a psych@@ ic disease .
clo@@ th@@ ed in red pants and cre@@ amy bl@@ ouse , Carter , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ stairs eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; their actions did Conrad Roy , &quot; he said the pro@@ secutor to the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ry lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circumstance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their mind disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day on which I will not mour@@ n the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be pro@@ secuted from the realization &quot; she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth , is an pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts where it makes a crime to commit to others to commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon oxid@@ ation in one vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text releases revealed that she had encouraged him to finish his life .
&quot; hanging you up , Spring of a building , ste@@ eping yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many paths , &quot; she told in several news that she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that they should benefit from any press by the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x was part of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserve compassion and help , not a prison . &quot;
Joshua F@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run by the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern makes the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season to - Extra motivation does not exist .
something was different from his place in the c@@ ab , that looked Joshua for me right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philip Lah@@ m and no other Manuel Neu@@ er was to see him , he made himself the distributed t@@ amp@@ on to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not write it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as the Bayern captain .
good , the one could have been better run than with the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of Coach could indicate me so .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen by youth @-@ players , de@@ sp@@ ants and straight out of the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
sugar@@ s are also distributed most ende@@ aring to those who want to be a lot of we@@ ed , that you want to keep in mood .
those who are chosen , to join the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ atter the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right back , this is its position , the white bin@@ ds in the arm did its rest .
and at all I did in this starting formation like the one who can best take charge of the ruin .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ consistent tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vid@@ al therefore , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( til@@ ted hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches , to draw on the devil go out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus dis@@ missed in their first appearance in the Bayern tribute not negative .
this is all quite well .
Sü@@ le ran besides Kim@@ ber@@ ley , Ru@@ dy before the defense on , both agi@@ lied sovereign .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli girl often did so hard , in addition to trying to get c@@ utt@@ ony a few times even in the game @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy did not know that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but also he showed a decent performance at the debut .
writing , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria world is still used for the new arri@@ vals , one looked at the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two , but destined for six or seven interviews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ im@@ ed me , after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from South Africa an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what goes here now I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just need to win every game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one .

company happy with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ arian minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor economic ministries of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is evident after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economics ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old secretary .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Tri@@ er Group ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the desires of the economy to all the Lem@@ ke shel@@ ters . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the nu@@ is@@ ure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer au stands up in the pri@@ est@@ rian list of the country now .
this year the Ministry is still hoping for a plan of plan , up to 2021 the building is supposed to be correct .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the Wes@@ er Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need of the federal government .
the goal is to take the circuit in December 2020 , says Prime Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us looks at it a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to be seen by Wis@@ dom , in the wine of the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label , in order to increase the sales volumes in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to start up their own company , pra@@ ises the HK version .
the Chamber of Commerce Tri@@ er sees an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided is a premium rate of 1000 Euro for the stock test and 2500 Euro if graduates are constantly working within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road building , be quickly facts to create , at the same time l@@ acked the country to the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , chief executive director of the HK Tri@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 56 new engineers who wants to set mobility in the state of the state , so far only 29 points are occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U fraction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting station , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in receiving inland roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
so@@ ber@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band structure in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the PS@@ U in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3.4 .
you are compl@@ aining of ground @-@ floor internet connections and break@@ downs .
the ex @-@ economic Minister of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out at the moment out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private college organised in Karlsruhe - where after four months of in@@ consistency , the field has already returned the field .
Audi is to change 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , installations to install the neutr@@ alization of the exhau@@ sts of diesel vehicles to install , take also what it is difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but driving for normal driving conditions .
several employees were indicted in the United States , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in Germany in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities of Audi accused the system installed to circum@@ vent the emission regulations in Europe and a request that focused on the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be heavy burden : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the grief
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most widely published carto@@ ons carto@@ ons , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
with 85 the Argent@@ inian stands still and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he turned himself among other things as a sign of luck for lucky cards - what led him frustrating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my career was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s made him the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
and again the artists of the cities are inspired .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mon@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ or@@ ting in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing time even today , working almost ten hours a day .

la@@ ven@@ der threatened by Provence on climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the dis@@ appearing conditions and because of the disease transmitted insects , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to find big headaches .
Eric Cha@@ ins , expert of the agrarian research institutes CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender of Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring , and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ wire , and with very dry weather , there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly sought for per@@ fume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ ins said : &quot; instead of having very long plant @-@ pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration out of the ground , but also the audi@@ ting of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the Städt@@ chen Ge@@ isa in the Thr@@ acian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval .
cro@@ ws , cent@@ ru@@ ms , traders , vag@@ ant or a country camp should be experienced in the city center at these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take up their children with the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or they leave them at home .
security experts have written three words to a black@@ board on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and stomach @-@ bearing .
there are drugs smug@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspi@@ ci@@ d to stand on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no hibernation by the violence , and while throughout the country there are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to have res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs .
his absence is felt deep though its presence is everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; is hanging at the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce @-@ building . two porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ uth .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared subjects , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was established a Son@@ et Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office in order to edit the cases of journalists , it initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the committee &apos;s protection .
as with most thousands of murder that are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put on trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist that the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a must be treated even though they are in@@ tra @-@ eastern and although the terrain is still tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why we distr@@ ust all of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez abandoned the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to walk around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but to the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and the ex@@ tradition of the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ e@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are struggling to fill a vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of produced , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ es for drug royal who are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el in control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States has .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understandings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing group fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , pres@@ ump@@ tive gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was about to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he was active in 2003 as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the smoking d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
with the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of dis@@ courage and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising took place .
re@@ porter loved it to publish very tough investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship and readers were intrigu@@ ed by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one otherwise dar@@ ed to handle .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history .
he voluntarily gave him that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug store in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task which will be assigned to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many students ... why did you not say what went before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to cur@@ b the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survived .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his guard .
he would always go to El Guay@@ an@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there on the same table .
now they wonder : was his love of routine his ruin ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing strips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
his own instinc@@ ts trust .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; odor is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happens with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - as did in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees met by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively on governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were protected against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were the governor himself as un@@ trustworthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters went to the mountains where the drug gangs have de facto under control .
for the edition of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has flo@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known box@@ ers Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the city &apos;s hometown .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass , so caution was advisable when it was time to write , what every one in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite one of drug hands and authorities .
a re@@ porter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a poli@@ cem@@ an , which ruled the ruling Institutes Party Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the entire century all political levels .
recently , several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused due to high @-@ quality cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man departed a military assault .
only a few months before , the reader would have seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers who protest against the Mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ ap@@ sed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
in the whole country journalists have become sound@@ ing that they organized in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking paths and constructions .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to raise international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and release them , because they told the truth .
she has since asked that she is re@@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surround &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials and a simultaneous society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug gangs but also by the command of politicians and security guards dealing with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because they want you to watch the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody is forgetting the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas de Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ style and ear@@ phones positioned next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as es El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are flying out of their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted down , as it seems to be murdered with the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who remain back and continue the work , there is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , is that the drug trafficking frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat down on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to reach .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ed v@@ alen and security guards near the bathing resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues escal@@ ated , as it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phones .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ene he@@ els near to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a view on the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they showed it not .
under the enormous portrait of the Fallen Fo@@ under of the newspaper , the middle @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its tracks .
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day , on which Javier was murdered , the practic@@ ant me asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used to so@@ ak its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker got so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his rose skin from red@@ dish Braun was - and they said they had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to as &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ ly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r that ever was found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period of between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserved condition has researchers who describe it as a &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed crop @-@ e@@ aters is the best preserved fossil by its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed from the surrounding rock at the plat@@ ze , and decided to see more exactly .
he discovered Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 Po@@ unds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ ers .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen .
&quot; it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs copies - the mono@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this crop @-@ eating , although he is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably by meat fres@@ hen din@@ ers .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology , which is known as a counter@@ part which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines in May for the first time and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ s@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ mi@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ours over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ding , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter@@ ing is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted enough pressure by meat fres@@ her dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution gained the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that apply the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras and gir@@ ly animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ r show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was rot@@ ten .
scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ vent Dar@@ min@@ ated to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as South Americ@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ ff@@ au@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with counter @-@ four skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the beast maintains &quot; Brown &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes of shame , you might think that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ y din@@ ers , who stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the King of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons he@@ avier monsters .
the scientists , their latest findings in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , seem to believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ ed after death in the sea and was converted to mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the animated dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were weigh@@ ed on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ fres@@ ser was w@@ ailed by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cut@@ out of the dinosau@@ rs kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bump@@ y arm@@ or plates along the dinosau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a win in the Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remn@@ ants of the skin still cover the bump@@ y arm@@ or plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his left front lies on his side , his five fingers are moved up .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ ts on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous ver@@ tices , kilometres long st@@ ints - and G@@ aff@@ er .
at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich highway ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people have been wounded on the late Thursday morning .
according to the first information from the police there were between 17 : 00 pm between the Connec@@ t@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm : 30 cars , among them probably also trucks .
about the exact number of closures initially not provided information .
it is a light to moderate @-@ severe injury , said a poli@@ cem@@ an issue .
a large elev@@ ot on ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich there was a ten kilometers long drive .
as a AZ @-@ re@@ porter reported , it also came on the way to massive disabilities - through numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire@@ fighter is listed the mark@@ ers of the vehicle , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , the second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car otran@@ smit@@ ters and a car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group premi@@ er &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creation and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ha@@ ft or im@@ ent the passenger in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket control .
but the times of rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test the acquisition card control .
one simply confirms the phone that you have taken place and de@@ valu@@ ations the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the railway is called the card type without work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers already .
you have to also bought it via the App of the train , the DB Navigator software , which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seating reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers then appears a button on the electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction guides get on their mobile devices a message that chassis X has taken on the train and taken the seat Y Y Y .
comes the train manager at the map control to square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already contained online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , keep on , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; who relax@@ es relaxed without ticket control by our train service , checked in the DB Navigator just yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB Cor@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives train , knows that besides delays and pas@@ siv@@ ated the ticket controls belong to the biggest health results .
because often you have yourself , in any case , one of the fellow travelers do not need any documents that you need to make online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any document is missing either .
the consequence are endless discussions between tractor and driving groups , leading to bad mood in the section or large space and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the activity at the end of time to worry about other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart meals .
further traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; it was there .
confused , as no one else had posted the information on their feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly available on her tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was here , the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white poli@@ cem@@ an in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed to twe@@ et live .
he po@@ ked a picture of brow@@ n@@ le@@ blo@@ ous body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; that is so wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she was watching a live @-@ feed at which a poli@@ cem@@ an stood before a group of demonstrators with a rebel@@ li@@ ous dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , ref@@ uted another poli@@ cem@@ an of his gun and crying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that is not custom@@ ary , &quot; Fer@@ rell was reminded of her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can be typical of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt the bulk fro@@ st .
I was angry and crying . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinemas from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , the strength and the resistance , that consists of the point of view of the human being , who live in the community and have filled the streets to find answers .
as a Fer@@ rel with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning , &quot; above the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not remember how to fight you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reminded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not bring them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the various layers of the black experience and of the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves free .
even though I am lucky enough to give her a experience , in which they personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling that I would have a bad service to keep it away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when she arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place towards the police authority that became a camp area , when the activists waited for the event@@ ual non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner .
they prepared pockets before and helped to pass them to demonstrators .
slowly began to take up a new kind of activ@@ ism for fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating fairness and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comra@@ de Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into meaning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by men - in a community that benef@@ itted from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as follows in an interview recently explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up in their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism by To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt .
his involvement brought about the project closer together with six other natives followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; over the years after browsing experience .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , because I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the strongest cont@@ est@@ ant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ vor life , as she fell in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is history repeated the role of black swe@@ ow@@ ls women in the broader Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as sul@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have worn the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay men must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; at the Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is no coincidence , even though it was at the front line , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much on the game .
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police are continuing .
Fer@@ rell is at a demonstration for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ade of a highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , she cl@@ ashed a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern part of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its since the first presentation 2009 the population prop@@ onents and opponents .
cold lets the issue hardly be able to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s friends and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while one of the bit @-@ to @-@ gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi bed@@ bugs ) or simply plain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advocates are building that a Gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which also benefit from the other business , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct @-@ bleeding .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm market hall stands , where 13 direct market or marketed their products .
with the start of construction work it will be possible .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - at the Bed@@ a square with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying a weekly market hall for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always very happy .
also the but@@ cher we discovered for us too .
we would like that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct or marketed in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many stores are left here - some have been here for months and years .
but since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that at least to receive us at least the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered there is freshly offered , mostly directly from the producer and is ob@@ fin@@ ely reasonably priced .
as you can see , shop shops will be rented in a shopping center only by larger firms , as the dor@@ ms are often not viable for a retailer .
shame , special transactions are almost no more and what is still left , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits not for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where should the farmers market hall during the building time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery actually occurs .
or does it manage to drive the Ges@@ pen@@ st Bit Gallery previously , all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping centre , which is empty , does not need any one .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant hall , I give it a lot - like I think - point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no more space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the peasant market hall was broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portrait of Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ on and hair@@ cut , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st had a 35 year old prison sentence , after she made public messages about the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website publicly .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2nd August is A Be@@ becoming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline was united to their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gres@@ sional and pioneering discrimination , whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by the algorithms analysis of DNA which could be extracted and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with these genom@@ ic data could look a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ated De@@ termin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been talking openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 violations of the Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Act , computer dec@@ eption and theft .
through the prison , her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that it was only a single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white r@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ ted blonde with which she has been associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; stranger &apos; .
in this , the artist portra@@ yed portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette smoking and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press show of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their de@@ tain@@ ted M@@ use were ex@@ propri@@ ated to unequal letters , which are inter@@ changeable in the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; suppor@@ ter Images , &quot; who fores@@ ee a future in which the president of Chel@@ ation would convert judgment and she was able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military court in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of bl@@ iss@@ ful coincidence .
in the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp have a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops , to find new , twe@@ eter ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions , which he actually should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in a written artistic statement , he called for Mann@@ ing with her over@@ big signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) having an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ opo@@ lies of Cs and GS , and As , in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped that by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ cl@@ o@@ tide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) show how amazing , at least in biological sense , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , can also be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she comes up with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in his hand from the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ kas@@ barracks of the United States such as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your speech , then they won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came right from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ese when I speak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as is anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ras that relate to hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped to Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of killing sought
a nationwide strike is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were sought out as susp@@ ects , after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been sto@@ cked with deadly injuries .
on Monday were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ t because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , such as the brief@@ ing of the Cook County .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
a report published by the police authority of Chicago published in the treas@@ ury system that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim of several injury to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained at the place of the action for dead , and det@@ ective investigate the stit@@ che as murder , while the police seeks actively looking after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them@@ self since 2007 is exceptional professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ans , the Vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ ish may now be un@@ ra@@ ging and excluded from the beg@@ ging of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is studied by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explanation that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain in contact and ready to help the U.S. inquiries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that warm colleagues were shocked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said : he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; the police have a notion of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the property manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ish and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic demonstration . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ deputy Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ deputy Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , I won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause Russia to concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada presented in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria referred to in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian Law Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly accept dop@@ ing dop@@ ings in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system got a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ated words voted against those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian outlets R@@ sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has faced this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov added .
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of implementing dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA declared itself &quot; in the right direction &quot; moved to be used again .

in addition to the s@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies arrive to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since then a former employee has published a blog post , who describes an environment of Bel@@ ä@@ sti@@ tions , in which those who have spoken , pen@@ alized .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the global governance , regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , after the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behaviour saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
he recently signed up as a client .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how G@@ lin@@ t , can you send &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pol@@ ls to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employee to report in bad behavior .
and when the main business leaders are included , they go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion investig@@ ates regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his employees are treated badly or are un@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers fluctu@@ ation and cl@@ usal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , Conver@@ ters has been employed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company conver@@ ts Conver@@ cent , problems that were previously identified by executives , hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or imp@@ acting practitioner - faster identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience dealing with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and staff members in 2002 after having collap@@ sed the accounting company Arthur Andersen for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors , which both assisted start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million for financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital has risen to $ 47 million .
it won $ 10 million in November from Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , in view of the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assignments .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that pays off their voices , and that the work you are doing is worth it , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience on Link@@ ed@@ In , which both conver@@ ters and g@@ lin@@ t .
investors achieve ren@@ ders when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well if employees are using and involved .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employees &apos; commitment is important to the experts of the work @-@ culture .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed any dis@@ appointments and po@@ ign@@ ments .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen it very much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow our employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom do you not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who is now performing monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported by G@@ lin@@ t , so re@@ tt .
and after collecting feedback from frustrating staff , she was able to re@@ organize new decision @-@ making and quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always get new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry which is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose clients .
and if you lose clients , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ges
a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn up their tri@@ p@@ ups and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good portion of the team , these non @-@ classes represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses are returned after the three @-@ hour exercise at their audi@@ ts before they return next morning at 6 : 30 am to the water man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ges @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was arrested .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed tim@@ esp@@ aces of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood at the beginning of the camp was moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should hold off 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he ass@@ ay the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add further points to the multiple times of players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremendous burden three or four days on it and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they are continuing , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really magnificent . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices once the camp is finished , what was raised in the face of the clear sightings of his fields by an adjoining car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been covered with foot@@ ball@@ ots , which will be a protective network behind a p@@ pole , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ ins players will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and from a exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ sch@@ received from third party reports and show their results from the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest online social network will be on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so called F@@ ake News .
the company said in an opinion on his website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false feedback and sending them to the fact that may display results from the original article checking out of the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe they have also influenced the US presidential election by 2016 .
the problem also has become a major political issue , whereby the French voters have been flooded in advance of the presidential elections in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks are to be punished when they didn &apos;t succeed to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday Facebook said in a separate explanation in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany started a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to finding , what stories of fact @-@ audi@@ ted third parties are challenged , people want to make more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; linked article &quot; and working on other changes to his news fe@@ eds to decrease false news .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a hiding place for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ 10 years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat at the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and now is now an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a cosmopolitan city of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ one with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said we@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; embr@@ aced the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project which he was unexpected emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b button on the side of a letter , who was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 &apos;s years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always cried to smoke ; for at that time , one burned a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have survived my welcome pack a little over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that seems to be all too beautiful to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ do spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ bri@@ des heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the premises and ruins of the old castle and talked with Land@@ scape hosts , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key , and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was first received full access than the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rhodes was a decade later , the employees first began to worry about the archive he referred to as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , enter@@ f it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps showing who possessed what : &quot; you might think that country @-@ conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to have fought the two families .
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge on a foot@@ er base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who built the newly built castle to join the peasant centre of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record from a turmoil that came in 13@@ 80 in the castle in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; began in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ iten@@ ist , hidden the Dar@@ rell family seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , in which the smug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who filled his own funer@@ al by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was buried only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen will almost certainly be going to debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men dissolved their debt crises by offering rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote revenues . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences .
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ sm@@ iles behind it , the terrain of a san@@ ity from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle eng@@ eng@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city Bad Honnef am held its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team about Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August it should be the highlight of the campaign a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; the makers of the action since yesterday appeared on the posters by the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) does not really think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we firmly believe that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer will probably know about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action , it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all@@ est promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a mid @-@ digit amount will be charged the city in Bad Honnef its new roof brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s fear of army
every year in the beginning of August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) of pen@@ sion@@ ers and transport operations in the officers &quot; officer .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine of the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
the meeting did not take place in the office of the Staff College , as formerly , but was the prime minister of the Prime Minister .
in the proceedings , under the presidency of the Government , the five vice @-@ han@@ re@@ ers , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
these were the civilians in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government moves to the military in the military .
Chief homage to Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air @-@ workers and the nav@@ y were dra@@ ined .
since the failed Cou@@ p has fired President Erdogan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdogan as a wire @-@ pull of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 subjects , which should be directly involved in the coup test , is being negotiated in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the overthrow as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really really control the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the General Staff , I give concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which is manifested among other things in the lifting of the pil@@ ing ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the major event in the army and the security forces at any rate continues .
in the middle of July , Erdogan has a decree of other 7@@ 3@@ 95 state workers , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
thereby it seemed like Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als began earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times , they responded to their role as a guardian of worldly state order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his election victory , Erdogan is urged the power of the military to move forward , not least under calling on the reform of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former officers , Erdogan is targeted on the Islam@@ ization of the Armed Forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a named officer named after the coup try out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meets this , such development could not be cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ge in the occupation of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
it looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a limited working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by going to change the way the citizens from other countries of green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
source wants to cover route for racing
over and over again , over the past few months the future of the race track has been tried - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
still before the end of the year , at the mar@@ o@@ den track , on which the tourist track goes , are built .
in order to safeguard the future of the race track in the long run , according to the transportation of the Federal Ministry , Germany will be scheduled to begin on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further and to re@@ use , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated transportation secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repairs of the route covers about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , will currently be final , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the South @-@ Scotland as an operator will already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the roadmap that tra@@ ded vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the parent company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race shuttle shuttle will be regular on December 2017 .
the race shuttle is one of the main rail links between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot company , whether the route is used by plenty of people to order them again in the future .
the track is also very colorful in parts .
the rise of sex robot is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it can not be crazy here in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex @-@ robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robo@@ tik ) ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ alised professor of Robo@@ tik and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their climb seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves fun over them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robo@@ tic partners with a silic@@ on skin , which feels warm to the touch - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adapt its robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ colour of the robot to the type of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possess a step@@ ford @-@ woman to be progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen has developed into robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing as , for example , sh@@ utter .
and then there are the wor@@ m@@ sp@@ y developed Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; who conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ utter and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an adventurous personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; black@@ war@@ med the site of True Con@@ sp@@ y .
so it may seem what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired in conversation , or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ stit@@ uting female properties , the att@@ achments to rape , when one goes one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : contradic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , very quiet one at most .
on his website True V@@ ion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their appearance and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture , at a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission to an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots and while the FR@@ R re@@ alizes their increasing popularity , they still stay temporary at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ating out of the edge @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange , abu@@ sive , until they give permission to the free market .
there is some over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots exist in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House which is bo@@ iled to have women sexually attacked .
the most deter@@ red aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical pictures , the sle@@ ep@@ ed body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the objective behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want it to feel human that they im@@ itate the motion of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
they have no placement or background history , nothing that points to independence or anything that could dis@@ rupt the fantasy of total submission .
expressed in other words : they are fake slaves .

Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human being
it has become a bin@@ der of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US constitu@@ ency , also families in small format .
around Christmas and harvest feast , there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Tru@@ mp if you are horror .
we are all supposedly invited to bur@@ sting our filter bub@@ bles .
to have been noticed , the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a centre @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone , whom she knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for centuries because of politics , suddenly and very peculiar at the same side .
in order to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a wider context that this brings considerable risks with itself .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the decl@@ ining effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that one day could no longer be rep@@ tile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even start@@ ling long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tru@@ mp Republi@@ can &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of neg@@ ligence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ancest@@ ral version of the ma@@ d@@ ded - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach who saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both occur in comparison to Tru@@ mp in fact one than very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be just mentally to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cy@@ linders - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are revol@@ ve to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music comple@@ ments this in strange manner .
so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings will become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
but the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , because here two two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 years can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to tip the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing down of what actually ought to be an neutral replacement but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was apologi@@ zing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with Bre@@ ache from the prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wr@@ ists , which he had suffered the prison authorities in one case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned to an appeal of pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first total attack .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ toria on her feet .
Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der that hidden in the c@@ ab .
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their purpose , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , from which they say they are too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national law enforcement authorities said that it will raise a statement by the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa and the objection could be heard in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence increased over 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ quarters from F@@ itt@@ arius and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and at the continued schools .
three of the kid@@ nap@@ pers go to the grammar school in the future , four to the real school .
Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des , a young eag@@ les , who grows up at the chicken farm , but still released into the freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to do this , the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and allowed it to bro@@ w from his chicken .
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick a little eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken , cutting himself , the eagle spread on a high mountain his wings and escaped .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the di@@ version of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the Hen@@ nen danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder bore to the bet .
the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ leit@@ ner Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but they belong to this .
but he never will be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wished for all four @-@ quarters that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed Dan@@ ces to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who is always jumping again in teaching staff , and the parents representatives .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , stated class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher .
they leave their pupils after two years of teaching only very often , because it had been a really great time .
after all , they can rely on the four @-@ quarters .
at the end all students got a song of summer time and holiday season .
the children had great joy in the children .
for the new school year eight first @-@ bro@@ o@@ ons are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested by illegal camping in Greece
two Bulgarian ones were de@@ tained for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of the 1st of August , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police a group of illegal refugees , including the two bul@@ gar@@ en .
on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation is running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians later released .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free Camp@@ s and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant pen@@ alties .
the controls are continued during the whole season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine sentence .
software update for diesel cars : what the sufferers now need to know
how exactly is the software update instead of ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for around 5.2 million cars .
these are intended to improve the gas @-@ behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europe announces estim@@ ations :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .
&quot; the compulsory updates are only valid for the cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the retro@@ fit has arranged the power drive ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a strong implementation in the coming months , but no exact date is mentioned .
Daimler has communicated to write any person concerned .
if anyway , an inspection is due , it will be done in their frame .
how long are the requirements to be taken altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ering the autom@@ akers on the topic of environment so far is not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are drivers doing car driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE is waiting for indul@@ gence .
presumably to attract foreign manufacturers , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where the bot@@ tling is threatening .
in the rural area there are so far no added loss for older diesel .
the ACE advises , with a sale yet to be seen .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award

the winners with progressive TV @-@ series announced Le@@ ar today announced that it &apos;s already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to fully neglect the arts and human rights - even the means of depri@@ ving them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify their view .

we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to pension in the coming year .
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are scar@@ rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister
and the work is still great fun as he teaches in the press talk .
he tells of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time wondered , that so far no application asks the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next time .
this should be - taking into account the regular period of notice - not yet enough time for a review .
since Has@@ l@@ ach does not function for the administration as a sub@@ ordin@@ ative authority , the applicant must reject corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill this out , the citizens would have to drive up to Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , citizenship may be important to the city and himself , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good working environment , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in office more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects on the agenda : re@@ designing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ n@@ fen@@ park@@ platz .
the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium of stadium is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat some 1.5 million euros in bu@@ che , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all are great tasks for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
medi@@ cally required for a city construc@@ et@@ aker large room for man@@ oeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gar@@ dener could be responsive to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is standing as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ forcing &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the gru@@ ent city master .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ chery is high responsibility .
he is a fabri@@ cated , &quot; in the end everything is running here above my table . &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deepest construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , wish W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identifies you and wants to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Roland W@@ acker would like to tell you about the town of Has@@ l@@ ach , a complete degree of studies as a diplom@@ at or Bachelor , with technical architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning .
the municipal office stands high and deep construction , construction planning , s@@ field planning , administration of urban property , municipal court yard with construction yard and urban centers , as well as sub@@ ordin@@ ating protection authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on the lines thrown : South @-@ tram is blocked
according to the police , the formerly known perpetr@@ ator has thrown the blue bike of the rail@@ road transfer in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) into the cables .
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male offen@@ ders and look for the night hours after them .
near the scene , the witnesses were a ros@@ ary rolling and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ d , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the A@@ PA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have put themselves in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant as well as the delays and costs of the rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ als of rail customers could also go to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , which could be guided on the road transport across the South Side without disability .
almost ten person@@ ists were Friday afternoon , two of them considered the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ es were not falling away , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged some 200 meters of over@@ lines .
the insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammation )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the un@@ treat@@ able condition , affecting in the US around 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes ga@@ stri@@ fe and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected , meat and dairy products are normally given to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ kommen that contributes to the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins that contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leit@@ ner researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immun@@ cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , who hide themselves in the body , not penetrate into the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without har@@ ming sensitive tissue .
when the equilibrium gets too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments was found that a type of tolerance conve@@ ying immune cell on mice occurs that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the elements of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food they had , the more they had of these immune cells .
he suggested that the combination of L. rep@@ u@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ il , when the same system also holds on people .
the post@@ doctoral researcher in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a type of immun@@ o cell that re@@ alizes the tolerance when it turned out that a group of degree program drivers had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe but that was not accommodated .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ologists had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the har@@ ms of mice were sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without it out with mice .
mice were raised in an ster@@ il@@ ous environment so that they did not develop an intestinal micro@@ bial and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria eff@@ ecting the immune system , the researchers were able to grow in a liquid , and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from mice .
the immune @-@ cells developed into a tolerant cells .
as the active component of the fluid has been puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ites which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers re@@ doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. &apos;s reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. rep@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high trac@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius . &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening to S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million Po@@ unds Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the holder role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira according to expos@@ ures .
but MA@@ TIC was eliminated from the prepar@@ atory @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which had to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic rigid was also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , start the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still had three further commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; three of his four priority commitments .
&quot; three of four to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier when they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. manufacturer @-@ maker Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state Washington , but the drawing began in mar@@ qu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the mould of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising before .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo was painted in the sky .
new attack for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still spoke to the SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections always looked after a certain concern to Berlin .
only a stur@@ geon out of the party leadership , just no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - was the most important wish of the electoral fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed radically .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ Brandt observe the events of the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus with increasing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described as an approach to the approach .
there were frozen .
one after another .
the federal government @-@ CD@@ U following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not reliably rule , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising question of the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Land@@ tag , his red @-@ green Coalition lost its a @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ ens Michael Kellner has prompted the ab@@ ad@@ ful Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ cia El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west to return its mandate .
the over@@ comes to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west must immediately return its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Board of Business Administration and Elec@@ tions of the Green Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ls an SPD @-@ electoral fighter , as on Friday afternoon , the new Hi@@ obs@@ cur@@ ity Party reaches the party key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , re@@ assur@@ ing himself the comrades @-@ time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia everything will be different .
this was then too - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Tau@@ ride , which Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te has smooth the party .
lab@@ ori@@ ously the comrades in the weeks thereafter again .
then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next storm came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD @-@ chief , lost his Nim@@ bus in the weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did pretty much wrong in the crisis communication according to what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z fights his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Ab@@ car@@ bure@@ tor and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a longer time .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , Wei@@ l tried to get stronger in the federal acc@@ ents over the past few weeks .
the aim of the former civil master of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , comrades not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they let him grant him because they agreed to stabil@@ ise the party in Wei@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the exact opposite could arise .
in doing so , Wei@@ l takes no fault in the party &apos;s internal constraints .
and Schulz is not at all .
sometimes the comrades try to close their own ranks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the female parliament@@ arians in the Mid@@ west . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , such as Mrs. T@@ ests present their own careers over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party &apos;s left in the SPD member states , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS T@@ sar is not elected because of her person as direct can@@ did@@ atin but has been elected by the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Party continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD member states , laments a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate plays four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as a top priority in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career opportunities of a future CD@@ U @-@ MEPs de@@ fies the vote result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the background to clear up the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been ongoing commitment to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .

who wants to be ready in the coming house can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg city development received in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the previous event .
since 1991 it has been in delicate re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
at least 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the former sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only opening new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government of the Karlsruhe on April 4 that there will be a refurb@@ ishment field III .
the funding sum is 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which more than 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the municipality .
how do a refurb@@ ishment area arise ?
one will continue to investigate as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area of all interest up@@ lifting .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also be postponed .
the jet@@ ty stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program , where the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
core of the programme are the revit@@ alisation of internal cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the refurb@@ ishment would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding will run since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
even until September this year , however , it would only once again be conducted through inventory , within the framework of which the parties involved receive a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign should be made , so that the coming year will be started with the refur@@ bish@@ ments .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each commune must carry out the said pre @-@ investigations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban jun@@ ctions and decide when to be sanc@@ tioned and to what extent .
there will be also a re@@ organisation in the basic textbook for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires to be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it covers the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about the size , division and residents of a living area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill out if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
additionally , new construction measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funds after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind @-@ dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , hor@@ ts first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end still photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the presence a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor itself uses a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand@@ set in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a towel .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ payers thousands
the decision of the White House , a Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter to fly to the South Law@@ n for an event that highlights American production last month , tax@@ payers have been left to the information of the military , who have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the center@@ piece of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American architecture programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leaders of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter @-@ made helicopter was exhibited next to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ fighter from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fr@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter flight to S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , deputy naval commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter took place on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South Law@@ n for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn were vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the working hours a second team would need for the flight back .
the original flight was during the event during the helicopter , while security personnel remained during the time on the ground by plane .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear if ultimately a second flight response was required .
the H@@ atch Act has nation@@ alized , public property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; said the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and were not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was in the Senate , and he rehear@@ sed the efforts to con@@ tainment the government regulation .
the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but use their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February than the presidential plane in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states will show that of American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew perform frequent training trips in the area around Washington and in South Law@@ n through to comp@@ ose the US President in the White House with precise me@@ ter@@ rains .
at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was in the White House 58 exercising land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event mat@@ tered during the training needs of the air@@ cut for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ium units in addition 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were introduced at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in putting the helicopter at the South of Law@@ n .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain a budget for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D kit for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter length is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ payers is based on estimates for re@@ funds , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 included the revenue values for DO@@ D not the personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract degree .
at this time the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ agna , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ reads .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go from that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he joined his tour across the South Law@@ n for the event but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter car .
in the White House Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media on its own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rolle backwards : the town presents 46 kitchen aid
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ table itself .
with solid contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nursery centres , the watch is returned .
on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ gartens ( kite ) in equity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the field of youth , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked by house : a Cater@@ ina takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ co@@ ed cool@@ ed .
the city runs in the area of 46 kinder@@ gartens , in 44 the children get lunch time a warm meal .
in the last year , there were 2@@ 800 children in the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are looked after , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support when children remain until 14 p.m. CET . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ time professionals have from 1st September kitchen service : you get the gro@@ omed food , complement them by salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the meal out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as the seventh facilities - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistant are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because for this reason it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s team is very useful .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important to the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be completed by special cleaning personnel in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has turned out of the cost between self @-@ control and foreign use for the city as the economical choice , is to be out of the press department .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces will be re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours fall at some 750 people in the education area not as strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting Head of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women will run by the elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be truly representative and credible when women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GM@@ B concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to see himself at managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B Scotland said the company has shocked the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ by@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and trade union officials would like to experience the first if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ite of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concern that funding for modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM@@ B @-@ Senior Organ@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win a clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrated heavily on the local community and the Greater Region , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production rate at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ans at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to it , as we estimate the continuous engagement with employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , with which some questions were discussed openly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active in an extremely highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , check our business regularly - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . we should change our business flows at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La Liga likes their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t fade away in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to redeem their fre@@ ew@@ heel clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world tragedy ?
the sensational approach has heated the Trans@@ fer@@ ral window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world &apos;s record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans believes that the club has always been its best to take care of him since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but has been warned the football world three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all the clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players sign in , so this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded that line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that she would not allow it to escape International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

in the area of the town of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car was contrary to its lane , so that he had to go on to the right .

on the car there was no harm .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had a truck over@@ hau@@ led and continued its journey without worrying about the traffic accident .
it can be good according to the accident , that the Mer@@ z@@ czy@@ z@@ ists had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ report de@@ vised Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ report on the mis@@ bro@@ ws ab@@ uses pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the sc@@ andal@@ ous sc@@ andal among the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen provides further discussion .
Christian Weis@@ ering , spokes@@ man of the Re@@ public@@ ans &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would be the prestige of the Catholic Church to serve when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would be expressed deep informed about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however critici@@ zed that in the reporting of violence can be measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two things &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the trans@@ gres@@ sions in Regensburg has no doubt that it would have to be punished &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state of media manipulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the habit of call the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of all day experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis mean in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and this is a little fres@@ hen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a totally normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse attacks , often also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
completely wron@@ gly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who with R@@ atz@@ inger translated the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; written in 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment scientist Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases were used physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially for high emo@@ tion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe .
nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , there is a lot of victims , that in many cases , even in many cases , even positive memories with it . &quot;
in the interview Ez@@ emann explains why the final report was reli@@ eved in his opinion by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr Ez@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives an contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a lift , many students stand up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who has been able to make sure that a domain set was not a top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as its Bi@@ ograph ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : if you make the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger actually occurs in it .
he has just eight sites dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspected kill@@ ings or co @-@ awareness among the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the power of force at the pres@@ ch@@ ool is also un@@ sett@@ ling outside his sphere of activity .
you can don@@ ate it at best to get out of it too late or not take the initial hint seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; domain school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school , on which he worked , was felt by practically all the respondents - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes it as a &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who kept the guys regularly with cakes , biscu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ bons and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was re@@ tren@@ ch of the grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and his high popularity , which also has already led to wake @-@ ups .
that he not only threw with chairs and cast the key@@ chain on the ground , but also ear @-@ polish shared and too nau@@ ghty guys to his hair or ears , he has already given birth to years , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation has to be said , however , that such educ@@ ation@@ methods were widespread in the questionable time , the 1960s and 1970s , widespread , in parents like with teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asium .
compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the separation of violence at the pre @-@ school , admittedly are certainly dre@@ at@@ balls .
you ask yourself if it was not to do with his acquain@@ t@@ edness and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have just stor@@ med him .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , are still eager .
the truth is : the report ra@@ i@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , the report was much talked about by the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also put a load or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse to the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual trans@@ gres@@ sions claims to have entrusted to the domain master .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one man &apos;s acting deputy for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem in education about sexual abuse has been and is that most victims remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they are not familiar with parents and si@@ blings , then they are certainly not part of a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : one more frag@@ mented student form@@ ulating it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case , in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had been timely , and would have been able to have the respective offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really absurd , accept that any more urgent or more explicit or rather opened , as opposed to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , confidence instruc@@ tors , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to a very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students involved in advance could not be confirmed in the examination of the examination and / or their environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of all contributors .
thus , he cannot be accused of having him not prevented or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it was in some cases happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to read by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thrown away in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is precisely the abuse of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is therefore clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report describes incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral leader of the domain .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which Kn@@ aben of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were pushed and mal@@ ign@@ ited , and among them dra@@ ined , all went on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen und P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already standing on the school @-@ school @-@ school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , like most witnesses stress , the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vor@@ schule &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different in the domain of the school @-@ school ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : there has been discipline , but not just sa@@ di@@ sts of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims said the general humanity from R. , and therefore sometimes even positive memories with it in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most no longer remains the accus@@ ation to have taken away .
however , despite all efforts the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations at a school in which he had not worked and responsible ( such a witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
does George R@@ atz@@ inger rigor@@ ously follow the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ary for the report that the report was even reproduced .
in this he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool continue to practice the test . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in view of the danger of negative press representatives , he recommended an urgent entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was of course at a time when the legal clarity existed , when the test of Germany was banned from Bavaria too .
before that , she occurred in a legal grey area , just as everyone of us knows yet .
it was difficult for him to estimate how the people affected might have exaggerated or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded .
but one cannot say , he always would have looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards on the then time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Ez@@ emann : we can speak historians , from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus to evaluate the danger of past moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already been right .
but of course this applies not to sexual abuse , who was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken down in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence at inno@@ cent children &apos;s ri@@ mp@@ s , which already goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ chers and go to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s .
when physical punishment is then forbidden , he also strictly kept it in mind .
which image of his Regen@@ sburger Time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was given in the talks with you for the book &apos; My brother of Pope &apos; ?
did the topic look also in the language ?
Michael Ez@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother , Joseph , Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts X@@ V@@ I. , tells of his perspective , that the cathedral pus@@ hes only played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I was by no means that he led a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent there .
but even this has to be said : without these perfec@@ tionist , without the urge un@@ related discipline , it would probably be possible to form an institution of World tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscu@@ its and b@@ bon alone , one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success , just in which field , but still discipline , passion and overcoming themselves .
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond I saw Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well met and over and over again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , ground@@ ing , profound and sav@@ our@@ able people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something just a fly .
I regularly get along with how many former dom@@ es@@ hips still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ ation , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him to this day was once strictly speaking to them , so are clearly in the minority .
most of the dom@@ es@@ hips are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and has brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , patriarch@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect for the person to look at today and who can literally enti@@ ce them .
and please , once again clearly : all you pres@@ cribes it , educ@@ ation@@ methods that were at the time of the order .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time .
but it is extremely un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ ner buck .
there is the nasty intention that stands behind it , just too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the dec@@ ency would stand , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace .
