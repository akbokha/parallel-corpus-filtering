<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that make your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A tomb which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners help the sticky cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories of days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when landcards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows every one who had to remember, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a walkway.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical Landmark of the Digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are anything but topical - but that is why very concluding.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them to current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the vast picture postcard have been incorporated for cities and municipalities for more detailed cards, so-called Urpositional blades.</seg>
<seg id="13">These arisen according to the Bavarian Vermessengers administration between 1810 and 1864, and then skip the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionation with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops finally went off with the peace of Lunéville, 9 February 1801: we were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Vermeasurable Bureau.</seg>
<seg id="19">The commissioned by Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others to find at the Bayerischer Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison Early / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the card of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built in 21 years after the map of the map, thus 1877, as a Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Sigsendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses undermining are located around 1856 along the present Plinganic road, which was named after 1878 to Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when the first glance: when there is a small-called map with dozens of lines and figures: hand-in writing numbered Flurks from the so-called "Urup," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are no small plots there today no farmers - but small gardeners of the plant 'land in the sun. "</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 swing of the October Revolution, was in fact still a meadow - and not concrete.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the judgement sheet, one reads in the area of today's District Au-Haidhausen is not just the street names" "" "at Gasteig" "" "or from the height of" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once find people with inscriptions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner District-Irrenanstalt" "" "In the Auer Lünen" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of this psychiatrist who is brought up in connection with the death of King Ludwig's reign.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time, and for example, the accusations of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Moreover, he was forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime even this capacity reached no more - the reason for the construction of the cycles in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There, since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex 1920 and walked it into a youth-home with education establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, East residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the Children-Haus "Casa Don Bosco" was set in architectural attention to the country of origin of the Irvine which was destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was located around 1856 as "main square," the merchant named "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies expelled in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages was once at the Marienhof, where these days were the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn platform.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights published travelotion for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promoting coloured has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board of the State of Missouri, who will come into force until 28 August 2017, when travelling through the state and provide extreme caution, as a number of fragmentary occurrenounces-based incidents occur in the whole state and can be noted here," says in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult to win Discriminal proceedings, as well as the prosecutions of the state, disproportionate to minorities, led the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of citizens' rights that happen to men." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin color, they will be assembled or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear discomfort in such an incidence we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The incidents like racist indexes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragmentary circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no longer had a gasoline during the journey and was accused of Missouri in custody without a crime accused.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed out to a recent report by the Office of the Governor-State Building of Missouri, in which black motorists on the State will be 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring it money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, following the latest figures from the hate speech, report to the FBI, which steps the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The commencement of travel is also a response to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to resist a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Society (ACLU) had issued travel openings for Texas and Arizona, following the States of immigration laws passed to comply with local law enforcement authorities, to comply with people because of immigration violations, which in view of ACLU will contribute to further pensions.</seg>
<seg id="66">Tourist openings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weimar project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidejn project is a success project and continues in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Schwendemann family met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into its operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and as many young animals looked after and in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "black hole" is for him the alternative marketer marketer away for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste comes only regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV-president of Fisbach, he signed the Weimar project as" "" "elementary project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not be profitable in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the Motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography" "", "Schwendemann stressed." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteral operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the turnaround project and is happy about the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers must support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the forestation of the areas could be withdrawn for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make their thoughts about how they continue their business," said the mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface is thus 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 euros the half over leader was promoted, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">So we love the farmers 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km Weidejn.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss was clear:" "" "here the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Instructor (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state support of Weidetenunen.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyor of the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "in addition, the invigorous area should not be pliable (Hanglement over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weidezvous project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who would like to build almost 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they start to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetty and liberty ismitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he resorted to their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta described here: "I don't want to go down here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem to which you refer to later has been added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is permissible properly, but as he formulating it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary response to the rising words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your fatigue, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who desire to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the waste waste "on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who decided to place their words after their death at the base - did know very well that they performed a highly-political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting it in an unused classical imaging, the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to return from the right wing to this long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was nobody drawer, but rather an early neo-conservative one who bring the US flame into the recomputed world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.</seg>
<seg id="119">She shall bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great fantasievous act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen from the sublime, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the Decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the prospect of reaching the Miller and Trump ever.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, which is the only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black Plastic members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembered a time when only two bowls were belonged to the Great Britain team.</seg>
<seg id="130">The power-director of the Unchantletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-year member of the World Championship can make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athlets think that something has to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athlets are medals contenders, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m circuit while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the crew for the team chapel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where ever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eiliie brought quite naturally, were great. "</seg>

<seg id="145">Scotland has so far been the best total of athletes at the World Championship seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-winding Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m loops.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare who runs around 1,500 m is another ssoons which one was able to observe the victory at the British team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle was reminded of its first world Championships as the only other Scotsman in the Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannesmen's captain in say that they are "enormously proud" on the fact that many of their countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases the medals and the finals will join in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "to be special about the team captain in it, it is that it was a great honour from the other members of the team, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose it, makes it something very special for me," "" "she added." ""</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the bowls who belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">What do my speech deal as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and take advantage of that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it's just like to be a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: please don't care about a public office if you cannot tolerate the dialing of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers suggested it for all, from the internal policy up to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He slipped in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and wordless we are led to the sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Society complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The stab of the governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the on-line comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hoganese.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept at making Facebook as the primary means to link up with its voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blockade of individuals coming to the Board of Governors - which is a public forum that will be officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse, the acts of the Governors and argued that the Comment of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolling or spammers or water-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, MD., was not filled with water, but she asked for hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "The post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place on the same topic, then they are more rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what are the members of the Governors as" "" "concentrated Spam attack," "" "would others call" "" "intercede language." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance, and to burn demonstrators, and to be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens exactly digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hoganese is not the first public officials to criticize it, that he chimplied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Court James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a voter of her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bein (R) received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washington's time had a similar impact on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondence to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people, the pseudonyme like "Juricola," "Valerius," and "Portius" used, wrote all letters of newspapers, who made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticized its position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and shipping with UK, relooned his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not been silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, opinion of opinion and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery Areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 16.30 p.m. to a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilfiger system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth charity-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The salvation and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tumours to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village of treasure.</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuschapel was first mentioned in the Wurgic Url book: Earl Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the church church of Tumlingen, including the Vogtei" by Magister Eberhard by Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger Berg, was also a glorious court that belonged to the church or the patronage right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the subvillage and the Oberdorf, which today in the village of Tumlingen are still to be recognized, the "mountain" of the third, the glorious settlement of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin this historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronage was made up of the early medieval village.</seg>
<seg id="477">One Lord, who built a church, refunded and occupied with a pastor, continues to be owner of this church, and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Related to this was the right to use a pastor or to propose the bishop a new priest.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The biggest of the two shbarst at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell appeared for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the shutters were caught and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undensely.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 lagged French troops near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearers.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilariuschurch broke off.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the Kirturm was allowed to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year-eight 1834, a storm raged the cherry and half a storm.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent a misfortune, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower alive today remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem took care of the "Schaffissors" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>

<seg id="1127">PSG can make the money easily, so that Neymar signed up and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich glories of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may withdraw a lot of money for the purchase of players, but they must be controlled with legitimate objection, which allow them to break the break at the latitude in their on the football business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken tremendous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheating and riskiked to ruin, when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP declined from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The amendment meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea - has bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and to establish a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year rule period that runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was fallen by the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor to Aleksander Cefera continues to shy away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its treaty.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so that it can be dissolvent for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has made the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a cash sentence of 60 million Euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of which normal 25 players remains limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could attempt to overlist their financial supervision by linking up their income by companies belonging to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a cat-free company could transponder the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not apply as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA's value was applied by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that a part of PSG payments to Neymar over payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Championship in Qatar could come.</seg>
<seg id="1144">However, PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar World Cup will be messed and a kind of maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive, every attempt to consider the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer, speakest on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of EUR 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the final financial year have to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrive a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and Trikotzpurchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League has clearly been irritated, one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars directions by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financing doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a state owned by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Less said on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I searched for something that was similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first tour the 1,000 square kilometres was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a lavish layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add yodelling space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">This was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end she was instructed the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was at 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over one another, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel station is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were messed over one another without having to forge us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order allowed it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine is a classic copper light window of retrouvius across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold tree, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirrors feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we were mirrored units for all seating and glasses of yodelling.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen, if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Composite tables are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garrisome door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan from the stahlreinforced, furnified MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is not so important, so it is when you move the door very easily, very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², one extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basic space - or as your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into the electrical plug in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they are not playing with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest property imperialist Victorias worth over 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have collected 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Therein the family founded Westco Jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail outlets.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bulgans as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Following an agreement with her late father, Colin - of Paul as the "chief operator and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis described - about two thirds of the company's power and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A record states that this means that Colin is owned by 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of €176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affair in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims him out.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argued that this is not true, but throws Paul before, some possessions of incompetent to manage.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hope to confuse the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian legacy writes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides of law.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late-he husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought the milk-bars and delicacy stores from the late 1950-1990s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">You used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin the first Jeansing the family opened.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says that he began Westco, when he was" "" "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi who died in 2012 did not hope her property remunerated to her children.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis-group, with Colin claimed that Mark paid 10 million dollars by leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, so Paul "says" about the conditions of her financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept very back, though he was a former AFL commander-board and after a biography from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media participated in Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I can really not say much" "", "because the case before the courts is." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very sad, very sorry that my brother Paul has chosen to verkusen, and to draw up our family names through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1384">In the middle of 2016, Colin writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our Father had not wanted, that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said, he added that he still hopes for a solution. "</seg>
<seg id="1386">Friday, this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts" Colin wrote Colin.</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumps of new staff is planning to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and they have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new rod of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more equitable course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new rod of the White House, at his first day of working with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wants to repair: poor information given to the President's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Wa's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tamed Trump by monitor their media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back decades - and now where he's in the White House, his television sets is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Candimp was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of jobs that were to convince" "", "said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter is ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we didn't know - that Trumps tweets could have included even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees had made it several times, aggravation of it, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it, that Trump controversy is generated.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may fosters their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of adviser to leading President of strategic reasons for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by porter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks and that he will find out how these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president malignant a printed copy of an article by Gottwateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rocefin Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was exiled from Twitter to Twitter or that he has no concrete evidence offered or that he voiced false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher adds that the president of Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive to influence.</seg>

<seg id="1519">In the West Antarctic, a gigantic ice mountain is solved by the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">He shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut für Polar- und Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers big piston drive now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is with 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the biggest ice giants who have registered researchers over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not work from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent the climate change has played a role in the quarry of the iceberg, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But in total, there have been a series of unusual collapse breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken piston was so far a part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats to the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and goes regularly off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Just north of this cross-feelises was the balance of waxing and abrupting several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelf is there disassembler, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">I'm talking about that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front cannals have never been as far withdrawn as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate on tension and can be crushed, if at a key point a piece can dropout.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase the sea level, because they swim in the water and pushed ice as much water as it gives after fuse itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of shame is causing the glaciers to flow directly into the sea, and much faster can be flowing as before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise the sea level, but only in small dimensions, the British research project is writing the Antarctic of the Antarctic (MIDAS).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is based on AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the four-biggest Schelfeis of Antarctica.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is due to the disappearing conditions and because of the disease transmitted insects, which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to find big headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chains, expert of the agrarian research institutes CRIEPPAM in Provence said: "the Lavender of Provence is effectively endangered because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years, which has brought much less rain in the spring, and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life span of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take up their children with the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or they leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach-bearing.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicid to stand on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no hibernation by the violence, and while throughout the country there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have resigned in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep though its presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his middle-finger with the word "Justice" is hanging at the façade of the Riodoce-building. two porters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahuth.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared subjects, the trauma, their nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was established a Sonet Prosecutor's Office in order to edit the cases of journalists, it initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the committee's protection.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder that are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put on trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist that the violence of Sinaloa must be treated even though they are intra-eastern and although the terrain is still traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the Why we distrust all of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th, Valdez abandoned the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But to the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in the past year and the extradition of the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battleefields of the country, as rival factions are struggling to fill a vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of produced, two-story Mausoles for drug royal who are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of peace, "if only a cartel in control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States has.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling group fractions in the war with Guzmans children.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumptive gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was about to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the smoking dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time the newspaper earned a reputation because of discourage and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it to publish very tough investigations without fear of censorship and readers were intrigued by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one otherwise dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave him that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug store in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task which will be assigned to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do with so many students... why did you not say what went before?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curb the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survived.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his guard.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayanabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they wonder: was his love of routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and remain alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing strips," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "odor is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - as did in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where employees met by Riodoce for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively on governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were protected against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the federal government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who were the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains where the drug gangs have de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week Riodoce has flocked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, focused on the city's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who kidnapped or how it came to pass, so caution was advisable when it was time to write, what every one in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite one of drug hands and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter came from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policeman, which ruled the ruling Institutes Party Party (Pri) which ruled almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri governors were accused due to high-quality cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one, in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman departed a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, the reader would have seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slim body statur.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became the storage space for signs and stickers who protest against the Morde of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapsed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country journalists have become sounding that they organized in organized protests "SOS Press" on walking paths and constructions.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to raise international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, journalists and release them, because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked that she is redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico from organised crime to be" "" "surround" "" "government officials and a simultaneous society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that journalists are not only killed by drug gangs but also by the command of politicians and security guards dealing with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well preserved condition has researchers who describe it as a "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored crop-eaters is the best preserved fossil by its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed from the surrounding rock at the platze, and decided to see more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1932">He discovered Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 Pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peers.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only a little with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it slept," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs copies - the monoa Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this crop-eating, although he is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably by meat freshen diners.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a shielding technology, which is known as a counterpart which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have been allowed to mix better in his surroundings and to avoid his enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines in May for the first time and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markselli after the Museummiopelta Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armours over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the countering is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted enough pressure by meat fresher dinosaurs, that the evolution gained the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that apply the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras and girly animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signalizes that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the crayon time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotten.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his convent Darminated to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Americorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, their latest findings in the journal Current Biology, seem to believe that Borealopelta was versed after death in the sea and was converted to mud.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb flat, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by someone from the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," it was there.</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else had posted the information on their feed, it closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly available on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was here, the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., was killed to tweet live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He poked a picture of brownlebloous body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is so wild," thought Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, crying, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She was watching a live-feed at which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, refuted another policeman of his gun and crying," "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not customary," Ferrell was reminded of her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the type of murder that we have accustomed to us and which we can be typical of." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt the bulk frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and crying. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, the strength and the resistance, that consists of the point of view of the human being, who live in the community and have filled the streets to find answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As a Ferrel with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a matching crown, came to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning, "above the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you do not remember how to fight you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we now go to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not bring them, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of the black experience and of the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves free.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I am lucky enough to give her a experience, in which they personally experienced no eklatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling that I would have a bad service to keep it away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station when she arrived at Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place towards the police authority that became a camp area, when the activists waited for the eventual non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and helped to pass them to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to take up a new kind of activism for ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after the 9th August," she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating fairness and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it is all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said, she and her comrade Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into meaning:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by men - in a community that benefitted from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as follows in an interview recently explained:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and grew up in their voices, and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism by Todestrakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought about the project closer together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" over the years after browsing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, because I will be presented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that it is in the movement "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the strongest contestant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "" "" "consequently, documents of" "" "Whose Streets show?" "" "surprisingly personal aspects of fervor life, as she fell in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and in the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris history repeated the role of black sweowls women in the broader Black-lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement which have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as sulul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in managerial positions have worn the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on various fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay men must bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to remark that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not a affirmativer type of action," "", "at the Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, even though it was at the front line, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the church and the police are continuing.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a proper weekly market, it is all the more important that at least to receive us at least the market hall.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portrait of Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupon and haircut, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst had a 35 year old prison sentence, after she made public messages about the WikiLeaks website publicly.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2nd August is A Bebecoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline was united to their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transgressional and pioneering discrimination, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by the algorithms analysis of DNA which could be extracted and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA-data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurated Determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been talking openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty was sentenced in 2013 because of 20 violations of the SpionageAct, computer deception and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that it was only a single photo - a granular, black-white rfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and a platted blonde with which she has been associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'stranger'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portrayed portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette smoking and chewing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press show of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainted Muse were expropriated to unequal letters, which are interchangeable in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "supporter Images," who foresee a future in which the president of Chelation would convert judgment and she was able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released to demand Manning release after seven brutal years in a military court in Kansas, was a welcome kind of blissful coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">In the opening of the exhibition there is something deep and Starkes, since Donald Trump have a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops, to find new, tweeter ways to inflame the rigid divisions, which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written artistic statement, he called for Manning with her overbig signature, including (the "i" in her family name) having an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandopolies of Cs and GS, and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped that by incorporating the 200 letters (or Nuclotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) show how amazing, at least in biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she comes up with a Freisprechtelefon in his hand from the disciplinarkasbarracks of the United States such as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they put your speech, then they won." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as is anticipated in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacras that relate to hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic Haploggroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, Converters has been employed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company's headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors, which both assisted start-ups.</seg>

<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks people after your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed any disappointments and poignments.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen it very much on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robot is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be crazy here in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotik) (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerialised professor of Robotik and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their climb seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves fun over them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuds have developed from their inflatable partners to robotic partners with a silicon skin, which feels warm to the touch - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adapt its robot according to his beliefs, "and select everything from the eye-colour of the robot to the type of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots" "" "personalities" "" "possess a stepford-woman to be progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen has developed into robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing as, for example, shutter.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the wormspy developed Roxxxy gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," who conveys the impression of shutter and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as good as possible," blackwarmed the site of True Conspy.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So it may seem what you like, and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired in conversation, or she can" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the substituting female properties, the attachments to rape, when one goes one step on Frigid (called here: contradicting) Farrah, very quiet one at most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Vion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their appearance and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, at a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission to an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots and while the FRR realizes their increasing popularity, they still stay temporary at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeating out of the edge-zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange, abusive, until they give permission to the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is some overlapping that these highly developed sex robots exist in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House which is boiled to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterred aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the sleeped body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The objective behind these sex robot is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want it to feel human that they imitate the motion of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement or background history, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disrupt the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Expressed in other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human being</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binder of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US constituency, also families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest feast, there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with horror of Trump if you are horror.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly invited to bursting our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">To have been noticed, the power of Trumps, to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a centre-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone, whom she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for centuries because of politics, suddenly and very peculiar at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a wider context that this brings considerable risks with itself.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the declining effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and Trump we refer to the gruselly possibility that one day could no longer be reptile.</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even startling long-term scenario in which Trump Republican appear" "" "normalized" "" "in the Trump Republican" "", "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of negligence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ancestral version of the madded - the dog on the Autodach who saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - both occur in comparison to Trump in fact one than very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be just mentally to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of the New York Parkdepartment, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinders - all clowns are crisp and the animals are revolve to look at full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music complements this in strange manner.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many Klischees of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, because here two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40 years can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluate the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before using my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to tip the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing down of what actually ought to be an neutral replacement but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with Breache from the prison to the hospital</seg>

<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he had suffered the prison authorities in one case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was condemned to an appeal of prosecutors against a first total attack.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria on her feet.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius said that he held his girlfriend for a nightly intruder that hidden in the cab.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The untreatable condition, affecting in the US around 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes gastrife and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected, meat and dairy products are normally given to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereinkommen that contributes to the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins that contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leitner researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immuncells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, who hide themselves in the body, not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium gets too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was found that a type of tolerance conveying immune cell on mice occurs that carry a particular bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the elements of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that foster tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food they had, the more they had of these immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. repui and one of tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory boil, when the same system also holds on people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immuno cell that realizes the tolerance when it turned out that a group of degree program drivers had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe but that was not accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiologists had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The harms of mice were sequentially and there were six bacterial species found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without it out with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in an sterilous environment so that they did not develop an intestinal microbial and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria effecting the immune system, the researchers were able to grow in a liquid, and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune-cells developed into a tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the fluid has been purified, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolites which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers redoubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan, stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. 's reuteri in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. repteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bodisease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the misbrows abuses pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the scandalous scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisering, spokesman of the Republicans "We are Church," explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be the prestige of the Catholic Church to serve when Müller and Ratzinger would be expressed deep informed about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however criticized that in the reporting of violence can be measured with" "" "two things" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the transgressions in Regensburg has no doubt that it would have to be punished" "" "shameful and shameful acts" "", "but the" "" "state of media manipulation" "", "says the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of call the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of all day experience and is preparing the public opinion that is normal for normal" says Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis mean in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "one likes to go to the church and this is a little freshen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a totally normal pedagogical means" "" "to be done with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse attacks, often also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger translated the reminder "My brother of Pope 'written in 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Ezemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he adds the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment scientist Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, so that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases were used physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially for high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, in contrast to many other defendants, there is a lot of victims, that in many cases, even in many cases, even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezemann explains why the final report was relieved in his opinion by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Ezemann, the 440-page report on the "" "" incidents of violence "" "" by the Regensburger Domspatzen "" "" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift, many students stand up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who has been able to make sure that a domain set was not a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as its Biograph?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Ezemann: if you make the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger actually occurs in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight sites dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspected killings or co-awareness among the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The power of force at the preschool is also unsettling outside his sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can donate it at best to get out of it too late or not take the initial hint seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "domain school" "" "school, on which he worked, was felt by practically all the respondents - literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"" "thus the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes it as a" warm "" "," sincere, "" "," competent, "" "," competent, "" "," competent, "" "," as extremely good-natured teacher who kept the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbbons and "" "" was retrench of the grapes of children. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionist and his high popularity, which also has already led to wake-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he not only threw with chairs and cast the keychain on the ground, but also ear-polish shared and too naughty guys to his hair or ears, he has already given birth to years, deeply regrets and excused for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "to his honor" "" "salvation has to be said, however, that such educationmethods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, widespread, in parents like with teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the separation of violence at the pre-school, admittedly are certainly dreatballs.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself if it was not to do with his acquaintedness and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just stormed him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report raiet Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the report was much talked about by the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also put a load or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse to the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual transgressions claims to have entrusted to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one man's acting deputy for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem in education about sexual abuse has been and is that most victims remain silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they are not familiar with parents and siblings, then they are certainly not part of a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: one more fragmented student formulating it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case, in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had been timely, and would have been able to have the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, accept that any more urgent or more explicit or rather opened, as opposed to their parents, internats, confidence instructors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to a very clear result:" "" "that the students involved in advance could not be confirmed in the examination of the examination and / or their environment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">So, what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of all contributors.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, he cannot be accused of having him not prevented or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it was in some cases happened.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violence" "" "was to read by the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is thrown away in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Ezemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">"" "" "" "but that is precisely the abuse of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is therefore clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report describes incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral leader of the domain.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which Knaben of sadist teachers were pushed and malignited, and among them drained, all went on the pre-school in Etterzhausen und Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already standing on the school-school-school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on the one hand, like most witnesses stress, the topic" "" "Vorschule" "" "tabu." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the domain of the school-school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Ezemann: there has been discipline, but not just sadists of violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims said the general humanity from R., and therefore sometimes even positive memories with it in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most no longer remains the accusation to have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations at a school in which he had not worked and responsible (such a witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does George Ratzinger rigorously follow the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengary for the report that the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">In this he points out that in the preschool continue to practice the test. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "even in view of the danger of negative press representatives, he recommended an urgent entry." ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when the legal clarity existed, when the test of Germany was banned from Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, she occurred in a legal grey area, just as everyone of us knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate how the people affected might have exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say, he always would have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards on the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Ezemann: we can speak historians, from the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism," "", "thus to evaluate the danger of past moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this applies not to sexual abuse, who was abominable at all times and also not for what was broken down in the preschool of adversity and violence at innocent children's rimps, which already goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so earchers and go to the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment is then forbidden, he also strictly kept it in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image of his Regensburger Time, Georg Ratzinger was given in the talks with you for the book 'My brother of Pope'?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic look also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Ezemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother, Joseph, Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, that the cathedral pushes only played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I was by no means that he led a stricter regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this has to be said: without these perfectionist, without the urge unrelated discipline, it would probably be possible to form an institution of World trang, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bbon alone, one does not even make a great singer and stand before every success, just in which field, but still discipline, passion and overcoming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond I saw Georg Ratzinger really well met and over and over again as a wonderful, humorous, grounding, profound and savourable people, from which you can't imagine that he could do something just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get along with how many former domeships still today, 23 years after his Emeriation, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat it as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day was once strictly speaking to them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the domeships are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and has brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, patriarchal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect for the person to look at today and who can literally entice them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you prescribes it, educationmethods that were at the time of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is extremely unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make the medial sinner buck.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the nasty intention that stands behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency would stand, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps in Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
