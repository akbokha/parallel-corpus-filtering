Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always put in drawers or do@@ cked by the outside label that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
at the most beautiful , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , vor@@ m TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
for the whit@@ ening , they spend the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; we must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a breeze &quot; is An@@ ist@@ on as a single mother of two sons to see .

Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ al@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf club in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remember their finish , they put them in the fast Gal@@ lop to the food tr@@ ams .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended then again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament wins - back near horses .
he allowed himself to lead himself with his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , to a horse , he didn &apos;t look for photography .
this was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German Spor@@ thilfe handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
there is no doubt about the li@@ ke@@ able athlete .
Bundes@@ negoti@@ ators , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has had it already .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25,000 Euro as well .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time Master &apos;s winner was recorded on Saturday at the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent belong to the Lei@@ ch@@ ant@@ le@@ th@@ le@@ te Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , who appreci@@ ates Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , who Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , der Spring@@ ve Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard mirac@@ ulously .
many of these sports@@ men were on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part mig@@ rated the illustr@@ ative society into the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ically and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s why both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
however , the two US presidential elections are however at the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp wants to keep a little bit small in doubt as to how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to viol@@ ate the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself would be quite different , claiming to Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will massi@@ vely drive regulations and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax practices - for private people and for businesses .
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has given chances to open chances and needs money .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in fact , Tru@@ mp and Clinton can be almost wor@@ shipped .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so , at Tru@@ mp there are no cross @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power stations and return the coal production in the US again .
oil production should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas , which wants to announce the Paris climate treaty .
with its investment programme , Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ ish Trade Agreement , they both don &apos;t want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both the US do not want to isol@@ ate from international trade - but just protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should then be better paid , calls for around Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must , then he says he will not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp is taking advantage of the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics are holding him before , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every found woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who alone flee , almost already to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen are four women .
each has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in the arm .
he gu@@ essed with great eyes curious in the room .
his mother rests on the table @-@ top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene has a normal function .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a business manager of Con@@ dro@@ us , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen were caught .
they live in the Mün@@ chner north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all@@ ing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ us has made the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner &apos;s Aid .
unfortunately , she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : any woman who arrives here has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are politically per@@ secuted , because they want torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a stage of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ orary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe the end as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells evil .
even here , all women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inf@@ erior and worse if ab@@ used .
this leads to roughly 90 percent of women living in the Mün@@ chner north , trau@@ mati@@ zed they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not formed voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are as usual , that they have nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help , you need more accommodations just for them , calls for danger .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether from a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , some will answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken approximately there are so somewhat in accommodations of the governments .
even in Schw@@ aben , alone , women are not housed alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the Government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some community rentals or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated apart from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that has been published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are stored separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy or being put together men and women can make it - continued - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and readily available for women , is in the study .
as much of the women in need of this protection , it is possible to read the con@@ gestion who gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new work @-@ related measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representative of the Ass@@ istance ties have called their union to approve new labour @-@ measures with their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tor Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for his entire Council since early September .
the J@@ DC said that he had given ministers to respond to the concerns of the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted in July over the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members , which was published on Twitter on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC , Mc@@ court that the government would have kept &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ly quiet , &quot; which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and calls for official new talks about all the concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board approved a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council , for a running program escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning September begin to approve .
the disputes led to the fact that assists in this year were h@@ exag@@ onal , the first total accidents in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istance in Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contract conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that were still prior to the vote of 5@@ 4.000 ass@@ ays and medical students , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for physicians should be established in England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announ@@ cing an official end to the eight months long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gol@@ ese room of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception , I cannot deny myself to the intru@@ der that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles had narrow til@@ ting , and he hardly pointed out heat , even for his back @-@ down relations .
Recep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times .
I could not count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in front of the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day the newspaper described that Erdogan as beha@@ ved as if never had happened a little worse .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite .
but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that President of President of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ren@@ amed .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back .
the decay was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
c@@ anning again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would wear the blame for everything .
most of the most serious accus@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of leading officials that Erdogan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has disputed that v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
after all this meeting took place just because Putin received an excuse by the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he was last month at a failed coup d near his Am@@ tes .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they are counting on a late seasonal rush of the Mediterranean .
this week predicted the state @-@ TV , cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agri@@ business will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulating it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West because its response to attempts was to take power over as a weak response .
to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll will come across the Snow@@ ck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus to give a bonus that he sought after the coup d state support for the elected government bodies .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a profound fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of foreign side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel poorly dealt with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still differences between the two still large differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey supported contradic@@ tory sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both Presidents at the press conference predicted that they had not even stri@@ ped the subject .
the president of Turkey b@@ alled it clearly to answer a question about their differences , whereas Putin decided to emphasize that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO &apos;s member in Turkey was the Russian combat jet , it certainly is better that the two Heads of State had at least talk together again .
Royal Bank of Scotland would no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Board of R@@ BS the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a post office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambitions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since she had almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ing , by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to push more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references are listed , de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange at Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
I say now that we are not pursuing a global goals but local goals .
each of these trademarks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different and our employees are working with the clients .
R@@ BS has already announced that it will no longer lead its six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the bank of the Marche , for how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the leader .
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ assure these brands , so I think that the time has come .

he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ der , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth ho@@ ckey that reaches a milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional , because my family is also here
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it &apos;s happening in New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a bank@@ rupt Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jub@@ il@@ ations when he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a bar@@ gaining career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modernity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have enthusiastic fans for this sport for years .
I said Frank@@ ie in some weeks at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains if he would not only be a weekend and big tournament @-@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has done almost 30 years in Britain , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying finishes to flying discs , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the embodiment of British flat @-@ flat for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to his continu@@ ance .
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue on competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia President Vladimir Putin , Ivan@@ ov , Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his rod of Mr Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the nar@@ ro@@ ast of trust by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin without stating reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dis@@ miss@@ al has been arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was founded in 2012 by Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he finished his degree at the prestigious Staat@@ liche Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive officer and the Office leader of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of head for legislative powers and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broadcast@@ er on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was for a long time one of the nar@@ ro@@ sts of Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he is for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the staff will return to their own wish .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is thus the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently nobody .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president to once lead to Russian environmental policies - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his comments to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in an interview to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .

Queens@@ bor@@ ro@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the northern deck of the que@@ er ferry cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 ch@@ illing rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economics , Keit@@ h Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the land to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ bor@@ af Cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the whole bridge can be found at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , meaning that the whole Deck is ready to be taken up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first test is a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art @-@ oriented high@@ - and deep @-@ construction .
after installing the last track record , and its connection to the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern hemisphere @-@ bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approximately 6,000 tons weighs , and at a slope of about 3 % to be drawn up .
so@@ cle , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team is working , tiny -- on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness or alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three men were &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown off from their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty walking in safety while their boat has moved on from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds , the boat already stood out except its range , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a boat without rescue life@@ jacket .
all of them came aboard the seaside boat trip and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are fortunate to be un@@ har@@ med and alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ motor had a st@@ stop@@ pl@@ eine , however , this sol@@ dering itself however when playing the bot of the bot by the person , who was able to control the boat .
someone has wondered today about these men .
heavy hurt - man stu@@ ds on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and difficult to hurt .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead of alcohol , the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when he came into the flat , he put twice on her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother .
this alar@@ ming with his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother down .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
as the two women represented the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had his sister to the side and reached his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds their own cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Green mine : investors should therefore be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , argument is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation lacks so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD member of the president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in future needs to be 20 percent of all apartments available as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be found in the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to build with investors , who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to be at least 10 percent in such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban residential construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed , should ensure incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U should make investors as few provisions as possible .
the left wants to defend har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of its fr@@ ying , a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the residential construction market .
the action concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the expertise .
but the program is not entirely entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be constructed in any case .
how does one like the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments , whose support will run over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
to prevent this , so the planned police spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be able to buy @-@ in links from the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to competition .
this is possible in the Western city .
to one fell sw@@ oop the problem can be solved .
because in the Western city there are a year @-@ end deadlines .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to prices for cheap apartments .
only : it does not want the owners , the apartment companies .
because the number of social housing in the Western city is again dras@@ tically increased , one gets away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; spokes@@ man Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must take into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concentrated on more grounds for family @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that worth it
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that teenagers and child are no longer going out to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many be@@ ys .
with Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people out of the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then to video games and most recently on smartphones .
it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer of course to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was created on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later developed a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k up the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that over@@ took the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon go more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphone and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( over a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that re@@ plac@@ ements the &quot; average &quot; person each day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users re@@ pro@@ secuted , the Washington Post recently dealt with that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of followed people , which j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent every day .
the company does not know who Pok@@ é@@ mon Go does not play - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and come true by people who look at the el@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued .
who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
therefore , three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even join the hunt for even new friends .
as always there are also Moravian game cor@@ rupted who must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it do ?
it has taken a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity before , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction and use it with time .
because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help so many people on the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ it creates gold in the D@@ ress
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ator .
the 19 @-@ year American gymn@@ ast cat@@ er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their total result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal and &apos; Final Five &quot; Mann@@ es@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ closure of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American &apos;s Simone Bil@@ es played on the pig @-@ bal@@ ken during the solo @-@ struggle for women in the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ s is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American woman who won a multi @-@ battle title and the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was to an end .
this success exhibits them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ it has dominated the last three years her sports style , 15 world cup - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ans of 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton of her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of excessive expectations .
not having a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas return , would be considered as disappointment .
the American &apos;s Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace you after they have won gold and silver in the single @-@ battle of women in the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was at the farewell party of the team who was reti@@ ring , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi used as a proxy .
although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long departure to the top , never the future planned , this is not really true .
part of its ground exercises - which included their typical Tum@@ bling passport - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl adopted by her grandparents as a small child and approved by trainers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school cur@@ bing into the gymn@@ asium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
it has not lost a multi @-@ contest competition since the summer of 2013 , a triumph@@ al series that will continue for as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two la@@ vers , decei@@ ved the image .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ s holds the world championship - lau@@ ded .
they brought back again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 and sat down with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently as she was expecting her en@@ roll - a pure form@@ ality - and tears s@@ war@@ med over it shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their collection , became a reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina went .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year team team had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gran@@ ny &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her soil exercise , she threw out to the audience Kus@@ sh@@ i , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback that was sometimes doubt@@ ful .
as for it , the rapid twe@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the start of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ings while music are shot in the car
according to police reporting that were published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl have been killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of death of Phoenix , while they were talking in the car and listened to music .
Angela Merkel Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was parked in a drive , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is to read in the report .
the police shared with the fact that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder had not been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ everything , as the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t have the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting g@@ rie@@ ve the investig@@ ators to become a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
altogether , predominantly in H@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed within four months in nine months , seven people were killed and two others have been wounded .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard results of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW made from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to conclusion that attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their wounds and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ted car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was referred to an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and came out from the date that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat and ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the motor .
mother of a 6 @-@ year old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course its mother .
but as the few@@ est of its aging has Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy did not know anything .
when he first came home , my first thought , I managed not .
I do not create that .
I did not let myself let alone .
what is not true at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund may never be recognized by circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they swal@@ low him to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I did not know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund may be run by means of a wal@@ ker .
Edmund could not sit id@@ le until his third year &apos;s third year and he can still not speak .
but it is making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers and singing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign of prayer for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing with &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the ci@@ ca@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminiscent of the emotional price of an un@@ familiar future .
I asked ever what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I have not been asked for a long time since pre@@ diction , because I don &apos;t expect that someone really can tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce rainf@@ alls , floods gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
intense rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to rest on Friday the staff . it will be reck@@ oned for all Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous rivers in the southeast Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods to extreme rainf@@ all , reported to the national weather service .
governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared with the government officials in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been on the way to the municipalities that are concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood @-@ war@@ time system is used by wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed , that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall to rain .
in the south of Alabama a fl@@ atten@@ dant system was used on Friday while it ra@@ ined in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite close to Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , who are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will reach all probability beyond the weekend record level .
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers might be flooded into many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stro@@ ward flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , since these over the beaten rivers will be slow to flow in Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi state in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 9@@ am .
rescue team still sli@@ pped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet away from his house , over night very rise .
he said it is another step @-@ man who lives nearby , warned .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flo@@ cked and flo@@ cked , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it achieved my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Han@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he was the only one who can swim .
Han@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fers saved all three in a big military @-@ truck and brought them to the next fire @-@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities take into consideration regulatory instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer sent near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inch of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been substantially extended since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding were caused by the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five schools .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary EM@@ L reported that a subsi@@ ding in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 completely und@@ ated houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which now were both flooded .
the rulers of the village Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets saved from high water .
in the cities Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond were decorated to accomo@@ date evacu@@ ations to evacu@@ ate the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water start to fall back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were made due to the flood and provided sand@@ bags for the residents who are hoping to keep the water out of their homes and stores .
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississippi , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined at the Gulf Coast .
according to his data a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as sw@@ amped , but on Friday they were not reported .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I simply cannot believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy divided the sender with that he is expected to recover again .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic presence and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been in the Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic in is , complete , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female tur@@ ner@@ ers was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas seen a surprising Olympics in America and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they expected unexpected , yet master@@ ly G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ battle event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so the classes in the whole country do not look out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all went the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; final Five &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ner@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that turbul@@ ence is a dear@@ er sport and turbines are maintained primarily in private turn@@ around which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furniture , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner get her entire training and this is a te@@ ens and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , instructor of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started practicing .
we have to give the churches au@@ n innumerable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , make a performance and easier access turn@@ out .
I was founded my gym of 20 years .
during my events , we have provided free and affordable tur@@ ings in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide youth high @-@ quality turbines , which earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ key develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care about Tur@@ ning and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance practitioners want to organize more strikes after they have rejected the Jeremy Hun@@ t proposal .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reform@@ ist treaty with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Ass@@ istance who voted for a choice to reject him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans un@@ veiled to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS were ordered in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody &apos;s land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay had been harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first Ass@@ istance will receive a new contract , which includes changes to bed@@ - and weekly work to improve the care of maintenance hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ es shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ass@@ istance in the proposed agreement remains serious concerns , in particular that it will cure the current staff crisis and to treat all doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in just eight weeks , still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts from the BM@@ A to solve the disputes by talks sti@@ ff@@ ing in the government for the sake of reluct@@ ance and sometimes on ear @-@ making silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened that the Jeremy Hun@@ t did not last until the last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeremy Hun@@ t has to act now , up@@ lift the condition and address the worries of the assistance personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , then they have made the assistance of the Ass@@ istance that they are ready to conduct further work measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 days before , since nur@@ ses and experts were included to give doctors on the strike @-@ chain coverage .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reform@@ ist agreement with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A would like to make a better wake @-@ up for the 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istance who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour @-@ measures achieve nothing of only little but stra@@ ined teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing care and their families only worry , poverty and interruption . &quot;
over the past two months we have talked to the general health of assistance , and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to respond positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ gging .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

the Reg@@ ulators of N@@ HS has recommended a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of this suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty materials in the arteries , the bel@@ s form .
when the covering breaks , it may cause a blood c@@ ots , that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ ots occurs , it may flow through blood flow and con@@ stit@@ uting the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk , by making the formation of blood cl@@ ot@@ ters un@@ probable .

the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attack and stroke with people who already had a heart attack .
through a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to extend the available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it .

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess makes electoral strategy in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was arrested last year on request of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess has led to know@@ ingly ignored that the widespread election was ignored in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , electoral observing and Rath@@ vern@@ s for making evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities of eth@@ ni@@ al and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and community government , which is now a face @-@ corruption , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off gaps outside of electoral control in order to protect their vot@@ er voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID to prove to prove their identity in elections .
at present a vot@@ er must merely call its name and address .
the report proposes not to accum@@ ulate even the finger of a person if they give up their vote to prevent someone twice chosen .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal committee and decisions of un@@ official documents or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves electoral fraud , but it is also intended to protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged from Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the official Mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man should be transferred to cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ secuted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that he had sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ is@@ ers and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or a result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses other than anyone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , he was particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence with the older members of the Muslim community , have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the watches of wise to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ arian or ban@@ ging background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state institutions such a behaviour should be ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ al and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activ@@ ist to edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral code on immigration and social bet@@ ter@@ ment purposes .
take into account voters before choosing to ask your ID .
do not even use any ink on the finger of a person once she has released her voice to prevent someone twice chosen .
systematic transmis@@ sions about the nationality of a person carry out to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic brief@@ ing .
prohibition that political activists need complete brief@@ ing and re @-@ vers of let@@ tering elections .
the police give the authority to set up bul@@ g@@ ments for electoral purposes .
a legislative amendment , which defines an accus@@ ation for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representative Law 1983 ) .
photography has been offered in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees usually enforce that voters are going on their own in the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets won &apos;t show a fin@@ alization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on to Rah@@ man and his deputy for the corrupt and illegal practice as un@@ suitable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ ger &quot; of the constitu@@ ent departments of the Town H@@ alls too .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court section in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
our country bears as the mother of the parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and distor@@ ted spread of electoral fraud and denial of some government thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double @-@ lin@@ ers and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are marked this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that has proven to be impressive double @-@ predecessors in the Her@@ zo@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ac@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold fighters who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one can give faith to social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ers at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympics to show more than just a certain similarity with wood @-@ most famous .
the hunter and the Wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates doubles in the radar , many people in the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini @-@ Pro@@ mi &apos;s Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star scary .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to him that he has already been hearing from his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see a big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I hate this probably as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly appear again in the center : the opening similarity between the British for@@ et@@ inger Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her large , expres@@ sive eyes shall act as a double @-@ year for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gets higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a further sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which shows similar eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun@@ bath@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong Women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that others also like the similarities .
theory put into space : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in explained her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular comparisons embr@@ aced Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their S@@ mile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , a big smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made that it will be broadcast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we quickly used our audience on the show and our followers in the social media .
in order to clarify one , B@@ yron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy formulation . B@@ yron does that which he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to apologize for the comment I had made after the women &apos;s swimming staff@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and did not refer to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged over woman who ling@@ erie in the middle of the shop under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see where a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try to try shelter .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , they insp@@ ected how they looked at it , she moved out and laid them back into the shelf .
they went on and try four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before putting her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the business without buying something . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the stand @-@ space , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the base , pulled out their own whirlpool and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ing when she re @-@ pulled back the under@@ pants since she obviously didn &apos;t like her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that her fell to her , and went out again .
&quot; it did not bother to dis@@ rupt that someone was watching someone rather than thinking about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that she tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to think that somebody would take shelter at home who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried the clothes from the sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out again and did not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com might make him more secure for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ ana in New York to find out how to handle armed predat@@ ors on the near distance .
regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate the sp@@ ar for your rob@@ bers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you move from the back then you should turn out to be a quick@@ est , so you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the wal@@ nut , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him then with the knee into the bar , and rot@@ ate while the att@@ acker war@@ ms against pain , the gun from his hands . beat him with the run to the face and move backwards while she turns the gun towards it .
with att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot , grab the gun and twist them , so that the Att@@ acker can not shoot .
kill the weight on the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rot@@ ate the gun from its grip before they move backwards and the gun towards it .
sounds difficult ?

travel Ian W@@ right dra@@ in for one guide his tongue at the dirty locations of Europe
a British travel sup@@ pressed his immune system and lit@@ ters of a serious test - by considering some of the most dirty and most beneficial places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel @-@ author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k f@@ aded his course on a euro che@@ que , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button in a tractor and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system .
before deri@@ ve any object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some start@@ ling results to day@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ cks of a tractor bur@@ dock , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually they are in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right talked to physicians and medical experts on the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria , as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he was depar@@ ting , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been well @-@ known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling around the world and would like wonderful things .
from public transportation to train stations to dish@@ wash@@ ers of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task turned its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively in@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was justified his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public res@@ tro@@ om in Russia .
his prob@@ ation painted showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters of over 4000 units .
compared to this is the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters of fresh hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om , which he refused to dis@@ su@@ ck after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eters over 4000 units was , while freshly harv@@ ested hands have been one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ er m &apos; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different locations like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I have rolled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ ate than that !
I will find nothing here because it is indo@@ or@@ ical here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company stat@@ s Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and the immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something which is fascinating to watch , and at the same time explains the benefits of probio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended up so that we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian calls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context , the good and poor bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala which led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he liked some of the things that I told him , such as the ek@@ eli@@ ble Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things where it was easier to get Ian to do them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies to film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of vali@@ dated survey conducted in 2015 Associ@@ ated 84 percent of all respondents rep@@ lic@@ en@@ li@@ ds in particular with the well being of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products using the included milk @-@ acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication Social @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ oc@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because their neighbours had terrorist .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they were rap@@ ed from their estate , the con@@ domini@@ um co @-@ administr@@ ated shareholders have found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls exp@@ elled holes , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered over the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family have been cleared and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for household management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I believe that people do not have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is as well .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , street struggles with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ay , shy of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , quar@@ es and flu@@ kes .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
there were been in the estate that were tra@@ ded in the past drugs called wood@@ ri@@ mp@@ s
neighbours were saying they had to fight them on the streets and they regularly had to be called police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ fted them and their partner this week by keeping them from the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to deliver voluntarily .
the del@@ oc@@ ation were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who told their lives to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sli@@ pped around no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the cultivated site of the Joint House were rub@@ b@@ ish garbage and old toys .
he added : &quot; it &apos;s a shame that there is a shame to take any responsibility for their behavior and that of their families , because Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case , as the behavior was extremely difficult and had to look aw@@ fully with their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have ple@@ dged to us and have given us the information provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will con@@ sol@@ ation some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all are over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house following the del@@ oc@@ ation .
workers of the household management will now have to miss garbage dump , surrounded by the house
in 2014 the police took a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ ri@@ age and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine @-@ penalty after they had found guilty of the own@@ ing of a class B in merchant supervision .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 at a car accident .
after having been without Ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ ings of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will seek r@@ enter , who will not stick to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ oc@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants which do not stick to the order order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ action as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

this was the moment , in the scar@@ ed tourist starting to panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ ant jet falls down over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft almost in close proximity to the sun@@ spots on the beach @-@ section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal flew .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers looked at , when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the mu@@ zzle , without first seeing what caused by the clouds to them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers that post videos about dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deeply and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno arrogan@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved in panic , when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats off the coast and so fly deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that the Jet due to bad visibility had flew a little deeper than usual in the proximity , however , pers@@ isted the air forces that certainly at no time was je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed .

the Catal@@ ans come in the du@@ el to the Spanish super@@ cup against FC Sevilla , the set@@ play increases three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the dou@@ ble@@ ak must refrain from har@@ ness with the sub@@ du@@ ly C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe @-@ league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who takes the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil .
furthermore , Go@@ aly Marc @-@ Andre is also missing .
the German suffered a changing du@@ st@@ ening in the knee , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca has at least been clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen in Barcelona have been around the status for two years now .
Coach Luis En@@ rique was rel@@ o@@ unded to a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but for sure T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of the other candidates appear .
before the first mandatory game of the new game , there are doubts about the fitness status of the team during the Spanish Master , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the course stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co . did not really convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seville again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and asp@@ ires to the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the end@@ game and made the title among each other .
thus , it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title under the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were on the plate alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches themselves .
they withdrawn from the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ector at a fair competition alone .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I was playing for me , &quot; said Z@@ hang .
after the Parti@@ e posed Gold@@ - and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China @-@ Flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace at the plate and let the opposite go there only a total of 13 points .
through the superiority of Ma was not the expected match .
yet , nevertheless , sufficiently stunning ball @-@ changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze at the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans had stepped in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Championships Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , was afterwards out of doctor &apos;s treatment , had to be lab@@ elled out .

Donald Tru@@ mp adm@@ t ″ huge problems ″ to the campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in the traditionally conservative states of the state .
presidential ambassador Donald Tru@@ mp has now made some weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ proof Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ bear as something as concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts grow in his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ icals as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame may be false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he restored his well @-@ known media sh@@ ook .
republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ les
Utah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ US in June , Tru@@ mp and his conversation from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , was equal .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance which are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the Sender CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to what he wants to stop at Clin@@ ically &apos;s march : &quot; as I have made it so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he will be back : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end of political correctness , whether in order , Tru@@ mp told us .
then I will return to a very good way of life .
according to press reporting , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened , funds to support his election campaign , should he be able to present no better surveys .
instead of this , the candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans for Congress is stronger than the poor .
Olympia : tri@@ ister fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arity in the case .
Kenya Un@@ ch@@ ant@@ le@@ tes threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a bed @-@ test attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to the home .
the International Olympic Committee met with , as soon as a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ Commission to investigate the fall .
a ken@@ i@@ anic function@@ ary had told that the previous spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , released a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner at Ro@@ ti@@ ch in the Olympic village .
this was reported by the Team Ken@@ ias of the dop@@ ing controllers .
the World verband IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case to make own investigations , divided a IA@@ AF spokes@@ person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures in the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF becomes a rating , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the test made and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Kenya &apos;s mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls in the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 metres in Beijing World Cup in 2015 .
four days before was the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ op@@ tic Deleg@@ ation President Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted by the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed about money @-@ payments of his country about pending d@@ oping tests .
according to his return at the airport , he is to report on his return at the Nairobi airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long period of time , Kenya is already under a special observation with the IO@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the IO@@ C announcement made more than 2000 D@@ oping target checks in front of the Rio Olympics , it was unfortunately noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into sight .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before Olympic Games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight coinci@@ des with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the gul@@ f of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , the ARD have always risen again that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports dec@@ eption .
i@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had put them in the Russian body @-@ le@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ type and systematically exp@@ ired .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were subsequently excluded from the summer &apos;s games .
Salzburg &apos;s West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival explores the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ is@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a youth .
in the orchestra dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say that they are very l@@ ent in Latin American . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have music in our blood !
at this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older one .
she is reminded of melanchol@@ y due to their love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then Mary would be a personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character , which I saw as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singers : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an extremely generous human .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compliments back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is for him a necessity .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American film@@ maker Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we left the refugees who went to New York at that time , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died after her family shortly after she had been able to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war area - to prevent people from getting this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 SU@@ L@@ TA@@ NA and two other school@@ ma@@ ids came from East London to a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as family has been told that she has married a ISIS of ISIS in Syria - and was the widow within a few months .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes its own refugees , produced in their own country of refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association chief said the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in order to raise the entry to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or marketed in the past hundred years , &quot; says Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president demanded that the federal government faces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdogan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics .
in the last months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of freight movement fears also the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ ler@@ y as a Gü@@ len @-@ adher@@ ents , teachers and other academ@@ ics are the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on packed caffeine , incidentally also the ca@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported under calling on figures of the Federal Bureau of German , the Turks created the biggest group of asylum @-@ asylum seekers in Germany before the coup d .
on June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and therefore nearly 29 per cent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no war against war , poverty , or perspective .
asylum entitled according to the Basic Law are solely politically , so by governmental side , individually per@@ secuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia may not choose the country tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
once the country @-@ election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament &apos;s parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because as far as so far it is not about : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ bal@@ dness - this bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced of the fighters are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you are not allowed to choose the country tag .
in addition , practical problems : during the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang on the posters , fl@@ us@@ ons , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and end up voices , are only fatigue away .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to come over by the people even in the election campaign .
the hot water when you can tell it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U Coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how heavily newcom@@ er African D cuts and what remains the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ less .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Minister of Govern@@ ors , making an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous campaign , one sees from his large pl@@ aten .
he travels through earth , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it was already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ ger &apos;s predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise past@@ ing has got sea @-@ old feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will now cost him very nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time on the right place .
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ written reference ; Merkel Bundest@@ ag@@ gra@@ ded circuit is in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently at the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a pity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once again .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely disp@@ ens@@ ed on the usual franchise markets on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so co @-@ ordin@@ ates , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has marked that you sc@@ anning the base on the land that it must be very strict once again to find a wire to the people .
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the minds of the country hardly there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U franchise is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats finally stood with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , petty @-@ party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should create the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make out of the holidays need a modern virtue , and reloc@@ ate their election campaign to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online electoral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the Governor Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green electoral fighters are looking for local stimul@@ i among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top edge @-@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg @-@ Bur@@ gic lakes and finds it even nice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest sites suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B is soft , there is nothing to complain about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the work of construction , which at 5.@@ 30 am start and only at 8 p.m. , there is much praise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have done everything quite z@@ ag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no reference .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south on the weekend to the half @-@ time planned , by the end of October everything should be done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will also be praised for the work responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up residence trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to the south and also the block from the Asp@@ erg@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation inside the village has relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rest of the transport through the place seems to come back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director responsible for the marketing @-@ related management of the rehabilitation director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar Street , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many ne@@ ars were seeking and rather to trust their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to many truck in residential areas would be fran@@ ked .
as the speed limiting limits have not been observed , the community called for rein@@ forces the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable consideration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute stran@@ ded .
the fastest one was with 77 hours per hour in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , but it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 there is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men are not happy to look into the cards .
however , that the B @-@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to sales revenue among them , lets each one wonders , look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z talks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also that of course , &quot; the tre@@ ad@@ ation is missing . &quot;
the most strongly exploited are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the hosts have made it &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue rose to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking took its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have responded differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it answers a financial compensation , otherwise apart from the advantages of the location at the B 27th Now they also need to carry the disadvantages , which result through the reconstruction .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other administrative districts , where such a little gr@@ aci@@ ously dealt with .
with all the pl@@ agues , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family run already since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now often subject to serious traffic conditions because of complex traffic conditions , it can be understood .
if one cannot drive , it is also somewhere beautiful .
the fact that its regular cli@@ p@@ est returns to the end of the restoration work again , G@@ öh@@ ner did not doubt .
despite the crises of BS@@ E and bird gri@@ ps , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its cli@@ ent@@ ele for the largest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly shar@@ pen@@ ed in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick safety package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ant status have to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are aimed at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are asking for anyone else .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
even in this respect I do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Interior Minister he was situated on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , there has been a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , before it presents his conclusions for the security of the republic .
but they are all even more extensive .
some is known , announced , announced , that a new safety authority for the Kn@@ ack is to take care of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on air ship data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising .
partly , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère ki@@ cks up a second attempt on proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants to pose sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terrorist groups and jihadists in the German passport with double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he still consider this to be reasonable and therefore also nothing , what I do not have any chance at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
some of them are in themselves : he plans to push @-@ de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are deliberately fet@@ ched in the country are expected to check @-@ in their smart phones and disclose social media account for a security examination .
if for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to ask some worse than before - about such crimes , the crimes or their papers are aware of their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
some also still appears un@@ folded and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the unequal treatment of thought , for example - raises the question : what does this actually do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be stated in paragrap@@ hs , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also many people in view of the high refugee numbers concerned about security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that the people are deeply affected , let themselves not cling in election times even in election times .
the inner security is enormous into the focus .
first of the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral fights .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly moving towards inner security .
in the last days between the two parties were high .
only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior Minister , where the offices were also a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a return from the double pass it will be nothing .
we have the discussion in Germany .
to be up @-@ to @-@ date , be not useful .
and with a guy ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er , has yet to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , what could be done to dispute .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ secu@@ te the issue of internal security .
party &apos;s chef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled only very careful conversations and say , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses through .
despite diesel engine , the delivery line increase worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the recall campaign is a term for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recall &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the supplies , in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest highway can be present in the course of the past year despite the diesel @-@ aff@@ aires , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ ongoing markets .
but in July he weak@@ ened the nucleus of VW , especially in Western Europe , and then lo@@ oted again to the total sales , as the company listed in D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand sold over the world in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the same year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , the sales were 14 per cent below the same year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the supplies to almost one @-@ sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann President Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote also stressed the British vote for leaving the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor were escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to book .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the decl@@ ining trademark of the Lower Saxony already declined percep@@ tible by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is only a cost @-@ minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to book .
Group President Fred Kap@@ pl@@ ers could continue to advance a sales spl@@ itting from January to July .
1,3 per cent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software assignment .
in Germany alone , some 2.5 million vehicles calls for re@@ armament to the workshops .
in the course of the re@@ armament , VW , that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects .
after the re@@ armament of vehicles there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power no degradation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car@@ makers present the customer after the conversion of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was on Friday in a company tour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for legal le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reports , Volkswagen granted his German customer now a guarantee of reloc@@ ated diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
out of the Traffic Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the requirements of my investigation Commission and the KBA full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; variations are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power after the conversion , no deterior@@ ations take place and all type @-@ approved cars remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen allows the possibility that customers get used for example a half year after conversion , e.g. with a motorcycle , which could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhau@@ st sc@@ andal , to ensure a re@@ assurance regarding the possible warranty regulations , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank &apos;s manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , the 40 million euros in Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily cash @-@ accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see the signal ; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not have to fear for their austerity incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bearings banks make money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent criminal offen@@ ders .
this charge asks the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euros on g@@ ro@@ - or post @-@ cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 is to cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had 40 million euros for quite some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the others and which he could not evaluate .
&quot; they are with me in the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the banker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for each million 4000 Euros &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will now give the expenses for the principle of the objection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply stuck in the Tres@@ ae of Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve experienced four crosses , I still don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and their approach to other forms of investment .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing a considerable cost in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are alone to wear , be &quot; operating @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million Euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their skat@@ bank branches in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect that private clients have to pay low @-@ wide compensation for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el , which is equipped with a little abundant property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank when it is free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bel@@ os@@ ci@@ ence bank G@@ mund is based in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ ers , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region , renowned actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the genocide of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently no further banks are known , who comp@@ ute a withdrawal for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives on the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ eth the emig@@ ration from An@@ leg@@ ern to the competition .
the customers in Germany won &apos;t please the width .
destination panels : who actually buy records ?
lonely men love middle age love plates .
before you hurry to the commentary , to so@@ w him under the alias non @-@ sam@@ le@@ ction of men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v the diverse revival of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that would like to greet the news of physical objects but to a mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who have recently purchased a record are of any for@@ esi@@ ght according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer .
there is also no horror by Hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional importance : older record purchaser retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , would follow me to follow the camera while I walk in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a humble servant and wild@@ ly , before I stand for rest , my hands and some sort of determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart So@@ hos gets slowly down to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ around .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) to the Rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , question I ?
&quot; I already reck@@ on , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed ) to dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy records which he could not afford to buy records when they appeared and re @-@ buy items that he sold , when he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who are buying the boards , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works by S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers , which he meets to apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and led to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have managed , people usually have been bot@@ tled up to 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the records of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took impetus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of confidential sound @-@ sl@@ itter , of objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ cl@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ gs a staff of a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not heard yet .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a turn@@ table , whom they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of news report , I would probably look very worried , while I blows through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put it into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ las@@ er@@ less , less musi@@ kl@@ ash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who are only slowly coming .
stop that has devoted the sound plates to almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts new syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz , from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such a diversity among the customers .
none of them looks quite lonely , but wet mental trau@@ mas are difficult , if one stands for next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for several minutes and looks at the vari@@ et@@ s@@ own of the records .
it is more of a man@@ nequ@@ in than a large screen saver .
she does not deserve much , so the collecting of boards is not a real option , she says .
it will cost a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers is to be inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression the je@@ ans hot@@ spots , I observe a group of young teenagers , group@@ ed up for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above , that it is impossible to touch her .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one who has many lux@@ uries like plates .
even though my research results revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record business in Soho , the great number of female collector who exist in reality , record stores and in online research , un@@ considered .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not by stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and leaves by plates , while they ste@@ er the rigid look of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , who prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders nothing of the middle aged men .

French Court borrowed an offer over demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French Court has rejected a range of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
in case of court hearing this week , the authorities argue that the state ought to be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops , sell cigarettes or En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or to sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and which a fire@@ - and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups cannot provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run 72 provisional shops , but that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café des camp , which is shared mostly and 200 meals a day , English , and French classes , as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;s Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , the recent eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos; Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants stated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle who has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympia disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant

&quot; I keep the world championship in view , remain confident and fights , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it is hard to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s sha@@ fts have to adjust to the next generation of speed sensor : in different states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should over@@ run Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der especially effectively .
the futur@@ istic contributors of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , can be used for example on accident prevention , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction or to block bridges with temporary Tem@@ plate , there is often no necessary infrastructure to make the speed limit there with a stationary blood package .
a lasting mobile building can however be too dangerous or time @-@ consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days running at irregular measurement , the dropping data is encrypted via a modem .
laser technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed bumps as well as a transit message after time , riding strip and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ driving condition you can move the pend@@ ant according to the manufacturer by car with trailer cl@@ utch .
so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is lowered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear .
in addition , a built alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer for the information of Vit@@ ronic is tested in various federal states and has now also been used .

great Britain wins silver at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji &apos;s master class gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived at the finals on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when faced with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the defensive stage here in Rio .
Fiji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , pressing , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ in line of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ eten by the not too bad weather price of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they swal@@ low New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fiji on this form would have been a 15 @-@ man team in its form .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago it was lost under Ryan of every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is going to do , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started and caused the attacks to GB@@ s from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to above , than O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with even four minutes of game , Jerry Tu@@ wai still got another attack from the right @-@ hand corner that he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly hole the ball .
a hot bapti@@ sm@@ al T@@ ackle of Mitch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has just stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s so as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still un@@ learned .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half times by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for quite four minutes , what was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant balance of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of southern overseas , whose fans s@@ als , flags and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced themselves and GB ki@@ cking crus@@ hing into the law@@ ns .
earlier in the day , Fiji had been defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton dis@@ rupted the line with impressive foot@@ work and recorded a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant condemnation of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ hour team , won the prize - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than with those games and that wants to be called .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard hits , which enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they subsequently bre@@ ached the second Olympi@@ ad in two without a tax in succession , for the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ ter imp@@ aired use , which is also unparalleled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected in the type of triumph@@ ant .
behind each gold in ruin , a batt@@ ali@@ on are contributing to wil@@ ful hel@@ pers which make up the difference and it was no man assistant than the coach , which was not known 30 months ago , whether he would survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was risky .
I had b@@ mp @-@ cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a fairly bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which had kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
the rowing itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the im@@ min@@ ence of victory , their first thought of Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ up morning in order to talk a little more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was the captain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was a emotional wre@@ ck this week . this may be something extremely , but it doesn &apos;t mean so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repeated how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I could not have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams came from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had access to reserve .
we were very in the moment captured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not get involved .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing some Tol@@ les .
today , we did not want fire@@ works , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventur@@ er Steve back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years exemplary on clarity for clarity
the managing director of the water@@ pur@@ ge group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fres@@ co@@ lic drinking water @-@ purpose integrated as a model for the large water producers .
it was for some time ago in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
slightly later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was crow@@ ned the second @-@ association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; Bav@@ arian is far from being exemplary . &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the purpose @-@ association , 28 years as CEO .
now at the age of 65 he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of lati@@ brunn , is about 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 locations and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member communities are the churches of parish , lati@@ tude , loud , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further towns and municipalities , there are water supply agreements .
the current chair , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Citiz@@ enship in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was appointed as Aqu@@ arius , and was appointed as Managing Director of the Pur@@ ch@@ association already in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they sought out from water management and maintenance activities , bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calcul@@ ating fees and entries to emergency approaches at weekends , &quot; said the Chair@@ woman .
as outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ establishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the divi@@ ding of water pipes .
there have been no stal@@ em@@ ate and one has always added any new features , because water lives and drinking water is the most important food .
in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised i@@ est , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ation group to the nit@@ rate &apos; water forum in front of the District &apos;s Unter@@ fran@@ ken District .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller joined the one hand , Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ front and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he drew the fountain building and the restructuring of the two @-@ house association .
but the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est use were but the spring break at the he@@ ater in Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once only because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with loops .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was transferred to Daniel storms from lou@@ der , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes open with the au@@ ti@@ stic of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to have the courage to speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corri@@ ere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease has been recognized for her son , they believed that it must die .
the meanwhile eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well forward and learn now privately in New York , where the best therapists give .
&quot; in order to give an example : if I ask him something that lies two years ago , when I sang at Mail@@ änder Scala , he recalls nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot on Friday against 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) in his partner and killed them fatal .
&quot; the man has called for himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ man .
the off@@ ender is on the run , after him I will be publicly punished .
meanwhile , nationwide , because Sven S. could be with the car on the road .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ch .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with them , so the police .
who Sven S. sees , will call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim is year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
in Lü@@ beck , the local police in Lü@@ beck , first of all , did not want to make information about the Ta@@ ther@@ ners or the relationship between the perpetrators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command ( SE@@ K ) was in the scene .
steel - lighting for German steel industry
the cro@@ pping @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in million@@ aire .
financial stresses that thre@@ aten the sector from the oil production line , are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the liberation from the renewable energy situation in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad we were able to finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned , the steel producer , the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ v to generate electricity for their own consumption to ask for the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry offers additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it will now give a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , all of them have an E@@ EG &apos;s turnover of 20 percent .
but also these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on its own production .
thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; further must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when reform of the E@@ mission For@@ eh@@ and@@ els are considering climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from its financial crisis since the financial crisis of 2008 and a substantial price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the situation also exac@@ erb@@ ated itself more than the world &apos;s largest producer of domestic demand for steel to the world market .
European manufacturers shed Chinese steel @-@ resistant price @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties on import steel effect , to the other have built the economic prospects in China .
unclear how sustainable the price @-@ up is re@@ conditioning .
the German industry pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained war@@ y on Thursday .
most recently the prices would have been more st@@ agn@@ ant .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with additional cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted not to exclude lock@@ ings of individual works .
in the German steel industry there were approximately 8@@ 6,000 people at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturers will stay carefully in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons of well as six percent less crude steel as in the year &apos;s year , such as the economic association of steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the set quantity now went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is worth two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association is counting in the coming months due to improved order situation with an increasing capacity .
community , spirit , health : singing is so good
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , studying music , she triumph@@ ed the com@@ partment , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; sing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; describes them .
after a sample they feel balanced , mer@@ ry and a total of living , she says .
she is doing something good at the same time with her health and mind .
for singing is a great hobby for seniors in several perspectives , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German senior league .
most seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people &apos;s joy in music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular interaction you can establish social contacts and cultivate .
because often social and family structures develop in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrange to arrange and organize themselves on the other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this is exercising a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life and not as fast as the pu@@ zz@@ ling .
even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
to older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal community of the senior organisations .
in older generations , the united S@@ ingen had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , it explains .
tend to be observed often that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through li@@ ed@@ lyrics and special melodies , itself denied people in long rec@@ laimed events .
in singing , the head will also be asked for a special achievement , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practice not just focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : when I take long for something , I become better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing is so enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - with 50 decl@@ ines people , who sounds there when a sound goes off ?
in search of the suitable offer Sen@@ iors has various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior fen@@ nel , you can simply join .
many cities also offer views of choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can apply directly to the church or church officials .
many senior citizens can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the internet may ask the family , friends or neighbours around the Inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ ach ck .
anyone wanting to sing , should necessarily join a choir that H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul good and has something wrong - this is true of any age .
cats react sensitive as cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the herd of cat @-@ babies for adult animals has .
to her surprise , the mus@@ sels also did not let the males have cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always equal .
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens at the heart of the babies .
they respond to ten percent more quickly on foli@@ age of kittens that have been found in great distress , such as scientists have found out of the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males are also responding to the call@@ ings of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the chew@@ ing of less and strong reg@@ isters for the males are either not acceptable or not of meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C E@@ volution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the kittens with the urgency of their help is distinguished .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal conservation of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a charge of little ones that were taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
on the other they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which have additionally been raised up .
the researchers regard their results in spite of the low sampling procedure for meaningful .
&quot; all the females , even those who have not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned faster to loud@@ speaker when this Ru@@ fe played the very aroused kittens .
this ability could possibly be innate or develop together with the sex .
&quot; a surprise was that the males were re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o .
in the past , scientists have already been investig@@ ating the reactions of women and men in baby di@@ sts .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o reported in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , against the An@@ sti@@ gen Football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ę@@ r had been en@@ acted as an arrest warran@@ t .
he will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after Putin trial , Turkey will once again take place an important football match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the Du@@ el of Arch@@ du@@ es between visits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in the suspension of the extermination after the overthrow in July the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ h@@ ers should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspi@@ ci@@ ble to the motion of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup .
the football does not stop in front of the football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ g@@ r , the Pro@@ secution issued an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South America living in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver should be adher@@ ents to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the President of Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup .
although the first time is valid for 90 days , it is still alive until October , in fact that the life of the most Turks has no effect on the life of the Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country Erdogan is declared on Wednesday at the end of Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split in followers and enemies from Erdogan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club &quot; visits are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks was on the face of dramatic experience in the history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
there even the fans agree - regardless of whether you are beating heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or si@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will especially come back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates , in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has completed the season an excellent way and his team backed the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the disappointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ round kno@@ b@@ out in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; shows the &quot; lions &quot; in the Europe league early .
in the South of Li@@ g it was only enough to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Col@@ kt@@ as , the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who voted the base of the 14th title with 26 season .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez came under contract with the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario is to come to us , he must just say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief of Fi@@ ghting Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this would have to be ready to for@@ ego some one @-@ third of its estimated 7.5 million Euros about one third of its worth 7.5 million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes do not have medals opportunities for Olympics in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice as of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh at it - they are struggling in Rio to get medals .
the topic D@@ oping indicates the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock her star@@ vation shortly before playing , was ch@@ illed off at her start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ ess .
it was a sk@@ il@@ ery scene : with a set smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
as a fact that she will not get gold , the audience broke out into a jub@@ il@@ storm .
however , there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics past .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial characters in athle@@ tics .
it was closed two times for dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympi@@ ator runs from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered as the greatest challenge from U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ans and seven @-@ day world cup had to be disman@@ tled in 2010 after taking the intake of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong dentists , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 2012 , World Championships in 2013 and Europe was tested positively to the vo@@ iced stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic tre@@ k the blur@@ red intake and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the great gol@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Games and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested in 2010 positive and 21 months was blocked .
a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible , de@@ fy Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m from the so far fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete have been detected so many medals .
thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after being conducted with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to leave Olympia silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also realized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games 2008 , due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , he is situated on rank two of the world &apos;s list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world teacher and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested only in May , but must nevertheless start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world championship in that morning clu@@ es were found on the intake of a forbidden dietary supplement , the spar@@ re of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell out and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian mar@@ es viol@@ ates - multi @-@ deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
you have suffered inter@@ c@@ ages and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again .
your return trip I planned for the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the vacation island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Foreign Ministry is in continuous contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok downtown Hua H@@ in , we were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening at a hillside of two bombs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian people , three Germans , three down@@ lands and three Italians .
Friday early then two explo@@ sives went high , so according to the authorities another man was killed .
also by Ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
at the deto@@ on@@ ation near the popular Bad@@ est@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was violated .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country explo@@ ded a further bomb that killed a city council .
the spr@@ ite was according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the prec@@ inct of the coast police went into the air .
finally , Det@@ on@@ ations were called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several injured .
one comes from a link with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attack carry the same hand , &quot; said Army &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ days Friday prior to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but most likely it is the actions of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for bombing mus@@ li@@ ous separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one depends on the fact that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities would have received secret advice on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in the last days - however , they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places .
it is not yet unclear which group behind the attacks .
the police pointed out its officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment venues .
in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace , which was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the turbulent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommen@@ ding to his homepage to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ cky and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risks ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday returned a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta .
this adm@@ its the military influence even over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs are an attempt to sti@@ ce chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which in 2014 had seized the power after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers itself to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it has not succeeded in getting a grip for the military rebels since years in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , Bangkok was killed in an attack on a popular Hindu ( purely 20 people ) - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Ministry for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the Constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists have also asked the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for efforts against the liber@@ ative democratic fundamental order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional protection Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ oned the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the migrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in the extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we are monitoring the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Constitutional Court in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the country &apos;s offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally try to speak extremis@@ ts , speaking them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ e music .
the identities of the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremism .
that is not a real advertising for your own cause .
the propaganda should address the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently it had given reports of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not find evidence .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind will be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , their target device is changing and so extrem@@ ist .
the key factors is , therefore , whether such persons will have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase of legally @-@ motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and Refu@@ ge@@ es , Ma@@ d@@ ate , he would not speak of new law in this regard .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ al group .
it can be quite sure that further rectangular group@@ ings or mini@@ groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee centres or attack from other far @-@ right motives .
but a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of leg@@ acies is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate was worried that many gri@@ ps came into the account of people who have not appeared before in the right scene .
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on Asyl@@ um were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes previously with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left wing failed to radic@@ alised by far @-@ right m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the easily overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ it was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a back@@ standing of 48 seconds followed his lecture and captured the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not a sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special right law from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
as in ae@@ dic@@ s the most sports@@ men run , belon@@ gings simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sh@@ re@@ names made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media signed it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the rest of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; charity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comparisons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
unforgettable was the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in a advance over 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
fren@@ e@@ tic was fired at the time .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the game and had never seen such a long distance before the competition .

he signed the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party ever more and more resistance came up .
post office increases in trading with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric car @-@ vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is apparently great .
the mail is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter too .
in the nut@@ shell , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office intends to offer its electric transpor@@ ter from the coming year as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been tested for months now , whether they develop their own advanced Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and cars , to sell also to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said it always give inquiries , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner will soon enter into the mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ production factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and layer .
Ger@@ des had announced the Group to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and share a complete switch to the environment @-@ friendly vehicles over the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we reloc@@ ate the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active in Germany since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P @-@ guide will step forward after having lost business figures
the consumer research @-@ based Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the set@@ back suddenly appeared - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research @-@ based Gf@@ K thought that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann was all the more uncertain , the longer the successes have promised .
turbul@@ ence at the helm of Nuremberg company Gf@@ K : after once again betrayed financial figures and the res@@ ignation of the company governance is the worldwide number five of the industry in front of a personalized catch @-@ catch .
G@@ FR@@ P leader wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mah@@ m@@ illing is already counting on the board of the supervisory board already with effect from September 12 .
the management board at the Management Board already over@@ take the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor was found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the reason for the review , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted to not name a business speaker on Friday .
who will in future be the market research group , be still unclear .
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circle it was on Friday , with the shareholders , last , the disappointment about the continued success of years ago initiated restruc@@ tured .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring is not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; , called it .
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case at BMW , it would also make the queu@@ es so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company had failed to stop its loss in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent below the level of the same quarter of the year .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million euros decreased by 3.4 per cent .
earnings in the second quarter are largely charged with the right value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
in the Consumer Experience division , the Group &apos;s value @-@ de@@ preci@@ ation of 139 million Euros was a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
Gf@@ K had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - bus slip in Kru@@ mm@@ ed n in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
in an accident of a travel with 43 seniors as passengers , on Thursday in Kar@@ pac@@ ed n ( county of Aur@@ i ) eight people have been wounded .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injury , shared the police with .
the 66 @-@ year old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to leave their data according to a counter@@ ing len@@ ght that drove some parts on the counter .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a speaker in the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liber@@ ates the in@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six rescue car and an emergency rate came to an accident at the national road 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ final passengers have been brought back to the P@@ ew@@ sum district by a regular bus service .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the burdens and potential witnesses to report on the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of water are starting 1 October 2016 for the wast@@ ew@@ ater area Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ v@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( until now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( until now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ew@@ ater fee will then increase once again if appropriate correc@@ tions are necessary .
after a full @-@ day calculation the wast@@ ew@@ ater price in Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found by the approval of the budget by the land Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems have ar@@ isen .
the Kas@@ endorf market is required due to its legal basis , to operate the facilities in size .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises from world wars , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the w@@ allet .
the ag@@ it@@ ator increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of fees for the se@@ wage systems of the Swiss community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or sub @-@ covers from the previous calendar period are equal .
the engra@@ ving en@@ ag@@ it@@ ator raised Schmidt therefore that it can be used in all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very low wage se@@ wage treatment that stood between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , due to the small distribution basis , for example , it would affect the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the san@@ itation in all three systems is easily declined .
further due to its age in the return period during all three plants , they were not least due to its age and repair expendi@@ tures in a significant extent .
the complex in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ch , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by the mechanical ventilation system due to an absence of damage .
in the p@@ umping station , nearly 20 years old conve@@ ying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and in the pond position Lop@@ p had to be turned into operation of the first baby @-@ pond , which provides for almost 20 years and an additional capacity to be implemented in order to be able to meet water @-@ legal requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary application , the advanced super@@ visor and maintenance costs were to be considered accordingly in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which is still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the three systems the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the three plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thereby , added Schmidt , the market @-@ community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants in the past 20 years remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the aforementioned lines will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses on the long term , especially as the supply area of the san@@ itation @-@ area Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal could not be expanded by these facilities , because it is a deficit of deficit .
Bulgaria au@@ dition@@ ing for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , when positive 0,@@ 2 % were fully booked .
the annual average flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) in comparison to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 was compared to December 2015 ) amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed in July 2016 : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,@@ 7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect was critic@@ ised as Asian caric@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this Filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tizing against breeds .
with its filter tool , it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a piece of Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are dis@@ flo@@ wering , especi@@ al tools that generate more than 30 million euros per day .
all the failures to the public are to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised the past criticism in which they were accused of using the app Black@@ face formal or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week several users proposed a filter that gave them sle@@ dding , false teeth and di@@ sen@@ ess che@@ eks , there were some critics of a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asian - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
they wondered if this controversy sur@@ passed on a bigger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and the revol@@ t were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have disabled the feature disabled .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as homage to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as a caric@@ ature of A@@ sians .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ od@@ is@@ che@@ es .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American student , whose twe@@ et was widely used by the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and eased unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the fil@@ tering effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ sighted , but that the yel@@ lowing was pulled to the extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people who are committed to race as their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters generates an image that is abu@@ sive for a user , &quot; so it is much harder to remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to clear her sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that r@@ ack@@ able controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the interfer@@ ing with Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other colored colors that work there , but do not feel at positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat , mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there was Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his associates but according to a consultation , the company recently focused on a personnel responsible , focused on sub@@ ordinate population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said in turn that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military trans@@ duc@@ ting ISIS &apos; intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command have changed the landmark information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual states of the place would have allowed the Congress to vote in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , Intelligence , and the Wehr@@ macht , reported by major dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies , reported how for@@ ested their estimates regarding the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence services typically ab@@ stain@@ ed from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren typically , signed a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual states on site and were thoroughly investigated as analyses of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the managers at Cent@@ Com are ranging from to the top priority of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed continuous problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct indication that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their supervis@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com also announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mozambique could begin already in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress ( s ) from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the tops of Central Command changed the thoughtful reports to run the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in life , after which we have played , analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed through detailed knowledge during the investigations .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the German Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , following some of the conclusions adopted by Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating re@@ plac@@ ements to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest democr@@ at in coma , member in the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ port@@ edly reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had less space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. ship and Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had no evidence of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August the New York Times reported by an investigation by the inspec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded according to complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Defense Department welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ators have beyond the question of a successful aviation campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ oring military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the en@@ act@@ ate information about the Islamic State remind us of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw the recommendations of many analysts just a little crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to provide claims by government agencies , that contrary to the statements of the government of air pollution , did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this realization however was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ an Command @-@ holders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans will ban@@ ish with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
however , it knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which one of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ placed won a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game will go on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host , four years after they landed over the past London games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sle@@ ger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a member of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the kay@@ ak .
then came the year 2012 , in which she and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working time in London that we have now .
we have the helm completely on it .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand out of the Middle @-@ range .
India was at stake in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprising and kept the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game in their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and lu@@ te the ball into the gate for the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the p@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who have previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is also , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ es@@ capable of gaining a rapid season between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic fen@@ ack@@ et itself would be a burning down , which is handed over from the wr@@ ist@@ band to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour on the queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ shop without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ li@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s s@@ warm with gr@@ in@@ ers , could have been sent by these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time , created by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ advertisements when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air@@ brush @-@ shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest swimming and may have reign for a long time .
but if I should do modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it was noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked , did not know that there is an Olympi@@ as at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
even though the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline , and until 2012 there had been an athlete who has made it up to the final dogs .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline has a certain outdoor char@@ ms , partly because it sounds suitable for an enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an indispensable enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gymn@@ asium and diving , the two sports that unites it essentially .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ ave and sal@@ tos ) before they end up on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympi@@ ans for execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ four athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the common Olympic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward , and dr@@ above , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , upwards and down on the playground .
they do not only chase the sc@@ ell@@ line or the output wall , but in the television transfer also another height @-@ height goal : the one of the world or the Olympi@@ ad ords .
the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I think about when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ moving movement is not the destination .
he or she pr@@ all@@ u@@ ated , apparently wei@@ ght@@ lessness as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ less again upwards .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no w@@ ault in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant ul@@ cer@@ am@@ ination of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
the qualification and end of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the En@@ dr@@ unden as part of an afternoon @-@ bloc of 2 days from 14 : 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one , which is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil .
if the increase in consciousness can only be obtained through the o@@ gling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner would have recently proposed - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his following air rin@@ se , new fan@@ club .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA

witnesses say that the prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police in shame .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
over the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last few months protests against the government have sh@@ ook themselves in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses cast that polic@@ emen were shot and killed .
in the re @-@ run video about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , are showing how safety people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ bag against a wall .
the head of the UN Agency for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will be even harder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get as much Western aid .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a respectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pend@@ ant train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , wher@@ eu@@ si@@ dents were finally sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven to the w@@ aging of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and these do not have any other options except prot@@ esting it , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Eth@@ ics .
the entire youth was prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom @-@ up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a broad election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and now they control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , the tension along the border into Eritrea ; a battle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for June hundreds of lives .
analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts have been imposed over the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been more or less forced over the past few years , using turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of indign@@ ation after years of moving ahead are now explo@@ ded .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very many Ethiop@@ ians able to communicate with the social media because cheap smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate via Internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that conc@@ eal where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they assembled themselves to the protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mainly Christian High @-@ countries , in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims live and live in flat @-@ areas .
but also this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that constitute around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military , in trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ contracted illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts are saying that he was particularly engaged in using early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers to process opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; the current regime lack it in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen by relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr Hai@@ tian maritime comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time they experienced such a rebellion was 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested , according to indications of analytical seems to have been de@@ fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following raz@@ ors , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it were less than in recent months , and this time of un@@ rest went relatively fast .
Ethiop@@ a lob@@ al Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure , like the new pend@@ ant train , as well as for their measurable advances in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
the last month protests of the gon@@ fly in Gon@@ dar , a sham@@ anic city , led by Tig@@ ray , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media .
analy@@ st say that the protests in the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
the American administration used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ ym for the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want its allies to collap@@ sed in a already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; congratulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to all@@ ay the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign , by attacking his repeatedly reiter@@ ated alleg@@ ation , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fying statement creates new questions concerning the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate for re@@ public@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand the American public .
it also brings his collaborators , who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection , to explain the peculiar position , statements that he might not have meant at all .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was back with respect to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intended to mention the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , on which Mr. Tru@@ mp told in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr Tru@@ mp wanted to help to mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by trying him to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the republi@@ can presidential system .
the last storm of the criticism scre@@ ened to Mr. Tru@@ mp while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of the response of its response .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this issue again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ically would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
at the end of July he was a strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but later he said &quot; Of course I mean the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then re @-@ establish when needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages can be taken by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication specialist in the language of both candidates .
but I believe it is cle@@ verly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of taking the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an add @-@ up note , as its diver@@ ging values continue to go back .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a tour with great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp in general seeks to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while it rein@@ forces the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ z@@ s have brought his loyal fellow stre@@ et@@ into the un@@ comfortable situation to stand up to him no matter how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani so he was interviewed for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in that sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ singers , completely wrong and therefore it came to pass , because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister , it allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them up on each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ca@@ vities the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who tried to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You Can &apos;t miss it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ ck about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only one more proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once over the price of the market , Café is returned in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash , which was not a Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , put the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people mour@@ ned to be the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ed wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still don &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also a re @-@ invention .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , helped a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same Distri@@ but@@ or for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are wardro@@ bes , such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural sweet@@ ness .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez , he noticed a st@@ amped stream on old tribal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed out of Williamsburg &apos;s prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after she was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way up .
after the verb , she gave a while the coffee left , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that was liked to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee@@ ee a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inv@@ ari@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not accept Gro@@ d@@ ll that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for verb with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go ahead of their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the Café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has imagined it soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site has further advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally would like to fill the cold spra@@ yed coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new ampli@@ fier is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief customer and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
as the new café opened , Wh@@ ole said that the entry of the Lok@@ als and the Best@@ els felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ sch@@ ild@@ r@@ o@@ dle sou@@ ps .
its menu on this day was a bit modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato @-@ pu@@ ree and as dessert a sti@@ men@@ pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ kers .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; treated by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Zi@@ egel@@ man told her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
your latest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they demonstrated culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ acking @-@ free Imb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh food wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ree and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ str@@ ates , this found the couple for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ ol@@ ut bread , liver cheese and sav@@ ory bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper which has the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed himself in the stomach and lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male rock work and it was served freshly baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who were star@@ ving food on star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sets the paths with which the country turned out to be no more the Sch@@ ed@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beg@@ gar Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new budget of bud@@ get@@ own : mysterious food like lo@@ aves and cold cuts were found to stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as a &quot; wonderful way , vinegar remains , &quot; mer@@ ging Zi@@ egel@@ man to hide from the cooks of un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients with a creative sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying tables .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became one of the fourth luxury .
peculiar mixtures have been tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular addition on lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man continues to perform : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the farm recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary economic development - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the eating behaviour of the country is so good .
by re@@ assur@@ ing the articles and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become a &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , pamp@@ as , as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots to transform into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ eating attitude .
while he made public the simple Iowa farm &apos;s cuisine with his kitchen , spe@@ iste he has become like the millions of millions of world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried out a smo@@ king .
he was a glorious realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt could have committed the same error if not his wife Ele@@ anor had asked him to re@@ construct his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the accused of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted meals . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected , once the country returned to the legs .
the leg@@ acies is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave to better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of windsurfing .
after the dishes were evacu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert , which they had dressed at home : the pl@@ ast@@ ray , the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt did eat .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a nasty twist to send their recipes a name to be missed .
there was no s@@ wollen cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
every di@@ pped slightly reluct@@ antly one spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a descend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few har@@ dened Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when bombs was killed , he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others to life .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old had died on a façade attack by the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , who has saved lives according to picture newspapers so far about 6@@ 0.000 people .
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own life in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil leader , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said according to image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yrs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bombar@@ d@@ ment in Syria .
the helicopter have rejected four façade bombs over the Alzheimer adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory emergency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest vor@@ tex is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to finish .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna @-@ S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland won &apos;t get up with 150 years of age .
leis@@ ur@@ ely swi@@ ms the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic coast , in an hour it comes on average at 220 feet far .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal .
this characteristic of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for cycl@@ amen .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist had long been that Greenland can be st@@ ony stone .
only missing the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface in winter only .
researchers know how little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
your time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ o measure she , as she saw before S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transm@@ itter .
loot still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw @-@ bones of a young ice @-@ bears .
possibly you chase them sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ eres and seek car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland ha@@ ie that lived from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a che@@ que from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres .
to as@@ certain the age of animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of eye lens already occurs before the birth of shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be re@@ done later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ers .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear @-@ weapon @-@ attempt larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon atoms to the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest beast the lin@@ ers contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland ha@@ ie in their lin@@ ers had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland , an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland , however , received offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers were able to assign the length to an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably due to the threshold of the sex mature and its age was determined with 15@@ 6 years , Greenland deals with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
also this might be the most likely world ch@@ ord for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme living above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland wal , in whose bac@@ on on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on lace , was captured before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism living there are living in as@@ fl@@ are .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal bu@@ cks heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as much as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .

after the property of land , par@@ cel@@ ing and execution questions , and the applications for measurement could be clarified , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße ) to prospective buyers can no longer exist in the way .
the common@@ place is convinced that the b@@ acks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and stock@@ pil@@ ing seniors alike .
as it was meant to announce building contractors immediately in the town hall , the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to request further enquiries for the relocation of further commercial farms , associated with the creation of jobs , to be able to rev@@ ise the municipal council , which will only alter in the spring of this year , to change the available space plan operations in sub @-@ areas .
thus , in the area of Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n , this trade area has already been extended by two plots in direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city at the Main has therefore presented its best opportunities in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ ni@@ ons , head of excellence of excellence and real estate markets of I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether it is allowed to run banks further from London from financial transactions across the EU .
they have so far sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport in the United Kingdom .
this is the use of major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ bying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main R@@ s five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , outlines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg must cover a large fund @-@ industry , spir@@ ited but also like Dublin from the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to get to Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
furthermore , the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands .
in addition to the Seine , rents for first @-@ class commercial properties around 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer &apos;s consultancy , the town is up to seven , Luxembourg to No.@@ 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit vote on the economic researchers .
for this , the correlation of forces : in London worked according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead will receive legal costs from the H@@ CV C patent stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ office decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has been entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ cal C legal dispute with the Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated from a claim payment of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents in Mer@@ ck in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge , a pattern of failures from Mer@@ cks , including the expression of other non @-@ ethical acts .
in the survey of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. official in Beth @-@ Lab@@ an Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to demol@@ ish the cost that was created during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case will go back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took one another , claiming their property to laboratory work , Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

clinics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton has published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , revealed by the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax exemp@@ tion of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ ique USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes , primarily to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the State Department .
Clin@@ t Candi@@ dates for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax articles in the last ten years .
you paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ically fighting hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a cr@@ ust contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false interpre@@ tations and pul@@ lers with respect to his previous promises to release his tax articles .
it is common for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax articles , although they are not obligated by law due to this purpose .
Tru@@ mp , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a reason for his ref@@ usal to see a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of publishing the Presidential did@@ atin of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special consultant , to CN@@ N that he won &apos;t allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not completed .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , among other things , the Republi@@ can French President did@@ acy of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that its ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , its donations for charitable organisations , his business@@ men and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already released a video on the Internet and released a video on the internet in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp for publishing his tax return .
on Thursday she talked about the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential system has done in recent decades and publish its tax articles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid any or only very few taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times zi@@ pped on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
Bundes@@ taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor war@@ like buff@@ ett that would ensure people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alised glomer@@ ate has his seat at Tru@@ mp for a meeting to share their tax articles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett was also subjected to a tax examination of IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have undergone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ ically campaign will return tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they referred only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most of all the Americans .
their main terrain was a cost @-@ effective index funds from which the Clin@@ ically dividen@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ 000 was controlled .

Jewish director Mar@@ ks Berliner hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; arab@@ ic &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots disp@@ en@@ ched a media pit , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel has no Israeli pre@@ election in Berlin as it requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &apos; Sho@@ ah &apos; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country side list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; Tri@@ ded him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said the site said that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ished in the director , even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ selection is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied at this event and troubled .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this has added to this hotel chain in Germany is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident prov@@ oked a fairly big resonance on the internet in which people called for a sc@@ andal .
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had given the alleged requirement of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; ashamed to you , &quot; it said in another post in which it was noted that the hotel , which stands at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a Synago@@ gue .
the hotel quickly reported all alleg@@ ations of herself and called for the incident to &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel did not record in the quick @-@ down list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung writes a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ uer@@ us against the demonstrators .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran , in the year , is equivalent to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , shared the ambassador .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , the further commercial ship@@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 amoun@@ ted to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million in 2015 .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and bet@@ ted $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commercial recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reached by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year the Russian foreign representative were around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel agencies , Iranian people .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; he said .
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .

the Min@@ ist@@ rants from the past@@ oral unit E@@ ase tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ney of all Min@@ ist@@ rants in the last two years , the Ober@@ min@@ ist@@ ran@@ round of St. Anna has decided to prepare for the preparation and execution of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage targets have been tested and decided finally for the bish@@ ops of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , there was a special pilgrimage for mercy in the open Münster , which was offered a special pilgrimage .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ a bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stadt rose on the way .
in the evening , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where there is also a Münster iner@@ ary wife , and so the pilgrimage has been approached by the Münster .
the single day tours were measured in the morning and evening according to a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and writing .

the deserved reward was a joint grip on the beach in the evening .
after the morning in the fourth pilgrimage in the imposing mon@@ k church in St. Peter , it went to Freiburg .
clearly facilitated and happy the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burg Münster , and passed the gate of mercy .

scar@@ f Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , as a Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the Men &apos;s team Sprint in Rio for glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role played , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ ings .
they repeated the trick after they took in March at the railways Championships in London despite the decline of Ho@@ ys only a modest eighth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the substitute of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a note .
ho@@ ys moved a gap , which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which she stayed when she saw potential in the car@@ rots that has un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ s - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification rounds of a Olympi@@ ad record , but in the still@@ s they won the New Zealand in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
he was short back after his lap but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner was holding it .
a strategy shift made a great deal of transformation , in the execution in a higher gear to slow it down , and to enable him to keep it Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they went on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have set up a Olympi@@ arian ch@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave addition to that he fell on the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England ri@@ vals .
with so much victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the stands like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team for the last three months .
we are so poorly managed with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months is that we expect successful five days at Vel@@ o@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it &apos;s in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y was born , who was also born on March 23 ( one apparently native date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a mare of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ es@@ ome to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ est competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ zer @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race .
you arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won 2012 in London Gold , lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where the Wig@@ gins will be on the ground .
he had made himself yesterday with warned of the qualification as he called his function@@ aries to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , continued and ended tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Row@@ y S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ved soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and bring a push to medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been rund@@ own .
it also played drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical leit@@ ner Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April is surrounded by sex@@ is@@ mus@@ es and bullying and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , when one sees itself the first evening of competition in Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks quite like that , then the legendary call of GB@@ s that has reached the perfect moment to return to its peak .
the future of the m@@ elt of Portland because of the lifting of energy production
the future of the al@@ um@@ mel@@ tdown of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - standing on the game , since the plant operators terminate the energy supplier contract and thereby raise complete supply agreements , such as the supplier &apos;s energy provider .
this step followed the decision of the government at Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
one for 20 years , Sub@@ mission has been running in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed at a closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ Eff@@ ective since the mel@@ ting was consumed around 10 percent of the total generation of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
2014 Al@@ coa closed the point of Henry mel@@ ting , which led last year to a closure of the an@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ ali dollar and finally due to its electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium sm@@ el@@ ter with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which will hold the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means more physical demand for electricity by mel@@ ting means &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the agreements called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have to come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation period , so that they will end up in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this , AG@@ L also assumes that the contracts in financial year 17 will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 currently are limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale dealers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the Treaties in its annual amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or to ensure the power supply to the m@@ elt &apos;s . &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it had completed a 20 year treaty with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have been in force from November this year , even if it is still guilty , why it was res@@ igned by the treaty .
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic relationships of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mich@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland yearly uses approximately 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and tom@@ ago about 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generating set , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Car@@ d@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the vo@@ gue edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ner and mother of the Car@@ di@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sep@@ em@@ ber@@ ds of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on its Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers for crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ ol@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problems of ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn , as well as in the presence of the most common Show bi@@ z on@@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as the cover of her sister &apos;s cover and that ends with a classic twist : they have all planned a surprise party .
that represents the kl@@ is@@ che@@ e@@ ti@@ ch@@ un@@ ed plot nearly every birthday sep@@ tics of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; Du bad@@ ger that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 am ) , but Kris had to participate her other girls somehow to this publicity .
with a view to the September of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ ain began .
K@@ end@@ all great sister Kim likes them , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ em@@ ber@@ ies of the magazine is a League for itself .
the sep@@ tum &apos;s output is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a girth which resembles more a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , from the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars is so si@@ gh@@ tly anticip@@ ating that over the last two years , pictures of the magazine has yet been dra@@ gging before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover , cover Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , the mod@@ alities &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; that are celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize and conductor Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the minor chance that Ms Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous individuals or even reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it all applies to Jen@@ ners ) .
they are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade , had one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , Jen@@ ners &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with their reality @-@ TV @-@ history Jen@@ ners &apos; position was always somewhat tense in the fashion world .
in June the En@@ sti@@ ff Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ le@@ pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again high , when the news came out with the shows Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the dis@@ grace , it seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Vo@@ gue edition of the Vo@@ gue .
in the tru@@ est sense of the word it is a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell images of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she can see in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres annually show 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the countries are annually rejected by the municipal council centres , while the industry pus@@ hes the effects of further medium @-@ cuts to already over@@ cost transactions .
in Queensland , there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , victims of violence and those who have no funds for odd Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vers and those who have no means for odd Del@@ o@@ gi@@ vers and those who seek free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the community , which are already over@@ ly arranged , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year it is intended that these legal centers will lose more than 30 percent of their resources .
the director of the community service centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Council centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without the lifting of the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; que@@ ens community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ manage@@ able and humili@@ ating debts , families who have been dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the German government will cut the funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland have to be forced to pay with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and federal minister and sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these center@@ ations immediately so that people can get the help they need , in legal problems .
last year , the state government filled their commitment to lift funds for legal average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their customer communities , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k has invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on EU elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the following elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U .
this made representative surveys of the opinion research scientist IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government co @-@ operation in the north is just under construction , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have a good chance to continue to stand the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent to 24 percent a five years ago .
according to pol@@ l the party is only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the African .
the left would come to 19 per cent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , and the Af@@ D would be at 19 per cent for the first time in the country .
the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ant despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) to the heav@@ iner tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey showed only 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
at the same time they are still standing behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previous 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ u@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : a 20 years ago , the Nokia communic@@ ator came on the market .
the successor to dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite klo@@ sty .
the built @-@ in store was at the beginning eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ ytes with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Age .
20 years ago , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product for a few months previously at the CeBIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the west @-@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was communic@@ ator to achieve .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , albeit agon@@ izing slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could have imagined in August of 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and executed .
the market today dominate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere be online , this is today for very many people everyday .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices have been sold , based on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
worldwide sales with the tools is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running operations of the countless App providers and the telecommunications companies .
the entire industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Steve Jobs announced Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , everything per touch screen easy to use .
the victories of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Len@@ ovo and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the offspring .
it disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
in the cut , each German now appears 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to give the smartphone a time away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s ball , in the Siemens @-@ Board for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England need to direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me it was the largest attraction of he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
we will be able to achieve new opportunities for local and companies near He@@ a@@ throw new possibilities .
for our local communities we will already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es to create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ gly and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any given question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on weather growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw that has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , which was selected for five years in a row to the world &apos;s leading airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run @-@ cat@@ g , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time we can direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw and create our future trade and create a legacy from skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ game &quot; on indicator block
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies working with online advertising money coming according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to byp@@ ass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat@@ er@@ - and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block indicator @-@ ups on its Des@@ k@@ top@@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus , published in the program that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that his dis@@ agreements would change enco@@ ding regarding his adver@@ tis@@ ation , in order to display it adver@@ ts the detection on which part of the page is advertising to be difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block announced that there has been a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ struggle between the an@@ zei@@ ted open source community and the byp@@ ass has already been ongoing since the invention of advertisers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has settled into the fight is a strong indi@@ z as worrying as worrying about the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people re@@ tire re@@ lock@@ ers , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access Facebook over their mobile devices makes hand@@ y@@ earnings up 84 percent of the advertising revenue from Fac@@ ebooks .
the company has put it on display blocks on desktop PCs since mobile advertising blocks did not block any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobil@@ iser app for social network and inst@@ agram , divided one speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs is making an ample large share of revenues so that Facebook seems to be an investment in such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared with that it would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad prepar@@ atory tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that an add @-@ up new filter would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blocks are a stupid means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control in the hands of the people .
women in suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call for a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a thought @-@ su@@ icide from several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the canton of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman put himself in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets and were taken by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said .
it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 years , made by several vehicles , including a truck , was over@@ riding , even wanted to kill themselves .
it was still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who calls these as well as each witnesses of the incident to announce themselves .
a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clash prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists do not have to assume that a pedestrian is going in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the neg@@ ligence killing was acqu@@ itted after she was driving a man and killed that in August 2014 was one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court noted that the poli@@ cem@@ an answer -- which had responded to an emergency call -- in an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in Morges , should report on the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate Change : Venus was once more hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once more hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ bled those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been di@@ pped in similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow@@ ing rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have a thin , er@@ ted @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly revol@@ ved .
the model also lit up the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet was probably dis@@ liked more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to lodge life and protect them from quicker .
the early Venus pro@@ filed also from a sun that was 30 per cent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow@@ ing rotation of Venus is almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the sun heating .
the result is average temperatures , some degree of cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles its evolution that was previously suspected by Plan@@ etary scientists .
although she was once more hab@@ itable , Venus -- has been exposed to much heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years .
her oceans hid and her water vap@@ or was burned down by ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ xi@@ on turned only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , and led to a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed that decision and mer@@ ging that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed by the 50 years of Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he must also have a determination of decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic that Roy has stopped at the end of May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions for the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been honoured during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was struck in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season during each of the last years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the wild for a second game spot in the Western Conference by five points .
Roy of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart won Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
nor@@ we@@ t@@ öl@@ workers resume talks on , strike strike
the labour @-@ struggles concerning the repar@@ ation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ workers are exposed , while all the parties are set to sit down for a new round of discussion , they said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field providers - Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ames unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of current spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start the beginning of next year to re@@ address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened this year to its contracts in North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rating of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in companies need the needed room to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries because it is ration@@ alised by its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ collaboration with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower commodities under pressure , an economic situation which had reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament@@ arians Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion euros will be expected to cover new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler sets red @-@ rate from stars in the star @-@ christ@@ ening of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler &apos;s space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star @-@ shop of the ple@@ ads .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star@@ star cluster can rot@@ ate at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planet Earth .
&quot; we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other star@@ gates , read more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ christ@@ ening of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this star @-@ pile , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach the adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
in peak rates these po@@ ign@@ ant stars encounter big amounts of star@@ ch currents .
as these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ wing effect on the stars .
if a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ ch - like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates shows that a more intense stars turn slower than a less massive star .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a larger star slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes to rot@@ ate as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star @-@ christ@@ ening of the ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; the star @-@ christ@@ ening of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , When , When and why stars try to slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the press rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be appearing in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star starts
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days of base Base .
following his emo@@ tionally return announcement , the 41 year old professional will be held on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays , last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected as the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature , under a tenth year contract , has been enriched by 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , it serves as advisor and youth coach - in full content .
a player paid it for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ us &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics have similar values .
but in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to not be recorded .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , so controversial is the appearance outside the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the Super@@ star was invited to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to get bot@@ tled stero@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was blocked for his work in the so @-@ called bio @-@ Genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main turn@@ table , for years over an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida high @-@ promoting money .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez Ro@@ ff@@ is@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell days were not going wrong .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and with the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson said , sympathy conver@@ sions of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the followers of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team .
Olympia 2016 : C@@ hen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing rehearsal may not launch wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing waterfalls .
a blur@@ red athlete could have gained almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases became the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in C@@ hen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ters Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical nu@@ di@@ tics competitions these messages come back to time .
in C@@ hen was proved to be the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday which is used as a mas@@ king means for dop@@ ing substantial values .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time excluding the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze .
on Friday C@@ hen would have to participate in the footh@@ ills of over 50 m Fre@@ est@@ l .
C@@ hen has filed an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands of C@@ hen &apos;s full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S ) and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the me@@ tering of athletes with positive cases .
also on the night of Rio se@@ oo@@ ed the news of the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the cor@@ pse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act on the forbidden substance for the EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was made provisional , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been very positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister , Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov and his criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ ah .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t drag the right steps , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bul@@ gar@@ en stand under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
thus , approximately every weight of weight may not be part of the chron@@ ically @-@ stressful nation in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known as the London Olympi@@ ans in class to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive to the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both dispute the intake , but they are not allowed to launch in class to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics is particularly the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa a further severe blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Cup IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ ists of Kenya in Rio has produced numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the former settlements in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between the athletes .
thus , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio .
sun rose in the centre of an argument with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested in the Chinese Championships positive to the stimul@@ ant of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ ashe@@ ets : so per@@ fi@@ de presses your ran@@ som
programmers of obtaining mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes amongst 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies were at least once , partly repeatedly victim to an attack with black@@ smith software .
in Germany , just 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims paid to the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetrators are specialized in compres@@ sing their black@@ smith software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes with an impact on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially saving ran@@ som is much higher than in private use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of harm software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators are discovered for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , private use was the target , but the transition to company att@@ acs was frigh@@ tening over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim active , they look for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ smith .
to get the end turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
but where in private use the personal photo database is at stake , there are companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off , if a ran@@ som@@ ware is attributed to .
22 percent of the German firms affected resulting sales loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt the business , in one case people were in life @-@ threatening .
in Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , pay their data again .
for managers it is difficult , given a stal@@ em@@ ate in the operation the claim to reject the perpetrators .
the h@@ ackers in turn know that and try to establish a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure the utility surfaces and contact with the pres@@ pres@@ sions are examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they declare their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support websites or en@@ code for example files .
and will be able to redeem private persons after payments of a few hund@@ red@@ th euros , businesses must have some tough negotiation and five digits to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware coverage , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains security professionals Ch@@ ester @-@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , however , is that it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ants in the form of a software building on the actual black@@ smith .
the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware themselves , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased .
&quot; this package includes a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be altered , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the pres@@ criptions are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to distribute the freshly made software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
thus , you log in one of the forums on the underground , buys the set of a criminal , and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per each calcul@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals do become cl@@ amp with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 per cent of the companies should be able to trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey , to rep@@ el the ran@@ som@@ ware via file back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful creation , the perpetrators are instead known with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes manager Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential , depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before .
the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control over the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter the activ@@ ist of a so @-@ called heating so many victims could certainly be a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might also be a topic in industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday .
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds pretty un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortable , only the cock@@ pit top is falling down there .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V reservoir .
it is not only a trunk @-@ trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ rated back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the bench @-@ surfaces of the back@@ bench can be sc@@ anned out like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space that is high from the floor up to the ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high .
the suit@@ case can be well loaded , however the char@@ ger is a slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1,@@ 6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m in wide range areas very powerful .
however , he is likely to turn out his work somewhat qui@@ eter .

there is another mot@@ orization : a 1.5 @-@ l pet@@ rol with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering wheel is likely to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment is not open to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the approximately 29@@ 000 Euros for the well @-@ sto@@ cked Top @-@ diesel are in order .

Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air passengers
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only to dangers which are typical for air traffic , argued the National Park Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had a knee injury .
however , the accident could have been happening everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
dise@@ ased holiday@@ makers get money back after their trip only when the cause of the disease is doubt@@ lessly able to find in the hotel .
but that is only the case when more than ten percent of guests are proven to show the same symptoms .
in the treated case , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting for a family on the second day of its door .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage purification , which allegedly inf@@ lic@@ ed the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip had been faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained to the organis@@ ers .
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
indeed , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was in fact def@@ ective .
however , the promot@@ er experienced only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not hurt his information obligations , so the judgment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said after the violence of violence in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concerns about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be rec@@ eded and determined at the same time , to the terrorist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure : our country will not be able to answer the perpetrators of the perpetrators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we are not entitled to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , but raise the security and strength of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wishes to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personalised strengthening of security forces , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium term scale over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ iz@@ ers for terrorism must be again under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire can be removed so that especially the purchase of weapons will be placed on the internet .
the last much discussed restra@@ int for physicians should be maintained following de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how the threat of citizens can be less@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a view of psychological abnormalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister has a better social support for necessary .
teachers should better be prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of con@@ den@@ sed investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister clearly pronounced against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear @-@ polish for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
a general ban on whol@@ em@@ ing can be problematic for constitu@@ tionally .
you cannot prohi@@ bit everything you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter accused the Minister , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages and man@@ power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing Party Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of spra@@ ying and a tigh@@ tening of the common law will no longer bring people in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better road flow on the motorway exit
it looks at a regular basis on the wal@@ k@@ way - here &apos;s a picture from November .
however , this should change : the legal disp@@ ose of the law is to be extended .
this is good news for all motor@@ cyclists who are travelling in traffic on the Environ@@ ment@@ straße every night in St@@ au when they drive over the highway to drive ( A 43 ) .
the road building extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure Wes@@ eler Road to 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then run directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic does not share early , whereby the overall performance will be improved on the multi @-@ driven section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had been the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the driver &apos;s tram at the fe@@ eder v@@ ans the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days from the back traffic up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ gans and sometimes even beyond .
reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the departure hall .
from here , traffic will only be paved via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be trac@@ ed back over a period of three years ago .
the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had revealed that the bridge does not have the required hydro@@ power to absorb heavy @-@ traffic in particular .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks and the associated @-@ day traffic jam will last , the local country cannot tell .
however , it is expected to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official resi@@ dual maturity to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the pro@@ long@@ ation of the dispute , the state has deliberately chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected .
the traffic will pass on Tuesday and on Wednesday without trace of the site .
cross @-@ cultural trip : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s offers young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible Haus &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most people of the class have come between September 2015 and March 2016 among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ische images and video anim@@ ations , it had been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ ying , and the young theatre will work in the coming season as part of a music project .
from October to December young people should get young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years , professionally managed courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatri@@ cal and theatri@@ cal language schools are planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .

rain instead of star @-@ cutting : hope of weather conditions
the weather has made the star @-@ star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany during the night for Friday a St@@ ay through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was to be seen because of clouds and rain , the cel@@ estial spectacle , said the Chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather is meant to be good , then we see many star@@ ving star@@ es in the sky .
in the clu@@ sters , it is per@@ sil@@ ky , which belong to the fastest star @-@ star@@ es with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they appear to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
in the evening , you are etern@@ ally awake , at night you are awake for hours in the morning , the morning is far off to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep dormit@@ ories and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sle@@ eves , and there are many causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ &apos;s , Board member of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine .
what you see , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , so a inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y disorder .
just that can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member at the German Haus@@ Medical Association with practice in the Lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
behind it can organic , mental or mental factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rare is the sleeping disorder in a different condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ mit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors do one another .
those who for example has a band trap , can be bad , watching every two or three hours and perhaps he begins to greet you about everyday problems and -@@ worry , there are tr@@ ams an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who will not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ys way@@ .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is tired , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headaches .
to rel@@ ieve the sleep , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , amongst other things , behaviour change , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medication - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets are only used in exceptional and most suitable for two weeks .
there is hardly any sleep in Germany in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should contact at bed@@ time problems at the primary care physician , betra@@ ys white .
this can resolve by studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens there ?
for instance , to examine in the sleep laboratory medical examinations , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory tract , in sleeping @-@ fatigue , at sle@@ ek @-@ fatigue , or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
actually you do not have to prepare for the examination .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after c@@ abling , one goes to his normal time in bed .
beside the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose ri@@ lle , a chest strap and a g@@ lowing on the finger .
it also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can anyone get the problems get a grip ?
there are quite many positions on which one can put for a better sleep .
white @-@ mol@@ ded counts : regular sleeping @-@ ups and rise , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the night , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night did not look at the clock - then you start to be reck@@ oned immediately , and that is completely and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what to have the jungle with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler vo@@ iced on Facebook to disap@@ point cutting of the DS@@ V team at the Olympi@@ is .
in December 2014 he took the first gold championship in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V athlete , Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in his criticism of the ex @-@ team colleagues in his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ad gets 20,000 € premi@@ er and a jungle little 15@@ 0.000 EURO , no one should wonder about the missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on the night to Friday on his fac@@ ebook page .
the conve@@ yor system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore we cannot compete with countries who want to promote a lot and do not see exactly what they do with the topic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( Nada ) .
this is how we should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent controls of W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; asks the choice of Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream .
airport : Ban@@ de by Car@@ th@@ iev@@ es
professional R@@ am at the Airport Düsseldorf
foreigners from Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to take the detention of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed to a Ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ - and tro@@ dden @-@ pil@@ es .
at 9@@ 30 am realized civilian officials in the field of the Airport Düsseldorf , a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen made of past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and were dealt with in a collaborative manner .
the specialists of the Cri@@ al@@ kom@@ ari@@ ats 34 are able to enumer@@ ate the th@@ iev@@ es to the disp@@ at@@ ment of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
in doing so they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lenses , meanwhile have a remainder of cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight , but the police count them among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
along the road from east to west , one gets along the slots , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
at the facade of a gray house someone &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite from a Li@@ d@@ l , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals .
article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , in the last weeks , however , preferred with burning cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the residents of the rental agreements , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
in the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel in the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel had argued for a hard @-@ hard approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , which were given by Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , and three weeks reported official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , sper@@ ched parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile its renovated construction workers on behalf of the in@@ famous home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later police and builders on the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents go walking with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about wal@@ k@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a basic school and kinder@@ gartens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who are here three children , are mainly directed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house @-@ projects they share the care of rising tenants and fer@@ v@@ ation .
it does not sound like a j@@ aw that multip@@ ly police @-@ protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police between domestic workers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ fts in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional worker @-@ district , which also today in comparison with the rest of the city has a lower average age and a high risk of poverty .
also home occupied and the resulting housing projects are long for Kiev : 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR , including almost all of the whole Main Street , very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under great police court in a down@@ right road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming magne@@ ts for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : the inhabitants of the GDR , former times , and former household occupied their j@@ aw .
this is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in the sli@@ ces , or freshly coated facade , which were ki@@ cked with color .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes , as a body @-@ breaking , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the off@@ ences make Sach@@ sen@@ ces , which tend more to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a flat house next to the controversial 94 years , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is more important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , that were not intended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous fl@@ amm@@ ers cars put it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer no longer .
for the studied architect , her street is no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other with , than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
therefore it was also important to her that the inhabitants got their road back : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation above the part of the city .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to take away : through secured new buildings in former buildings , which thr@@ ong the old inhabitants .
&quot; these are ultimately property flats , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if one never list@@ ens to someone ?
it focuses on all sides of frustration , even with the police and the occup@@ ants .
for those drawn over colour @-@ bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene were among the j@@ aw .
whoever draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub that can be bad about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to be called by their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
in addition , she is a social worker @-@ worker .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , the labor of refugees , administration , public authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
so some - less ridicul@@ ously stran@@ ded as rather on the variety of desire tasks pur@@ pose@@ ful - as the management wanted to write the place .
searched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long standing experience in the field of social work , just a viable W@@ oll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on three years of extension .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ er and full @-@ time actors support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding issues .
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ enstraße .
a serious problem has been to be found for quite some time , apartments for the connecting jun@@ cture , which have been recognized .
for the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
they must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented apartment rooms .
the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ scape , at the Comm@@ une and at the job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every host wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto the administration is no private apartments .
it does not exist until now , be reli@@ ant on private apartments , so Deu@@ ter@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be visited as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agreed .
apart from a fixed base , there are inter@@ ns , educational places , school fields , one @-@ euro jobs and tut@@ oring for refugees and migrants that need to be und@@ oc@@ ated or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work at the building yard or help home@@ work , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
activity , however , does not work only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a lack of feeling .
so , there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially learning courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here management and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees got the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and allows them to over@@ bridge the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who will eventually create the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , who will never integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
there are also troubles@@ hooting , however , says customers honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others .
all that is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two most recent incidents fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; what man@@ ag@@ na may call na@@ ï@@ ve , &quot; a resi@@ dual risk and wants to shut them out .
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers but already .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks they release them completely in re@@ vocation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers need to be on the spot and in the region following activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question clearly to answer , shy the politics .
actually it is unfair to provide them hel@@ pers on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already planning to integrate the present people up to the present time .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
however , if people are in need , they should help them both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters sought
the police helicopter flew around one hour several areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are pro@@ spec@@ tively rolled into an apartment in an apartment house in an apartment house in the lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two , and struck the im@@ hol@@ s into the escape .
the two men were approximately 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters in size , well treated , both bore both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis .
they fled the direction of downtown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the flag@@ ging the police put several strings as well as a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
eventually the unknown before the apartment was close to the apartment and on their flight .
