<seg id="1">Clinically and Trumps economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's why both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential elections are however at the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep a little bit small in doubt as to how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to violate the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "he himself would be quite different, claiming to Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively drive regulations and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax practices - for private people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has given chances to open chances and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, Trump and Clinton can be almost worshipped.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, at Trump there are no cross-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power stations and return the coal production in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far-protected areas, which wants to announce the Paris climate treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its investment programme, Clinton wants to expand and calls for renewable energies: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziish Trade Agreement, they both don't want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but just protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be better paid, calls for around Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must, then he says he will not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is taking advantage of the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are holding him before, so that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least demand from the rich that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of foreign side" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announcing an official end to the eight months long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the golese room of St. Petersburg Palace in the reception, I cannot deny myself to the intruder that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles had narrow tilting, and he hardly pointed out heat, even for his back-down relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report about five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in front of the crisis, but will even improve." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day the newspaper described that Erdogan as behaved as if never had happened a little worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to imply the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin radiant, sustainable radile showed that President of President of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wrenamed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to please Russia in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decay was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Canning again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would wear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most of the most serious accusations were the accusations of leading officials that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have benefited from the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has disputed that vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all this meeting took place just because Putin received an excuse by the President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he was last month at a failed coup d near his Amtes.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal rush of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predicted the state-TV, cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agribusiness will be allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulating it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West because its response to attempts was to take power over as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued Groll will come across the Snowckentempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus to give a bonus that he sought after the coup d state support for the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit in this glorious palace at the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as a analyst once described," "" "alliance of foreign side" "" ": two countries that violate themselves from the West and feel poorly dealt with." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still differences between the two still large differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey supported contradictory sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both Presidents at the press conference predicted that they had not even striped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey balled it clearly to answer a question about their differences, whereas Putin decided to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "there is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO's member in Turkey was the Russian combat jet, it certainly is better that the two Heads of State had at least talk together again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia President Vladimir Putin, Ivanov, Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his rod of Mr Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the narroast of trust by Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as a special officer for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin without stating reasons" "" "Ivanov's dismissal has been arranged by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was founded in 2012 by Ivanov's deputy was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he finished his degree at the prestigious Staatliche Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is called (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive officer and the Office leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of head for legislative powers and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday with that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of the narrosts of Vladimir Putin's and works as he is for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the staff will return to their own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is thus the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently nobody.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president to once lead to Russian environmental policies - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in an interview to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before, he was deputy prime minister and defense minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov than one of five people he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia since Putin's second term Putin would violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching allies coup, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the whole bridge can be found at their place and the last section of Decks gets a betongation for the deck, meaning that the whole Deck is ready to be taken up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first test is a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the state-of-the-art-oriented high- and deep-construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last track record, and its connection to the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern hemisphere-bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons weighs, and at a slope of about 3% to be drawn up.</seg>

<seg id="17">The action concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.</seg>

<seg id="21">How does one like the loss of more about 1300 cheap apartments, whose support will run over the next few years?</seg>

<seg id="23">To prevent this, so the planned police spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be able to buy-in links from the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer going out to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been complained in the last decade of many beys.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go, it's about getting people out of the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer of course to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was created on the characters first created for the video games in the 1990s (later developed a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture sunk up the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was moved by massive demand that overtook the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon go more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go out with their smartphone and look for Pokémons that are followed with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation who played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that replacements the "average" person each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users reprosecuted, the Washington Post recently dealt with that within two days following the launch of the game, the number of followed people, which jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent every day.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who Pokémon Go does not play - it only sees the raw data to enhance performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to be active" "" "from the sofa," "" "to be active every day, because many public messages are boring and come true by people who look at the elend." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Therefore, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt for even new friends.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also Moravian game corrupted who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has taken a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit could already follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help so many people on the hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I present to me under the women's olympic presence and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been in the Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turbines, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie "Hernandez, which inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the catholic in is, complete, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has paved the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female turnerers was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas seen a surprising Olympics in America and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they expected unexpected, yet masterly Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-battle event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so the classes in the whole country do not look out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "final Five" because the next Olympics are only four turnerers in the crew. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that turbulence is a dearer sport and turbines are maintained primarily in private turnaround which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furniture, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turner and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner get her entire training and this is a teens and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, instructor of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes, since they started practicing.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, make a performance and easier access turnout.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">During my events, we have provided free and affordable turings in Harlem for over 15,000 people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide youth high-quality turbines, which earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turkey develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care about Turning and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team golds and thanks, Fass her so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from her property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">Once they were raped from their estate, the condominium co-administrated shareholders have found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who actually buy records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to the commentary, to sow him under the alias non-samlection of men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov the diverse revival of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials that would like to greet the news of physical objects but to a mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are of any foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror by Hobbycollectors - it has an emotional importance: older record purchaser retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, would follow me to follow the camera while I walk in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble servant and wildly, before I stand for rest, my hands and some sort of determining how: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart Sohos gets slowly down to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) to the Recess Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, question I?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already reckon," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed) to dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy records which he could not afford to buy records when they appeared and re-buy items that he sold, when he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying the boards, rather introverted and likes to spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works by Sister Ray, believes that many customers, which he meets to apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback and led to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have managed, people usually have been bottled up to 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the records of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of confidential sound-slitter, of objects, the happy Jugenderclings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "cogs a staff of a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a turntable, whom they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blows through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy."</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came only recently here and said," "" "I don't have a turntable but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put it into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-laserless, less musiklash.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no turntable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly coming.</seg>
<seg id="44">Stop that has devoted the sound plates to almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beasts new synthesizer- and sexpacker pop instead of experimental jazz, from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks quite lonely, but wet mental traumas are difficult, if one stands for next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for several minutes and looks at the varietsown of the records.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a mannequin than a large screen saver.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not deserve much, so the collecting of boards is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It will cost a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers is to be inspired: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression the jeans hotspots, I observe a group of young teenagers, grouped up for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above, that it is impossible to touch her.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one who has many luxuries like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record business in Soho, the great number of female collector who exist in reality, record stores and in online research, unconsidered.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not by strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and leaves by plates, while they steer the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, who protrudes over the shoulders nothing of the middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby arrived at the finals on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when faced with a result of 43-7 at the defensive stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stepping, pressing, line-run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympiamin line of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was sweeten by the not too bad weather price of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they swallow New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji on this form would have been a 15-man team in its form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a solace for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it was lost under Ryan of every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop is going to do, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started and caused the attacks to GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to above, than Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes of game, Jerry Tuwai still got another attack from the right-hand corner that he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly hole the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hot baptismal Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it has just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-pfiff and there was still over a minute game time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's so as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half times by and closed the fijianic gap... for quite four minutes, what was good for the circumstances of the first half-time, until Joshua Tuisova ran after a brilliant balance of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran for a long time in favor of southern overseas, whose fans sals, flags and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pfiff, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicking crushing into the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji had been defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa in a scarce half-final match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton disrupted the line with impressive footwork and recorded a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant condemnation of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-hour team, won the prize - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than with those games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hits, which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they subsequently breached the second Olympiad in two without a tax in succession, for the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all its 39.ter impaired use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins who glide across the surface with the elegance of sponges, which is not reflected in the type of triumphant.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in ruin, a battalion are contributing to wilful helpers which make up the difference and it was no man assistant than the coach, which was not known 30 months ago, whether he would survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bmp-cancer, which is operable and that they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a fairly bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which had kept the interruption to a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the imminence of victory, their first thought of Williams, who spent a nerve-up morning in order to talk a little more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was the captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was a emotional wreck this week. this may be something extremely, but it doesn't mean so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeated how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, studying music, she triumphed the compartment, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>

<seg id="4">After a sample they feel balanced, merry and a total of living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">She is doing something good at the same time with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is a great hobby for seniors in several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler by the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people's joy in music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular interaction you can establish social contacts and cultivate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures develop in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made URSEL Kipp in their choir:" "" "arrange to arrange and organize themselves on the other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this is exercising a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly calls his lungs regularly, is not so fast in everyday life and not as fast as the puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to preserve the sound of the voice at age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">To older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal community of the senior organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In older generations, the united Singen had a much higher place, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Tend to be observed often that the singing or hearing of songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through liedlyrics and special melodies, itself denied people in long reclaimed events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head will also be asked for a special achievement, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone, practice not just focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: when I take long for something, I become better and watchful about me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing is so enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says to have little talent, betrays Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 declines people, who sounds there when a sound goes off?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer Seniors has various possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sings someone from the acquaintances in a senior fennel, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can apply directly to the church or church officials.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior citizens can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the internet may ask the family, friends or neighbours around the Internetreach ck.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone wanting to sing, should necessarily join a choir that Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul good and has something wrong - this is true of any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this Filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unsensitizing against breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Absurde.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a piece of Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are disflowering, especial tools that generate more than 30 million euros per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the failures to the public are to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have criticised the past criticism in which they were accused of using the app Blackface formal or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week several users proposed a filter that gave them sledding, false teeth and diseness cheeks, there were some critics of a racist caricature of Asian - "yellowing."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if this controversy surpassed on a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the revolt were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and Motherboard, one day after snapchat, that it would have disabled the feature disabled.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as homage to Anime-characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtodischees.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean American student, whose tweet was widely used by the photos that the filter was "vulnerable and eased unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the counterposition of a very conflicting Asian caricature and the filtering effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellowing was pulled to the extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless divergence and integration of integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people who are committed to race as their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats Filters generates an image that is abusive for a user, "so it is much harder to remain unnoticed when it was earlier the case," said the 25-year Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium to clear her snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that they believe that rackable controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the interfering with Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the large part white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no various representation of people with other skin colour in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other colored colors that work there, but do not feel at positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint, the Snapchat, mostly unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, there was Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his associates but according to a consultation, the company recently focused on a personnel responsible, focused on subordinate population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu said in turn that she is closed her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military installations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services typically abstained from high-level CentCom Commandeuren typically, signed a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual states on site and were thoroughly investigated as analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican Member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The managers at CentCom are ranging from to the top priority of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-sided report shows detailed continuous problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their supervisors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or Isil.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half-year 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom also announced that a military reconquest of Mozambique could begin already in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much clearly." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress (s) from Kansas, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the tops of Central Command changed the thoughtful reports to run the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force in life, after which we have played, analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed through detailed knowledge during the investigations.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports are underway by the German Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, following some of the conclusions adopted by Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an overly restricted process for creating replacements to Isil and the Iraqi security services," the highest democrat in coma, member in the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion known.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, as Mr. ship," "" "delayed the publication of reportedly reports," "" "said Morals among analysts and" "" "had less space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. ship and Democrats" "" "Democrats" "" "had no evidence of an intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts in terms of" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday through" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">In August the New York Times reported by an investigation by the inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded according to complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press secretary of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the general inspector were still underway." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite diverting opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Defense Department welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "investigators have beyond the question of a successful aviation campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence)." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year, however, have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honoring military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the enactate information about the Islamic State remind us of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw the recommendations of many analysts just a little crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to provide claims by government agencies, that contrary to the statements of the government of air pollution, did not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This realization however was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms daman Command-holders, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of its overly positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans will banish with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, it knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which one of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed won a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game will go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host, four years after they landed over the past London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleger in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a member of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the kayak.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham became an Englishman, a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working time in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the helm completely on it.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gate in the first half of the game with a backhand out of the Middle-range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was at stake in the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed herself surprising and kept the play of 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and lute the ball into the gate for the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the pkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who have previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is also, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inescapable of gaining a rapid season between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic fenacket itself would be a burning down, which is handed over from the wristband to swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour on the queue in the Coffeeshop without over Simone Biles, Katie Leliy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's swarm with griners, could have been sent by these known names that would have been sent to Prime Time, created by sponsors and well-being-advertisements when he would be a swimmers, turner or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: airbrush-shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may have reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should do modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it was noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked, did not know that there is an Olympias at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even though the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline, and until 2012 there had been an athlete who has made it up to the final dogs.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outdoor charms, partly because it sounds suitable for an enlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an indispensable enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end clouds - but also the Grazie of the gymnasium and diving, the two sports that unites it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shooting almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, heave and saltos) before they end up on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are evaluated according to official Olympians for execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-four athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward, and drabove, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only chase the scellline or the output wall, but in the television transfer also another height-height goal: the one of the world or the Olympiad ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think about when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-moving movement is not the destination.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she pralluated, apparently weightlessness as an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortless again upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wault in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant ulceramination of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the Endrunden as part of an afternoon-bloc of 2 days from 14: 00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one, which is likely to be overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be obtained through the ogling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner would have recently proposed - then Mr Dooley awaits his following air rinse, new fanclub.</seg>

<seg id="3">Demonstrators to demand political changes in Ethiopia, shout against violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in shame.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the last ten years there was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months protests against the government have shook themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses cast that policemen were shot and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the re-run video about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, are showing how safety people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handbag against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Agency for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in future it will be even harder," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get as much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new pendant train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereusidents were finally silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven to the waging of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and these do not have any other options except protesting it, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethics.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth was protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom-up to the stranglehold in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a broad election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now they control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tension along the border into Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line called for June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are afraid that separatists have been imposed over the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less forced over the past few years, using turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of indignation after years of moving ahead are now exploded.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years have been very many Ethiopians able to communicate with the social media because cheap smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate via Internet-proxies that conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they assembled themselves to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, mainly Christian High-countries, in politics and economics, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims live and live in flat-areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But also this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that constitute around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, in trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was up to his death on a non-contracted illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly engaged in using early signs of discontent and to use special officers to process opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lack it in this basic skill," Mr Abdi, "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen by relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "" "" "unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopian, Mr Haitian maritime comes from the south." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time they experienced such a rebellion was 2005, after thousands of elections were protested, according to indications of analytical seems to have been defuelled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following razors, many protesters were killed, even though it were less than in recent months, and this time of unrest went relatively fast.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopa lobal Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure, like the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">The last month protests of the gonfly in Gondar, a shamanic city, led by Tigray, and hatred towards the Tigray is always more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests in the USA and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American administration used Ethiopia as a base for Dronym for the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently announced that she has closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to allay the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign, by attacking his repeatedly reiterated allegation, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarifying statement creates new questions concerning the communication skills of the Republican candidate for republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and understand the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his collaborators, who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain the peculiar position, statements that he might not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump was back with respect to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn't intended to mention the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr Trump wanted to help to mitigate the statement by trying him to destroy him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, wanted to know the republican presidential system.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticism screened to Mr. Trump while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of the response of its response.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinically would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to its defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he was a strong criticism of himself when he said, the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clint Emails, but later he said "Of course I mean the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then re-establish when needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages can be taken by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary," clarify "according to how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist in the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I believe it is cleverly enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of taking the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an add-up note, as its diverging values continue to go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a tour with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general seeks to apologise for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while it reinforces the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherzs have brought his loyal fellow streetinto the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him no matter how provocative his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani so he was interviewed for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in that sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-singers, completely wrong and therefore it came to pass, because he moved the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream publicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an external Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them up on each of his words and be taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he cavities the" "" "poor" "" "television experts who tried to understand and said," "" "You Can't miss it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mock about Mr. Trumps apology as only one more proof that he is unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacy of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland waterschildrodle soups.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on this day was a bit modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato-puree and as dessert a stimenpudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historikers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" treated by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Ziegelman told her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your latest cooperation, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They demonstrated culinary solidarity, when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snacking-free Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock crash 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh food wich with olive trees, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato pree and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered minstrates, this found the couple for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peolut bread, liver cheese and savory bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and slightly cheaper which has the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have placed himself in the stomach and lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women boiled for male rock work and it was served freshly baked Pastete for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who were starving food on starving Europeans during the first World War." "" "A Square" "", "sets the paths with which the country turned out to be no more the Schedaffenland." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central, tense issue," "" "beggar Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new budget of budgetown: mysterious food like loaves and cold cuts were found to staple food, the Kasserolle as a "wonderful way, vinegar remains," merging Ziegelman to hide from the cooks of unappetizing ingredients with a creative sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying tables.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became one of the fourth luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures have been tried, because a calorie-rich and nourishing satisfaction had precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from that epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition on lunch," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "Ziegelman continues to perform:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the farm recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budgetary economic development - including Louise Stanley, leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923-1943 - the eating behaviour of the country is so good.</seg>
<seg id="33">By reassuring the articles and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become a "household policy" and the challenge, pampas, as creamy spaghetti with carrots to transform into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square meal" "" "is a celebration of historical delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me-cakes-eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he made public the simple Iowa farm's cuisine with his kitchen, speiste he has become like the millions of millions of world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental kitchen like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded menu and carried out a smoking.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a glorious realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt could have committed the same error if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to reconstruct his stomach with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the accused of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforted meals. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, with food, was rejected, once the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacies is on our continued focus on calories and food, "said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave to better understood the eating habits of Ziegelmans-in-law - for example they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "Ziegelman recalled:" "" "she actually made people sick." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the case of windsurfing.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the dishes were evacuated at Eisenberg's, they moved and coe a dessert, which they had dressed at home: the plastray, the president Roosevelt did eat.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vortex is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come only in winter to finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna-Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland won't get up with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely swims the Greenland shark at the bottom of the North Atlantic coast, in an hour it comes on average at 220 feet far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This characteristic of long-term lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate of a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span which means a world record for cyclamen.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist had long been that Greenland can be stony stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface in winter only.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know how little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pentago measure she, as she saw before Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw-bones of a young ice-bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly you chase them sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-eres and seek carcasses, which are from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland haie that lived from Greenland or Svalbard as a cheque from the depth of the North Atlantic Ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">To ascertain the age of animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens already occurs before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be redone later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the liners.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear-weapon-attempt larger amounts of this radioactive carbon atoms to the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest beast the liners contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland haie in their liners had normal carbon-14 quantities, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 cm long Greenland, an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland, however, received offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to assign the length to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably due to the threshold of the sex mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland deals with the multiplication obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this might be the most likely world chord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme living above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old harpoon lace, was captured before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism living there are living in asflare.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal bucks heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on as much as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in Timlupe: a 20 years ago, the Nokia communicator came on the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successor to dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite klosty.</seg>

<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came just 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, to the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few Euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the InterNet Age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product for a few months previously at the CeBIT in Hanover as "office in the west-format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could send a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax was communicator to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by HTML-browser, albeit agonizing slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital addressbook and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could have imagined in August of 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell-saving of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and executed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today dominate suppliers that came all much later than Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once more habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resembled those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have been dipped in similar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slowing rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have a thin, erted-like atmosphere and yet slowly revolved.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit up the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet was probably disliked more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to lodge life and protect them from quicker.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus profiled also from a sun that was 30 per cent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slowing rotation of Venus is almost two months long," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the sun heating.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, some degree of cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles its evolution that was previously suspected by Planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although she was once more habitable, Venus -- has been exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans hid and her water vapor was burned down by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydroxion turned only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect back -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars in the starstar cluster can rotate at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods with the planet Earth.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other stargates, read more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-christening of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star-pile, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach the adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">In peak rates these poignant stars encounter big amounts of starch currents.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a brewing effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">If a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to decelerate.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable starch - like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates shows that a more intense stars turn slower than a less massive star.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with a larger star slow pirouettes to rotate as smaller.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow Rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star-christening of the pleads is so close, it serves as an idealistic laboratory to compare stellar qualities as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star-christening of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, When, When and why stars try to slow down their rotation rates, and so to speak their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="8">The International Sportgerichtshof CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time excluding the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds, she missed the bronze.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen would have to participate in the foothills of over 50 m Freestl.</seg>

<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the corpse." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is intended to act on the forbidden substance for the EPO.</seg>

<seg id="21">Thus, approximately every weight of weight may not be part of the chronically-stressful nation in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known as the London Olympians in class to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days previously positive to the anole steroid Nandrolon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datasheets: so perfide presses your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of obtaining malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes amongst 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies were at least once, partly repeatedly victim to an attack with blacksmith software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, just 20 percent of companies have already been the goal of a ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid to the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialized in compressing their blacksmith software according to the observations of Malwarebytes with an impact on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially saving ransom is much higher than in private use.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of harm software," "" "explains Malwarebytes-CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators are discovered for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "first, private use was the target, but the transition to company attacs was frightening over the past few months." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim active, they look for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of cryptowing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private use the personal photo database is at stake, there are companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off, if a ransomware is attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German firms affected resulting sales loss by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt the business, in one case people were in life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, given a stalemate in the operation the claim to reject the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try to establish a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers of F-Secure the utility surfaces and contact with the prespressions are examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They declare their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, freely accessible support websites or encode for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will be able to redeem private persons after payments of a few hundredth euros, businesses must have some tough negotiation and five digits to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware coverage, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains security professionals Chester-niewski of the Antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, however, is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building on the actual blacksmith.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware themselves, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars were purchased.</seg>
<seg id="31">"this package includes a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be altered," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The prescriptions are then looking for further hackers in order to distribute the freshly made software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, you log in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal, and commissioned another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per each calculated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals do become clamp with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of the companies should be able to trust in the Malwarebytes survey, to repel the ransomware via file back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful creation, the perpetrators are instead known with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes manager Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential, depending on the type of data still a lot higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they could get a thermostat under their control over the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "in the middle of winter the activist of a so-called heating so many victims could certainly be a ransom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a production road in a factory, Ransomware might also be a topic in industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, you are eternally awake, at night you are awake for hours in the morning, the morning is far off to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep dormitories and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeves, and there are many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter We's, Board member of the German Society for sleeping research and sleeping medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you see, however, is the insomnia, so a inhalation and sleepy disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that can sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, Board member at the German HausMedical Association with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can organic, mental or mental factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder in a different condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is often common in depression," "" "says Wemit." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors do one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a band trap, can be bad, watching every two or three hours and perhaps he begins to greet you about everyday problems and -worry, there are trams an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who will not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor, betrays way.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is tired, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical ailments like stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, amongst other things, behaviour change, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medication - classic sleeping-coated tablets are only used in exceptional and most suitable for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any sleep in Germany in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedtime, one should contact at bedtime problems at the primary care physician, betrays white.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can resolve by studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For instance, to examine in the sleep laboratory medical examinations, for example with snoring with respiratory tract, in sleeping-fatigue, at sleek-fatigue, or if you do not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">Actually you do not have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After cabling, one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Beside the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose rille, a chest strap and a glowing on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can anyone get the problems get a grip?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many positions on which one can put for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White-molded counts: regular sleeping-ups and rise, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the night, do not watch TV to sleep, alcohol, and at night did not look at the clock - then you start to be reckoned immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lenses, meanwhile have a remainder of cobblestones: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain works at first sight, but the police count them among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Along the road from east to west, one gets along the slots, a frescoed kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the facade of a gray house someone "ugly!"</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite from a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rentals.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy district" as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, in the last weeks, however, preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile, the residents of the rental agreements, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the beginning of the year, Henkel in the beginning of the year, Henkel had argued for a hard-hard approach to the police against the project, the area called "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, which were given by Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, and three weeks reported official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, sperched parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile its renovated construction workers on behalf of the infamous homeowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and builders on the rejoicing of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents go walking with children, sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about walkti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a basic school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who are here three children, are mainly directed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house-projects they share the care of rising tenants and fervation.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a jaw that multiply police-protection against vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior and the police between domestic workers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshafts in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional worker-district, which also today in comparison with the rest of the city has a lower average age and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home occupied and the resulting housing projects are long for Kiev: 1990, numerous homes were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the whole Main Street, very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under great police court in a downright road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: the inhabitants of the GDR, former times, and former household occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them in the slices, or freshly coated facade, which were kicked with color.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours can see that as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes, as a body-breaking, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make Sachsences, which tend more to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a flat house next to the controversial 94 years, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as for violence, it is more important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, that were not intended." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous flammers cars put it right in the Rigaer for longer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is no criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more each other with, than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also important to her that the inhabitants got their road back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation above the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants such as Neugebauer the road continues to take away: through secured new buildings in former buildings, which throng the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately property flats, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good," she says.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not bear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if one never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">It focuses on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the occupants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those drawn over colour-bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene were among the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub that can be bad about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked to be called by their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is a social worker-worker.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, the labor of refugees, administration, public authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilchsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less ridiculously stranded as rather on the variety of desire tasks purposeful - as the management wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long standing experience in the field of social work, just a viable Wollmichsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on three years of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuschle ehrer and full-time actors support." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been to be found for quite some time, apartments for the connecting juncture, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connection, the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landscape, at the Commune and at the jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every host wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration is no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not exist until now, be reliant on private apartments, so Deuterle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be visited as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika Deuschle agreed.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a fixed base, there are interns, educational places, school fields, one-euro jobs and tutoring for refugees and migrants that need to be undocated or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work at the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, however, does not work only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a lack of feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially learning courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees got the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and allows them to overbridge the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually create the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, who will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">There are also troubleshooting, however, says customers honestly, "people, where nothing goes." the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All that is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two most recent incidents fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine client says quite clearly, "what managna may call naïve," a residual risk and wants to shut them out.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks they release them completely in revocation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers need to be on the spot and in the region following activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new pile of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly to answer, shy the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to provide them helpers on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already planning to integrate the present people up to the present time.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">However, if people are in need, they should help them both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
