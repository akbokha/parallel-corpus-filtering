Obama receiving Benjamin Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to destabili@@ ze the international agreement and to Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing actions in the Middle East .
but when it comes to meeting the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution , it is also discussed .
for many years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been stretched .
Washington critici@@ zed the continuing settlement @-@ making of Israel and casts a faul@@ ted will in the peace process .
through the agreement expressed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu had a cont@@ entious issue at the invitation of re@@ public@@ ans in front of the American Congress , which has been partly in an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this by pointing at the time im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel .
in an emergency , Professor , his girlfriend have shot up
in a staff , Professor Sh@@ annon &apos;s son talked with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ est voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surrender it was important to acc@@ entu@@ ate that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house found the officials of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand@@ written note stating on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , moved , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot a door to his office and killed him .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that after the dre@@ am@@ ful emergency number one eventually made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police kes@@ hi@@ ked him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and faculty to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees , who knew him , helped create an image of a talented , but maybe difficult teachers to draw .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre @-@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both under@@ judged in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members were 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there have been some incl@@ ination about problem behavior patterns .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , he also seemed a little upset and nervous , &quot; as if something had been wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , told him that lamb was told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
light had previously requested the Delta State University for a carriage of health reasons , saying that he had any medical problem either .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University signi@@ fied that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to work as an assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he has nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that we can no longer answer .
after the flight from campus the police found Lam@@ bs track when he moved into Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he could be arrested , killed herself along with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber Pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his Par@@ king on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , he started his work at the University , which has 3.@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he took his doc@@ torate in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs characterized him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends .
they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach you the guitar game .
he was then the women &apos;s flock .
all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson H@@ stadt of Bran@@ don inhab@@ itable .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to one Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , told they were over 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally wre@@ cked off the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he was never met today , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that I was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had both appeared in a summer year three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writing and sing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked for several companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes a entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le &apos;s Room , a weak lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Eve and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of September 5th for the last time after I finished his bass and harmon@@ ic@@ uous audience before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the morning and we felt together .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the first professor , led the semester seminar seminar programme and specialized in American Native Hawai@@ ians and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and students .
on the Delta State University in Cleveland participated in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including faculty , staff , students and members of the community in a cand@@ l@@ elight appointment .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the Mah@@ n@@ wake , while the Universal Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing Grace , &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that after he shot the not@@ ary , after he was shot by Schmidt and that lamb recorded in his not@@ ary p@@ enti@@ ce as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox : his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a professional moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty , and it is slowly clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it appears in my mind that I am a simul@@ ated G@@ m@@ b and an ar@@ mes@@ length of it , with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time &quot; , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Leah Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as Director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .

UN Chief says : there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that almost five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN CEO again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support Integr@@ ative negotiations on the Fin@@ der of a political solution .
on Wednesday , B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the Assembly &apos;s meeting to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ores the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and of the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to address the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving nuclear De@@ als with Iran .
8 surround en@@ closures that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taking seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for an collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys down@@ ward , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate gul@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that during that time in 2011 , Rick &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , of which no one had even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ side groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC , and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s through@@ s and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s expos@@ ing levels have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced its can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in early August , there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
these figures remain in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has realized last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good idea of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
just two out of 10 they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he were the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son provides about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who would like to say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; would be if J@@ ephone Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans see truste@@ e temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of those voters in the Re@@ public@@ ans believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pro@@ secutor of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to execute his work effectively , and almost six out of 10 Independent may say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
re@@ public@@ s can get used to the idea .
when they put their nests , can hold Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp for real .
if you are asked who won the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , tell one survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week , four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time , when four out of ten ended its money in Cal@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est Crystal Ball in the past .
at this stage in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards only 28 % for the final candidate . Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters will look at Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ si@@ bly .
even if the Republi@@ can raised itself by another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still taking almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itting field would probably contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s management while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is based on more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has harv@@ ested the majority support .
he has before C@@ early Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey done by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the Tru@@ mp for giving their votes out .
of course , a lot can happen to change it , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp in immigration .
since then , Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign launched two months ago from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; was the immigration and fishing hub in the public discourse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp are crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and the re@@ oriented efforts will be damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but according to the new ABC / post pol@@ l issued by Monday 6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration in the lim@@ elight remains , it will appear with Donald Tru@@ mp apparently .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son deals with the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than have someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks shows that three of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive accomodation units in Germany
here is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street it costs a square meter of a th@@ et@@ roof in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers are the most cost @-@ meter most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s Top @-@ residential locations , one of the prize will occur as the pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service provider &amp; Völk@@ l has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square footage in wind@@ di@@ ble heights .
that one has several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
double Tor@@ cher in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happy match by Thomas Müller paved the way to making FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sovereign el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario I@@ tz@@ e have won the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their launch in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ tz@@ es results ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth generation success in Serie will be the first step towards the Fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the head@@ line to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28th issue in the Champions League of the Champions League for the defense of the Olympi@@ ad of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world &apos;s grand@@ daughter .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; had promised Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game at the Kara@@ is@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Mün@@ chner stopped word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea , without it to shine .
Piraeus had gained his recent six home@@ games in the top class , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also proud here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , wanted not to be the next victim .
they were brave , with their aggressive efforts , but often to come out of work .
the attacks were often developed by play@@ back on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , which rarely had happened against the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ ks off the right @-@ point in the upper left corner on the left corner .
at the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown the head of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct rep@@ ay@@ ment , the Tor@@ ah Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
although Bavaria was habit@@ u@@ ated in the sham@@ ans game , Piraeus could put N@@ adel@@ ou@@ che .
on Tor@@ ro@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er however was the entrance .
so for about , as he drew a shot of ide@@ ye by the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola took a four @-@ party with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario I@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WC @-@ hero gave the green light only after the final training , said Sport@@ al@@ ee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he did King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the stran@@ ded Lev@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clear , by El@@ f@@ meters , Müller still took a dr@@ one .
before the game there was in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of partly squ@@ ander@@ ed Bavaria fans in their viewer @-@ block seems to provoke the followers of the hosts pir@@ ated with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact on the Mün@@ chner supporters .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who is smo@@ kes , so that not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : if the risk is decl@@ ining the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Studies ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking , the risk of losing their teeth was pre@@ matur@@ ely in order to decrease the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had watched over 23@@ 300 participants .
major causes for tooth failure are tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth decay , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ sizing the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
not clarified whether smoking increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who heard the smoking with smoking , could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it can take over ten years to the haz@@ ard again to the level of non @-@ smoking , the dust @-@ established Thomas Diet@@ rich explained at the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one should persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smoking , explained trial manager H@@ a Boeing discovered by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and containers and also leads to our findings to a good dental health down to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population affected by 65 to 74 years of dental sur@@ pl@@ essness shared by DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early f@@ low@@ out rates .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ mines the findings .

European Commission propos@@ ing a new trial in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to raise the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transpar@@ ent@@ less system which corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trusted citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström stated in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish din , proposes the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP vs The largest free trade area in the world will arise with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings cont@@ ours in particular that the EU @-@ states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
they are meant to come to identical parts of the EU , the US and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to lift up against jud@@ g@@ ments .
hitherto the procedures involved in the arbitr@@ ator , an objection against their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion last months , I have become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an International Investment Court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified .
the investor @-@ state arbitration cases , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel control over the companies claims to cover tax@@ payers , national laws , or reducing consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements ( Anti @-@ TTIP ) organizations such as Camp@@ act , the Commission &apos;s proposals are insufficient .
the assessment was also critici@@ zed especially that they are not to apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) spoke on the other hand as great progress .
the Commission considered the reform essential points , the Federal Minister of Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring worked with other EU Trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitration cases was of the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European corporation of B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned that the pi@@ anos of the economy should limit the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be disadvantaged by it .
when the talks about the TTIP free trade agreement ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) has been completed on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US as yet .
originally a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is regarded as no longer viable .
off@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy red Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with fil@@ es@@ sti@@ ff .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by Stev@@ ens lecture .
he talks about various places he always records on the map and report his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they came into existence and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , Mr. Stev@@ ens proves himself as a wonderful creative mani@@ ac .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear cle@@ ated songs that can be harmonious at the very close to American Folk of the late 1960s , but at any time in the right @-@ wing extravag@@ ant drift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ru@@ mor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a tw@@ isted series : each of the 50 U.S. federal states should be rec@@ alled in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks up positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chicago &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ le@@ iss &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears in 2005 an extensive masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ ord@@ ingly in ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American bili@@ board charts and is not missing in a yearly @-@ listing of influential music media .
for extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens applied to &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) extensively with extensive electronic pieces .
this sixth studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , yet taken from programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are shown here for the colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead and large fluor@@ es@@ cing top marks .

&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and one can basically throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ bi@@ ns inau@@ g@@ ural session of the Prime Minister
since its election Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns is expected to meet the prime minister of Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour president Jeremy Cor@@ bi@@ n is supposed to give his debut on the Prime Minister for the Prime Minister and to create himself with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n will rise to noon for the first of his six @-@ time issues , while his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from the proximity .
he asked for &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could have ski@@ pped some sessions to leave his colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns , because after his appointment they became a member of the Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ et@@ ts and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ote has prov@@ oked at a memorial service for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , at the centre of several title @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Decision , not to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ote , has drawn attention to itself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said he was &quot; in dis@@ respectful silence &quot; and he had recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , talked about the BBC Two News@@ night program , he did get the Labour Party to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ote , &quot; independently , &quot; by his faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns leaders , and they were called to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the parliament@@ arians were originally supported as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences will also be st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour Party and by Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limit of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour wants to take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister , that the party &quot; was &quot; very clear &quot; to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ at 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , who has since David Cameron , since he has been the T@@ ory boss in the last decade , over the Disp@@ atch Box in the parliament .
the Labour president , who promised a different policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister is to confront the Prime Minister , and he is leaving the threat of resistance and to tackle the dispute with resistance and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said that Angela eagle , the shadow of economics will be represented in him , if he is not participating - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also got the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he was John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub@@ house , I addressed to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron spoke that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who is often linked with the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he concluded that he failed in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the fra@@ gment with the Prime Minister was considered an important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics argue that she became a caric@@ ature and had far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose un@@ wi@@ ped according to data , which showed a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was recorded 100 by the D@@ BM@@ iller an objective .
between May and July the result was increased without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest ever since 2009 and was estimated at the time of a rate of interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was cr@@ amped up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a leap from 20 % after the take @-@ offer of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Bur@@ gers shares were encouraging in encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ists 0,@@ 9 % higher .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts brand recent sales numbers hit all expectations and showed also that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth .
shares of Glen@@ core came by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , although with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his estimate for the company R@@ ating to sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sports@@ wear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will be the higher labour costs at his company , says he .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings san@@ itation by the potato @-@ like idea
potatoes or don@@ er ?
they are both - and that during the Kartoff@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , who has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Cock@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; from D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ hay has car@@ tru@@ ffle and meat combined to a sp@@ ar .
the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television .
since then in his shop a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea adopted by the Government of the Government at the Patent Office in Munich .
there , according to the Authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ it contains , Al@@ hay therefore does not want to reveal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes really better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with his customers the culinary principles come well .
Met@@ cash launches bottom @-@ level campaign to combat ageing .
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ adata has started to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di have prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops rehear@@ s@@ als and shop owners , who withdraw tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will provide further details from his defense strategy on the 29th of September when the wholes@@ al@@ ers worked for food , alcohol and devices to its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; business day .
there is much stake in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ loads and higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared with around 14 per cent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of its first markets , some five percent of the food market will be cut off in these two states and will take away all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
a report published this week according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million sales revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will be losing $ by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate annual sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and with the amounts on met@@ a @-@ high fix@@ ture could cost met@@ cash approximately 13 million US profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan was found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s revenues in food and food business rose by 3.8 percent in 2016 to reduce 4.2 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 per cent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has added contact .
from 2010 onwards , IG@@ As Market share dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food outlets , which has about 1,@@ 200 percent since 2012 has decreased by 43 percent , reflecting the operating reduction of debt reduction while maintaining sales and margins .
the big wholes@@ al@@ ers dri@@ lls and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ s@@ ths to produce hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A retailers can supply to improve their shops thanks to rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private @-@ label products .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and charging stations to give to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to profit growth .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves praise as a criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ o Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; Col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as a criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ te@@ akis , the younger brother &apos;s talented Du@@ os , is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous debate of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying session in Cincinnati as soon as Kok@@ te@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison will need to be separated by the arbitr@@ ator , stating : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to propose Kyr@@ gios , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how to sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ quet , after a cr@@ amp had a potential US Open @-@ win of Richard Gaz@@ ette , Kok@@ te@@ akis was ste@@ ad@@ fast defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in 2nd place in single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I rather devote myself up , is the fact that after my view than@@ asi a little was caught up into the dispute , He@@ aly said .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ ate good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was dealt with a little too high .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the locker room , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account at the important decision @-@ decision , which begins on Friday , and it describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but it secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not on all the controversi@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has done very quickly for what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray had pointed out , but we tried to support him , but we try to get him out of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares Emer@@ gency shelter , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declares the emergency and bol@@ ted the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants were killed in a no @-@ man &apos;s land and Serbian government with indign@@ ation .
the people who were f@@ lown out before violence were camp@@ ed for an un@@ familiar time in a coastal strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
however , fruit@@ less rose to .
as a police helicopter above them web@@ fed , s@@ wor@@ ded the migrants &quot; openings the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against Hungarian marketing policy .
some were taken from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece will arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a rod harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks in Brussels and other countries over the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turmoil on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block in Brussels no common immigration policy was agreed upon at a deb@@ atable meeting in Brussels .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who searched out in the bri@@ dged Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not stand up with his hopes for an early event of Brussels or from its neighbours .
the public offices held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more power to cope with the crisis so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races have been imposed on the competition , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant margin from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East as a significant hard@@ pass and to the entry point into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most economic migrants are in search of a better life and not refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contradic@@ tory to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary do the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence , which left the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for condemned merchants .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs already in days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban said that authorities spend 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come from before they damage the fence , they are now in police officers , and will be accused of disp@@ ens@@ ation of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are here to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train ra@@ gon was bar@@ ed with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the major border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to work on the data of people and thrust a crowd to penetrate into .
approximately 20 managed to come in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connections between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .

Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders stood second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet proclaimed whether he is responsible for the Presidential Administration , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before beginning elections , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion stands or what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ically supporters are more durable in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ BS scored several profits .
Clinton holds a great head of women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced itself .
their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage with democratic voters in 50 has been de@@ ple@@ xed , and they are on the same height from now on .
Clinton had a big head start with the older voters .
last month , Clinton had been against a two @-@ point lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections say enough that Clinton would support us with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the Party .
one fourth would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only assist them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are stronger , with those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would they be enthusiastic .
while 48 per cent of democratic voters say they say Clinton with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say so through their peak edge @-@ data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ t supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman chairman is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
at Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) will also be mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and voters are also cited .
as the Vice President asks for the President of the Office for the presidential elections , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race , although one third believed that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den at the helm .
from Clin@@ t &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of us .
decide to susp@@ end Bi@@ den , not for the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s edge is increasing in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with bees in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has declined from 78 per cent in the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that he sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important when a candidate is more important , Democratic voters call themselves questions about voters .
similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these voters of the election will be unacceptable as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates show good results with some important features in elec@@ tors in the election of their party .
there are maj@@ orities , Clinton , S@@ anders and be@@ k as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership features .
Bi@@ den cuts down at the three candidates best in honesty , whilst Clin@@ ically &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
democratic voters of the elections usually see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bal@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions to Hill@@ ary Clinton must continue using a personal email address and a server during the term of office as a foreign minister , most Democratic voters are pleased with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions are not influenced in total .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is content .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem of light arrived .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated .
these are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , who say their views from Clinton had become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy it is still a problem for them among registered elec@@ tors . only 32 percent do they see as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trustworthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of the elec@@ torate in the world ranks are also tru@@ mp as not honest and cannot be trusted .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are given good banknotes in leadership .
of the six tested candidates make Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honesty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have any opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is on a nationwide survey , close to Donald Tru@@ mp .
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates have now deterior@@ ated half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others will decline dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide in a large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted in front of the Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the survey held on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son weigh in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and Tru@@ mp is made under republi@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ early Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ sich , who died at the deepest Scott Walker , who is at deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third place .
the debu@@ gger at the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - he lands with 19 % assistance with the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey done by ABC News / Washington Post was also shown in Tru@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some side@@ dness for the former neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s surgery , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the last Saturday while a show of campaigns in Iowa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bath@@ tu@@ bers there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find a warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some are no longer going into the sea : max . 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic sea during this week , shares the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
in the other hand , bathing temperatures continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a pan @-@ like ritual at Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , will be submitted against five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch college P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i ho@@ ists attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory meeting in September 2013 and hes@@ it@@ ant his transport to the hospital , leading to his death divided the police .
officials spoke that he had been charged with associated eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on one goal .
Mr. Den@@ g ultimately said about head@@ ache , then he fell apart .
the members of the P@@ i Delta PSI bro@@ therhood did not spro@@ ut the emergency number 911 , after being powerless and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to switch from dress to clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , President Mar@@ sig@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood , basically about what was said about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said B@@ anks , Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ tic report , Den@@ g was repeated with st@@ ump@@ tion power injuries to head , torso and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ ps of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ra@@ ils , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ S family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable and this step from public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charges for murder of the third gra@@ der for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with interference and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - this has sanc@@ tioned so we will also hold this to account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a capital increase will come , and the house@@ holders will fall in charge , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will be dra@@ gging in a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the story for the economy has only a small instruction to follow .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve with raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather over the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could realize that the entire excitement was eventually exaggerated because of a zinc increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Julian Jes@@ en@@ p , Che@@ k@@ co at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends - looking at how some areas of the economy might react :
as seen in the market last month , the for@@ er@@ ation of zinc increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase in the increase , the influence is not that dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be explored from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after a interest rate of F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is generally up@@ lifting in recent 35 years - about 14 per cent - on its way to a zinc increase , fairly flat in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , Bob D@@ oll , head system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the sin@@ king cycle , and the return on return begins to l@@ essen .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic life , but interest rates are raising them often .
in the current case , F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could speed up a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product will be close to its lowest point at a zinc increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect to be only 1.5 percent in the third quarter from Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such an fragile economic environment could be risky and ask the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have agreed on a global increase of F@@ ed , and all eyes were set at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC might have completed an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading could only be a 25 percent probability .
&quot; in our study all the increases cycles of 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and on rec@@ essions very quickly put after the start of recovery in the shadow , &quot; says the report .
contrary to this , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the watched phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed had been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months now .
the firm income was also volati@@ le since the market is increasing capital increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than shares , when changing its strategic course .
at bonds the ren@@ ders appear to be changed once the first increase / reduction in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the expansion cycle , the bond problems dropped immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates may lead to cr@@ ashes between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
high @-@ performance bonds often bring better income in such a climate although , &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ sing at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , says Jones , that markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the income tax is fl@@ atter , mark@@ ups has increased and volati@@ lity - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large and whole undertaking , companies that benefit the larger share of their operations in the United States will benefit , if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are being inf@@ erior , as a rising dollar is making its products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react highly positively three months after initial interest increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with increased balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
company with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also imp@@ lied their counterparts of lower quality by average ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexi@@ bla@@ ze interest are to be lost most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of pure stock , consumers will also benefit by increasing dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could see profits through higher yields , even though experts are different opinions how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Commander @-@ member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards and told that she has just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle the broadcast The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; into Classic FM , maintains a leader member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something what the private station does not do .
the conservative members Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender was &quot; dum@@ me &quot; and increasingly don &apos;t be distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which began in the last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under a different name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously @-@ mentioned examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General showed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competition when it comes to live music and learning .
what I &apos;m going to learn from Radio 3 I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music making it really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works , I really consider it &apos;s important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to work harder to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
yet , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports began to kick off the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice on - the musical talent at the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for cost @-@ estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see one of why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; produced on special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he wishes that the company &quot; find &quot; a hit out of our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time it started a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money from the other payers to other Sub @-@ based formats .
Internet connection climbed in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this purpose .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month the lowest result existed since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online @-@ sales increased slightly three years ago by using phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual machine has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned to gh@@ ost towns .
however , experts say that there are now indications that online conver@@ sions are stag@@ nating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August show@@ cases the lowest increases in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales st@@ agnation , after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and going back to 2000 it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G @-@ Official Journal of The Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that the online @-@ sales increased three years ago , as a buyer in@@ closed with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the couch .
but now this is com@@ mu@@ red up , and we may possibly experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the slow@@ ing revenue .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which is held last Friday in November .
last year there were five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer @-@ sites collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday where the Bu@@ yers are fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers who could hold off their purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium was found that 5 £ spending had been issued a little more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases has now been performed via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the hotel cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca in the crane @-@ accident - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets
Saudi @-@ Arabia considering the collapse of some of the huge Sau@@ dic Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Gruppe .
the healthcare Ministry said that a total of 3@@ 94 people have been wounded after the crane threw
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed that were killed , as a crane to Mek@@ ong W@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .

among the dead found itself Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane threw down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Ha@@ j@@ j in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mecca by thousands who will continue to come into town .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group had not left the arm of the sick , when he was not used .
a Arab version of decree was published by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin @-@ Laden was also responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail did not tell , however , that the company &apos;s leadership was banned from abroad .
in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man managed to disclose , which caused the overthrow of the crane @-@ caused , which collap@@ sed to a courtyard of the grand@@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims occurred before the H@@ add@@ sch that later this month gathered .
the Bin @-@ Laden was not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ aded the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it was not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologists .

for decades the family Bin Laden has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and assumes greater construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden was a descend@@ ant son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990 @-@ 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , only few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials spoke that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials assume that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the fat@@ alities are to be paid and the same amount of permanently injured .
the last will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap European crafts@@ man is over
British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe took a rise behind
this leads to that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix stores set up on arti@@ sans , will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales fall nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city Chief @-@ correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is estimated that British companies put up their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home
if you can sk@@ ate with a hammer or a brush to con@@ gestion walls , you now belong to a minority .
because British are increasingly arti@@ sans who perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , a new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the farmer chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices may be over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to arti@@ sans and make 60 selling points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q @-@ Shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment the men prevail over men .
she said it was necessary to set the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , which carry more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we have to postp@@ one this to a balance .
basically , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also structured her top team , to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ fis@@ her fro@@ sted a decline in the half @-@ year gain and shows , after the group paid the costs for the left of the stores .
king@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the court
on Wednesday the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt have on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ register A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ agreements .
the defend@@ ants do not know himself guilty .
one of them was also charged with counter@@ abuse .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted of law in May .
the current process has been postponed .
according to Upper @-@ State Management Board , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ examination that the defend@@ ants were used in 2006 to 2011 money from club accounts on which they were used to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage occurred at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports@@ working are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact , the chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ ener , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in , came out .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the re@@ pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense represents that the association was not a asset of an asset .
the sports function would have only been calculated and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , from the debts rolled out in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 s@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we were standing before the situation : do we continue to block the club or lock ourselves up ? &quot; he told one of the defend@@ ants , in Br@@ ot@@ ok@@ f of the financial company .
then he decided to take on this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have prescribed money that is laid down our lives as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there must be no debts incurred .
furthermore , in terms of financial - success the payout of the exp@@ ir@@ ations was retro@@ spec@@ tively determined by 1991 .
therefore , I have noticed a part of the exp@@ ir@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus was in the account had been paid .
therefore , also flat @-@ sum and non @-@ detailed references , explained the former Ob@@ ower the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; managed the two defend@@ ants in common , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the withdraw@@ als have not been detailed in detail about the club , asked the judge .
the association did not be interested in the detail of finance , important to have been the debt of debt , so the answer .
in 2011 , as opposed to an official investigation for counter@@ abuse of abuse began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that may have been back , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ants and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent knew long no answer .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have awakened something of that money , the pro@@ secutor made in the room .
the co @-@ accused would have been informed , justify the function@@ ally of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; flood . &quot;
why claims in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know ri@@ chter@@ in and pro@@ secutor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never done any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom are you all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never referred to a cent content , he merely counts o@@ dom@@ eter and diets .
on diets he charged the association 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual cost has been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
these are according to a test , in which everything was assessed as correctly , no longer kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second defend@@ ant based .
all the lo@@ af@@ ings were made in cash , so he must go from his hometown to the International airport to the R@@ ise , stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

the U.S. technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client area within the framework of its restructuring .
as a result , costs are to be saved in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.7 billion ) divided the company on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.@@ 7 billion dollars , which will be all@@ ot@@ ted from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .

thus the proceeds from 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a shut@@ down and substantial positions for change in the industry .

Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the outra@@ ge of violence at the Border Ass@@ istance Mission .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke down the borders .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water@@ light ready .
40 to 50 refugees began to take shelter with stones , st@@ aves and plastic bottles .
the officials initially arrested un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tre@@ ach@@ ers was bre@@ wed in the direction of the refugees .
so the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have now de@@ br@@ ated something withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently li@@ mp@@ ed woman was carried away from the zone .

time for decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world is observed if the U.S. d@@ bank accounts on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade that interest rates are raised .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that F@@ ed would do this , now think the F@@ ed will keep somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may possibly start the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ wer view of global circumstances .
she warned the markets to hire an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20 : 00 CET on Thursday
death Prot@@ ector at the Delta State University left apologi@@ zing for the c@@ itation
after the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he later killed his colleague and killed Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he may &quot; pity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it in@@ done , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , called the Call number vs. 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot to someone and killed someone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the staff of the not@@ ch that the police need to send police officers to their home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lay my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but which no one will distur@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police stepped into the scene , they found the body of Amy pr@@ enti@@ ce , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could revers@@ ed it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note from 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were surrounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he has nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the event supposedly claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &apos;s no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a relationship relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ inde@@ ss were told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they had married about seven years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but did friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed &apos; on the ground &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement from Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of p@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had possessed a dog called Light@@ ning , having met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said I sent back to a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , drove his car to the side , fled to walking , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , he received a PH@@ AR@@ MA in the spring of 2015 on how his life cle@@ ars in the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly , because of a double under@@ clock
Luke Sha@@ w suffered the Champions League of Manchester at the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a dual carriage of his right B@@ one .
while this holds the left margin for top quality and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the court and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double blan@@ ket and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then I can operate in Manchester
it is terrible - a boy who gets to Manchester United with the age of 18 , it is very heavy and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room , he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a dual carriage , then it takes six months and he won &apos;t play in the group stage .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed lucky to be a Red Card and the suspension of a mo@@ an .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al affir@@ med that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself whenever I say that a mo@@ ose and a red card was required .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account lau@@ ed : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I will come back more strongly . &quot;
her@@ on related to Manchester United er@@ suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the European Championship has an added incentive in France to recover , with the European Championship in France .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a bein@@ g@@ ation when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at World Championship 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V players Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - by a scar@@ f by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax knows better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ orization .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favorite child book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 @-@ called environmental len@@ ght of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , for it seems always to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead publish a summar@@ izing of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details added to the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to meet the girl of his dreams , he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss summ@@ ed up and who died in 1991 , but is completely unknown .
as if this is not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially presented on the website of the Lor@@ ax movie , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ mati@@ atic father , it seems unlikely to Cameron is the action of the book so little familiar . here , an in@@ born boy , like the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ ore , trees fal@@ si@@ lu@@ sts , Th@@ rou@@ stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ eagle , despite the protests of the nam@@ ach@@ ute Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , sn@@ ur@@ ing , &quot; which is called &quot; desol@@ ate &quot; in the name of the trees .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ speaking in said that the text probably had come from Camer@@ ato &apos;s constitu@@ ent office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Mr Cameron has delivered to employees but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England , but it is still difficult
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but considering the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not shut out an out@@ going victory .
A@@ fre@@ est@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in bat@@ ting up , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not contribute s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball developed mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an un@@ familiar size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
in this regard : Adam Ly@@ th originates from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ players are oriented to results .
there was no question mark when Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best performers .
a long time ago the run of Ly@@ th was extended , but he had control of its own fate .
if he hopefully suggests further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss took his post@@ ure , even though he did not bring so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is primarily a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test @-@ perc@@ mann receives , to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and get ahead .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first appeared in the Caribbean first - when Ly@@ th was in high form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a percussion I highly regard .
he is a X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he had 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which made us very hit .
he must have at least the same chances as the one before him but this depends of course on the role of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ spin @-@ bowl and four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a head@@ man can &apos;t beat there , and these left @-@ handed have already shown that he &apos;s a Teu@@ fel@@ ic@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket player .
Mor@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop in 2001 before he emerged as a op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred cents and looked not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup chips that raise their hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team , England has made a few smart additions in the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Ar@@ awar@@ dee , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who has a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful approach to the Setup .
I always felt that he &apos;s designed for international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room , even though the messages are in harmony with the previous ones .
col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members determine not the schedule .
and you need to remember that like with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit option ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could gain access to the influ@@ encing when the economy takes up to 2017
David Cameron &apos;s re@@ fra@@ grant strategy to keep Britain in the EU will face deeper trouble with every day , even without the choice of in@@ geni@@ ous Jeremy , &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ bi@@ n for leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which crus@@ hed itself on Tuesday on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ bi@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Col@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at openly told us that some member states , so deeply moved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from our own debt , Britain &apos;s self contained agenda with spec@@ kled concessions and distor@@ ting contracting changes , which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C under@@ took on their annual general meeting that they may not je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se their social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
prime minister and finance minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of itself in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes to be a post @-@ out UK in the inside of the EU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and we have seen that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials from some capitals were up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s vigil@@ ant reg@@ istrar Angela Merkel is an allies , but it has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as it is for the gross@@ ly long out@@ lay people like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re@@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland has soon become a nationalist government , Spain with a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy from going out of the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , perhaps , some such ministers may even dis@@ su@@ ally no more helpful comment , totally in SN@@ P @-@ style , while the referendum release in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend thought .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ ad and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street is on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , as they did , during the period of Tony Ben@@ n inspired , approved in 1975 but did not exist , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can also remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportunity , who made a name for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels re@@ viewer in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his mani@@ ac , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sc@@ iss@@ ors , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ end foreigners and the pseudo @-@ In@@ countries that most of our large newspapers have .
actually Tony Blair looks similar to her , but found that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage where you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having to have lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ers than Blair itself , as he has responded to the adopted referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle passed by the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened up a door @-@ door .
the press never gave him this again .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on the back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he couldn &apos;t take any time for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ sc@@ ott Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake back then and now .
it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s official position for Europe is - I just express it - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ utri@@ d tendency and the wild goats of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well tell everyone about them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said not to admit that Cor@@ bi@@ ano &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ 90s , when his old father sought to be in television , loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to stay &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ns term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and Members to all reports on their Kl@@ aus@@ al convention on Monday .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline stays important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ care of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct , Cameron does not give a free card for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , how Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins ke@@ ep@@ eth sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ bi@@ ns fundamental multi @-@ deu@@ ces with EU membership - in line with its ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ ege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ sen@@ fest convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - will be obligated to be foreign diplom@@ ats to try and find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why do Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander in political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US already rather disappointed with weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government at the power , which was reminded at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
asser@@ tions of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by adopting the Public Health England ( phic ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
morph@@ ing , published the &quot; Basic &quot; report of the last month , describing it as an &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have wondered whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving the effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the affir@@ mation of that , &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based upon a detailed review of reflection and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people , who have been called to develop a model for a multi @-@ specialist decision @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages of various nicotine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting means to obtain funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they received after reports prior to the Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a variety of industries financing in the paper .
several other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a shortage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products at most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the phic report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of morph@@ ing that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes were deemed to serve smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being with morph@@ ing , said that BM@@ C has already been re@@ acted to the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ dictions .
all evidence suggest@@ ing that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to it are small but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
in other words , the unique obligation to inform the public about what is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative danger related to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0.000 people per year die of a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year .
by clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without any risks , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , says the former leader of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the Broadcasting position should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are commonly seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time@@ pieces against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company to join more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are on order or sends it clearly displayed by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to hold a radio fee , which means that I do not think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production out at least on programs that others do not make or order .
they send The Voice in a first time window , because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous ; it &apos;s natural nonsense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another one , admittedly , both self productions .
honestly , other channels would give your right arm for that .
I would be happy to see how this should be publicly available TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 addressed that the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows will announce that the former HEAD of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ equ@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 was suggested that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal limb@@ o programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfil their duties and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ crit@@ es missions for the justification of 4 billion £ circular fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one has seen . &quot;
they place it in a window in which no one they ever wanted to see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more regulated system in terms of conditions who can get the best value in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you think all that you will receive a great value for 150 £ per year , but for folks who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little from BBC production would now be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,@@ 1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the open @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ casting Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ S@@ son@@ o@@ ases &apos; can control bra@@ in@@ ic cells by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bro@@ o@@ ds of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they are filled with sound impulses that have been heard for human ear to high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by using Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels which are responding to ultras@@ ound waves .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new trial , called son@@ o@@ des , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
flu@@ kes are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ul@@ tran@@ @-@ waves are called on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onian channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
sound @-@ waves bring up the opening of these I@@ onian channels and activate the cells that they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create an ultras@@ ound Nem@@ ato@@ den , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onian channels carry .
when he uses ultras@@ ound at the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes , and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ ons .
the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ ases , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to capture and switch neur@@ ons with impulse of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ases could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that must be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , can le@@ ash ultras@@ ound waves can happen , and so can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the terri@@ fied human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin production cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , curator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lec@@ turer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries .
many artists continue to work with activists in the movement and notice that they need to go outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society .

V@@ C@@ CP certified by Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which prevailed around the advertising world mass - by a lead of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a re@@ alist z@@ wi@@ eli@@ tist company promotional , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .
what we need now is a move of the British government and the guarantee that Fol@@ ding machines are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally against our door .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism but only now I remember the tense smile of those who have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ minded complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the train in student residence ranges from light @-@ nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to to@@ ddle : people tell wh@@ ence you are coming , whether you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a fi@@ ery extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it inspir@@ es the conversation and helps you to find the people who you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were burning in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let human beings .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
in case of : don &apos;t remember to start at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ine obtained a crude treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space @-@ to @-@ space tri@@ um@@ mel culture which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you must go away so that I can get back the energy that I have spent for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comb@@ at@@ one is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of knock .
speaking of anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ absorbed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship connect by b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the clo@@ aca is on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve b@@ bed you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a great way to make friend@@ ships .
her room@@ mate feel obliged to entertain yourself and will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ ots of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping , when they anchor .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check the one with the dairy property .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the inside .
when someone ste@@ als your things is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it , as my room@@ mate , who added to your milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , the people from sleep , or from work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb says to the people who sit in the Glass House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , if it makes them a bit easier to turn for Drum &amp; bass some qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
you re@@ acted to loud music with even less music .
when she finally heard at 5 p.m. , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she checked her own music , closed her door and went down to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be very embarrassing for you to keep up a room@@ mate for your future spouses , who will go to her , and then have to see each day and maybe experience how they bring together all our common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own path - but if a hot co@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your spouse a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has its key in his not busy room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying are f@@ eins , than it seems .
a good straw is fun , but it only takes moments when he is to bo@@ omer@@ ang .
put through ent@@ ail a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but do not miss somebody &apos;s rooms with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close their door , and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then place in the freezer - but pres@@ cho@@ ke their domini@@ ons at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , non @-@ extrac@@ tive , Ger@@ ing@@ earned
the property contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid @-@ established district houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need for living room , but just as the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ bred &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to do this today at a cheap and well @-@ structured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the apartment market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass @-@ class accommodation in containers or sne@@ aks have no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in the face of the refugee stream , we also need plenty of living space for the next few decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a semi @-@ detached house needs a least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when the people of living in dor@@ ms .
each of the six houses built straight in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is in 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land .
this is manage@@ able .
six months the building took me .
this is reasonable .
are the construction regulations re@@ complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I have worked correctly my project correctly .
special complicated it always makes the suff@@ oc@@ ating Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ pi@@ ke special structure and the lock@@ space order .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still underlined , who creates three apartments in a row @-@ row , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities lack the space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants re@@ acting to their ter@@ rac@@ ed home project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have sent me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luxury built &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ bred near .
I am showing how to present themselves still cheap and well @-@ equipped today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS system when Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing to the set @-@ up app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tap General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users is recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the contamination of the updates . similarly , it will be simpler to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them anew as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or situated near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may un@@ folded up half @-@ way and might result in a breakdown of the updates .

bathroom Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the &apos; chess club &apos; chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen , founded three months ago , has recorded another member in his ranks , so the membership number increases to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who entertained himself more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bearer of the national representative 1st class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible to record chess players that do not charge the member fee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
youth work and talent look should also be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also the relationship to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for years we have been firmly established with our ambul@@ ant care service , that often nursing associates will be left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; we do not rarely use many services of the insur@@ ers because the complexity of the insur@@ ances will hardly be understood , &quot; explained the new land@@ lady in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ombud@@ sman , as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
beside the consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office offers also the prevention , health care and wellness .
in this case the S@@ alu@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , you can use additional offers such as storm @-@ prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the retirement centre and the S@@ alu@@ dis are complement each other perfectly .
S@@ alu@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .

witnesses seeks the police for an emergency in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in direction of Sal@@ oral .
one out of the group , a 17 years old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police had his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him .
at this time , the group was at the height of the ft @-@ gas station .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Sam@@ t@@ shared Grand@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and Ab@@ sen@@ dor@@ ff Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller to shoulder the practice wheels on 1 October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing after his successor in the coming months with half a page .
after a renovation phase , Müller again opened the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro into the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight , when the rock faces met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently graduated in medical education at the Wei@@ dener Hospital and will continue into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the troubles would fit well into this practice , &quot; Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ standing breaks and laughs .
&quot; when it was so far I was simply called . &quot;
the couple Müller ar@@ mb@@ led the idea to pursue its own practice in the future in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he will soon be his own boss .
and so one was agreed , the Mü@@ llers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , in his medical studies in Hanover , followed in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a consultant in Sul@@ ingen , further from 2009 he was appointed a guide in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged himself as a volunteer at DR@@ K @-@ willingness to Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ber works as a primary physician , his wife has specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ten , want to settle down as pets .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ lines and need a microphone .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely re@@ done .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro will receive the Mü@@ llers as part of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is carried on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ collaborative Master Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients coming to practice , according to Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll , every quarter in the practice reef , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice transfer by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ stan@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone .
he who visits Müller &apos;s Expert Consul@@ tation , by the way also continues to be familiar to familiar faces : is taking over the seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the field of rock .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber sh@@ atter@@ ies .
a little sad@@ ness , twist her after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband t@@ opped up : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now I have always pressed ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and besides , the pair has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our border line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to achieve a asylum application , which can also make it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of men is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migr@@ atory birds , not on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia &apos;s plans to travel to Austria and Germany to continue and under circumstances build cor@@ ridors for refugees .
so this looked after in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Slovenia the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia is already much controlled as the boundary of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to seal out its boundaries for refugees but not abri@@ ol@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees were already trying to pass on Tuesday to the border crossing the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d on the border crossing , in East Croatia on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d .
the Croatian police could attack it in the near ma@@ is@@ dies .
according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly met police craft with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
over the coming days his country with some 4000 refugees , said the Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
also , buses from Pres@@ evo at the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that she may be able to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do this nor want to do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b Border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day another bus would expect .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been on the road all night of the approximately 500 kilometres to the distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could now actually lead to a slightly further west of the Balkan R@@ ange of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary into a slightly further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible work@@ flow of refugees with refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have extensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU partners since 2007 has consistently been a positive testimony as regards the standard of border controls .
on the other side of the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees leave behind the Hungarian border @-@ border @-@ fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Medien@@ report they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border entrances to Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm mid @-@ morning at a local con@@ vocation in Hor@@ gos : he will hold the debates about alternative routes from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not happen at present to be very high refugees .
one could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Hel@@ per among migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the country &apos;s refugees on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war , there is still no cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police had announced that a de@@ mining team was sent to the border region .
market h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

in this way , investig@@ ators were reported a total of over 100 million dollars .

most of the defend@@ ants came from Ukraine and Georgia .

&quot; it is about life , that is why we went through the midst of the action in the midst of the city and under the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ enti@@ ce is provided by the pas@@ sers , as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteers .

over and over and over again , there are little discussions on the action themselves , about life , dealing with the dying .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some time the end of this world comes , I can responsibly live &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onic work of Mannheim , which is co @-@ operated with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carriers of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ enti@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public public action has been good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wanted to communicate openly on the boards would be clear , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and mortality was still vi@@ ti@@ ated with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the liberation movement in recent years has helped a great deal to opening up people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex gives permanent results for the final quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant expressed his profitability over a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ boat service .
the company also said that she is planning to recru@@ it around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell on 2.5 percent in the post@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends on the following May , 20 cents are less than in previous forecast .
analy@@ st anticipated according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view occurs despite the price increase , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on January 4 and despite greater access for bo@@ d@@ ants of heavy and large packages that are raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects that the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in the online trading will increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to susp@@ end 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million earned $ , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , slightly ahead of the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of z@@ ags Investment Research interviewed analy@@ st predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks questioned analysts about 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ cian shipping within the last few years that generated sales in its unit Express @-@ shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , turnover increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit increased higher income due to higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trading , approximately an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex stocks rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
at their most anticipated session in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark interest for the first time since almost a decade .
threat to them at an end of the dec@@ eased , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat @-@ sa@@ west is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maximize the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ even third @-@ time mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too tight to pre@@ dict them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by an unprecedented incentive since the end of 2008 .
though most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turmoil in the global financial markets could be more cautious F@@ ed @-@ representatives , to ampli@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it also just one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ r Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not raising the interest rate , the increased insecurity on the global market is enough justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a capital increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ col@@ ator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the p@@ unch by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday D@@ ow Jones Industrial aver@@ ages value 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ k &apos;s Capital at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sets at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they don &apos;t have to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a zinc increase would calm the financial markets because they would resolve the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow intensi@@ fication of the mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that this year they were in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August the improvement in the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate sank to 5.4 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation was continuously distributed under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can manage higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ Federal con@@ ome at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world ended last month after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by over 16 % in May by more than 16 % , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the global growth of the Chinese economy .
this month the market recovered something that the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives affect market upheav@@ al the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , senior Research Fel@@ low to U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China . &quot;
the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the central bank has enormous influence over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere note of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that F@@ ed can announce their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fu@@ sions all around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly connecting with each other , by the F@@ ed representatives , they cannot only monitor the developments in other places but also consul@@ ted with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month , that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which with apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
l@@ acker , vo@@ tive member of the Federal Open Market Committee , is committed to a global capital increase , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its leadership position by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limiting the impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ed these cuts .
F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis like the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a zinc increase , because the markets are upright , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains a double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be anticipated by the time .

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tried to clarify the importance of good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ heal@@ thful foods .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to be carried to mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating fluctu@@ ations in fact affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new am@@ ber sports hall
the Municipal Council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power .
the planning for the long @-@ looking turn@@ around at the Bern@@ sides of the sports facility come step by step forward : in the recent community council the elabor@@ ated component was dealt with without major discussions .
at the same time , the Panel had decided to have a request for a construc@@ ting legal , exemp@@ tion of &quot; respect &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a permission for a special design on the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof can be built with non @-@ consistent First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar power : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get a wonderfully large South , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; we went on to the attic conversion , for energy @-@ reasons - other than in the development plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no &quot; exceptions &quot; due to the per@@ tin@@ ction - whereby the am@@ ber rule is restric@@ tively restric@@ tive in the law of liberation .
however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the turn@@ around in the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots funding .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre @-@ large hall is now presented to the Council of the Council .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) , became the new Medical Director at the Ch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are what start@@ ling plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , in front of , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed .
a decision on the agenda , however , is the Supervisory Board , and the agreement on the coming Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans are implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees will be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be surrounded with fishermen and the wider inner station to Ch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the co @-@ workers who cannot work with Sch@@ ong@@ au can be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the staff are informed about plans .
triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic only since the beginning of the beginning and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
according to the question of who the successor , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who volunte@@ ered to take over the direction of October 1st and transferred with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case signifies the &quot; util@@ isation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the &quot; Inner Medicine , &quot; thus Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
fishermen are specialist for heart @-@ step and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
procedure for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board accepts that both houses lead , until then next year , the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which still has 35 beds , has to be closed after nearly 140 years .
so far the country had planned this for 2018 , as the current iter@@ ation is completed at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim .
Land@@ ra@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered forward to which the house , which is in the possession of the Federal Council , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end I go out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ We@@ i could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what was not about to happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ve to the Le@@ ch , which had been taken on positive and very comprehensive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , in which fishermen has worked for over 30 years as a che@@ er , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , com@@ partments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs .

refugees need accommodation : study warns against apartment gap
the situation on the German apartment market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since began .
with the incoming refugees and working people from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now bur@@ dened in many large cities .
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens for the last affordable housing apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , would have to be built 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study will be commissioned by the association &apos;s mandate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , this year is done in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units .
that makes use of 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees are not obliged to live longer than asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay .
many will then meet in the apartment market and set off in the long queu@@ es in front of the flat rentals .
according to the Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seekers remained to rent in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market lies not only on rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany sho@@ ots a housing deficit in front of it , which is bigger from year to year .
currently missing in the metropolitan areas already some 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals in large cities therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the flu@@ ff in the apartment market .
in the big cities the number of square meters per capita in the past few years has declined once again .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; social exclusion is propos@@ ing a new start .
in this process , new incentives are expected to boost social housing .
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed to the underlying tax and the basic tax needed for subsidi@@ zed flats could be stopped .
additionally , an attractive tax @-@ tax @-@ evaluation is necessary .
the sponsor program for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Federal Bank Kf@@ W is already well located in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million euros already more than half of the available around 300 million euros have been launched .
now the project could be tos@@ sed .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia leads to corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no man@@ oeu@@ vre , there are more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to cross the establishment of a corridor for refugees with the neighbouring country .
&quot; I have spoken with the slo@@ ven@@ ian interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian cour@@ minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is not a Schengen area yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ ters of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia declared to come to Western Europe from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV broadcast@@ er RT@@ L .
Hungary was sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that appeared in force on the same day do unnecessary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
on the morning the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to EU neighbouring Croatia .
most of the media are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and Ta@@ xen into the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she would have tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees did not break on the border .
for this the border strip contains other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ mining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can now quickly create a secure passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary there are hardly any refugees following the closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 people .
just before the gate on Monday we had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overthrow and damage of the border tell us as a crime .
the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged will therefore have introduced 35 criminal proceedings .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country to the sentenced to five years and deportation .
according to the immigration office on Tuesday in the newly at the border &quot; Tran@@ qu@@ ake &quot; a total of 94 adher@@ ed proceeds , almost all of them are - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicants , 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would be 40 refugees dro@@ w@@ ned there .
however , no one has more a prospect in Hungary to get asylum .
after the Russian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there are only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to regulate .
they gathered the rub@@ b@@ ish behind left the tens of thousands of people in the last weeks on the road@@ side .
barrier @-@ gri@@ lle were ab@@ out@@ laid and one of the camp @-@ camp in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to speak for the purpose of this transformation .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants stopped in government , but still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuing trip to Germany .
the railway traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the for@@ en@@ oon for the German authorities in the morning .
in fre@@ ew@@ heel ; regular groups of refugees meet on foot regularly .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ate &quot; above the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the tu@@ bs , when suddenly ten people were standing by Reis@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted with the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly for the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but for them in Wern@@ stein finished , &quot; Urban Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and went up together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the borders to the Middle Pass@@ au .
before we had the most hau@@ ghty guest again first , with j@@ ause and drinks .
we told you , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as coun@@ cill@@ or in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to commit a generous donation - 100 euros for fire@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Zug@@ tier passengers were moved on Sunday evening from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au to make it after the short @-@ term ann@@ unciation that the railway traffic was set to Germany , still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped , however before the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally highly in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ f@@ bound together with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday anoin@@ ting , tags previously a two @-@ nu@@ buck transport - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further cigar@@ s of us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ cris@@ y policy :
rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , in order to help the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor , officially , has lifted up highly and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the aspir@@ ation of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ly@@ re @-@ provo@@ king of these policies are not only those who are facing chaotic states now in the bor@@ der@@ areas with chaotic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the chan@@ gers will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us human conditions for guards .
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Conrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 hibernation
Konrad has full power to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is used for his word to weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker so as to turn accommodation for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first @-@ ready centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got around in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ ship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ ashing situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the ancient year .
in order to fulfill the number , € 3@@ 5.000 accommodations will have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 to the countries delivering to 15.000 der Bund .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the Governor .
they would have secured this , even for the coming refugees of Qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning to be trans@@ figured as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are putting the asylum coordinator into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals are able to offer private accommodation .
additionally you can get on hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally Conrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for their accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that lodging makers must respect a certain amount of the handles or the size of the so@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was successful in keeping with his experience , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom you cannot see without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the costs as they declared themselves .
their staff number want to increase it on three to four .
your own accommodation has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the square Stephan@@ splatz .
however , there are clearly problems with the approval .
Linz demands better distribution
not an opening municipal sports halls and other buildings like Tips Arena and Design Center for Det@@ en@@ tion of refugees is planning the City of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as people cannot find anywhere without these measures , the mayor said Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , further sites should be checked for their functions .
criticism is carried out by the executive director on the division of refugees within the country of the country .
also other districts must contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Ministry of Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) conducted a further approach to the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer proved to me that the German borders are not regulated .
the continued creation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now also the corresponding border controls .
special excer@@ pts with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
but the shelter would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
by the other EU member states , P@@ stir@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria again introduces controls to its borders is the logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Lin@@ zer Develop@@ er is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production facilities , the stock exchange office is placed on the stock exchange S &amp; T , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is meant to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we need to try that they are working for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies from the new ship@@ yard and to acquire what is equivalent to star@@ tup .
already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from where Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3,@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which is part of a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the Linz AG is well known from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters in the building are already rented out , for a further 40 percent give it to requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ er opened second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the centre of attention .
actually , J@@ utta wanted to put himself on a dog .
this project had to move the 49 @-@ year @-@ old indi@@ an of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market arcade market : after all , she has now got to get more awake in the shape of another business area .
in the Fur@@ la shop towards the business , where among other things sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clo@@ ths of different manufacturers , now all about fl@@ amen@@ able @-@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are available from 75 Euro .
bigger bags and accessories for up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks have been updated .
&quot; but I have long translated as if I want to open another shop , &quot; says broad .
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , came from the idea of an own location where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the spicy in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
her fashion interests has been wide placed by her mother in the cradle .
this is the most when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag was put in duty , the expert lady can not respond to the last certainty .
maybe it is because a nice bag has been upgraded to any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ver .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for all @-@ off .
whether he is himself on a foreign @-@ sensitive , journalist , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential government ra@@ vels the election violent .
and cuts good in doing so .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ city where the grandparents of the real estate might come upon .
the New Yorker with the sk@@ im@@ ment park is a concept many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants is about -@@ zig corners with him related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone L@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villagers think about his goal , mi@@ gh@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone L@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous explo@@ it@@ ches , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
to the king of the heart , he did not come there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there may be respect for the achievement of the family , but also tends to think that Tru@@ mp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit of a mas@@ h , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; random listen to the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the envelope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - too high @-@ language : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus coming from the village of At@@ am@@ ers .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 18@@ 85 , when the subsequent grandfather wander@@ ed and opened a restaurant in the US for Gold Rush .
foundation of the real estate concept was the first property in New York .
but the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to the home country , failed to the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once was without a permit , the director of the Institute for Pan@@ el@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a contrast one of the partly marked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cli@@ pping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case has repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Polish , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relatives of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the Op@@ a was borrowed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winem@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced themselves &quot; he is always such a thousand @-@ thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cat@@ ered around K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well appealing .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they hold it better if he didn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; who has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; if he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ilers Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
and &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tru@@ mp has been interviewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , have seen 12 000 movies , even in the U.S. is awakening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau bei Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the national park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ des received the award for soft tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Swiss Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; may have no more than 2500 inhabitants .

Seven &apos; s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership in the Today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son is coming to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of Nine has been broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ around the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ riad , tu@@ cked in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun .
this downside of the resistance seemed to play no role in Australian TV spectators since Sun@@ rise has aver@@ aged 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities , in comparison with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today the gap of Sun@@ rise has been closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 ran .
until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators on 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these dawn more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the old Seri@@ al of Ap@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama for a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand League , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son took a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answering this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and cutting slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening 2 of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe yiel@@ ded on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 PM to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday night , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia had 5@@ 20,000 audience members and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will be re @-@ agree that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree to the Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons rim , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly appear who The Bachelor is winning .
the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , finally landed , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we went with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons rim in the day , before you get out of three two , you may accidentally issued a hint about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues its lips to the finals on Thursday
all three women have tried out in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who is the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they could become the answers to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - unless itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a straightforward relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , because I felt that they were quite compatible and I have thought that over the whole course of the show , &quot; E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet on Earth , it is so fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the last week last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be a &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose to Wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday 19 : 30 , on Ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent inquiries after his impressive start @-@ day tour at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble , as was the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Du@@ eling in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team encouraged by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also public in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialty coffee coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who helped him to forget his vers@@ ed mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to have Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian trans@@ ood for its N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one just takes care of the next game , and that is it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne packs the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
he posed a photo with fans for a photo and holds an Australian flag after the game and played it on his Inst@@ agram .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to debate the rights of gay people
Mikhail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s guer@@ ite man , was arrested on a Si@@ berian tar@@ ma@@ c with weapons .

the Free voters demand for the high refugee numbers the c@@ ess@@ ation of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger , at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn at the beginning of a difficult crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools before the collapse &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get con@@ vul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian Educational System . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate will not be held until Friday in the Lower East Comm@@ une .
actually , quite other main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum is going to over@@ turn , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as they did during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we do not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to postp@@ one the Free voters as quickly as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administration , responsible for asylum instruments : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ti@@ fiers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards for federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to become more hand@@ y@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics is not to fall under the table in big Wal@@ ks .
the years of long bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
the new school year , Ludwig von Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has launched a pilot level plus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intermediate @-@ level plus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is tested for three years to extend the extended average level of three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to go to Ab@@ it@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums we want .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market has concluded a wide range of tra@@ il@@ less and nerv@@ ous commercial process with winn@@ ings .
only in the afternoon a fes@@ si@@ er pr@@ el@@ ude of the US exchange for a clear direction that finally trig@@ gers the D@@ ax by 0,@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ DA@@ X rose by 1.7 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
Euro@@ ph@@ xx 50 as the index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid gains also cover the business locations in London and Paris .
in the USA the D@@ ow @-@ Jones index came most about 1 percent in the plus .
many IP@@ si@@ ans therefore expect that markets to be released until after the interest rate in the US and for large exp@@ ir@@ ation at the stock exchange at this Friday point on the spot .
the discussion about the burdens from the atomic rising has pushed the shares of R@@ WE in the meantime to a record deep and also leave deep traces on eon .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy group probably lack an 30 billion euros for res@@ sions .
the federal government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies reco@@ vering something , ultimately ultimately 3.8 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares go to the D@@ ax tip by more than 22 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , investors are currently paying attention to the German chip@@ maker .
the investments should be expected to pay off in the future w@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus on the market .
Auto@@ values were asked : even in the traditional weak summer months of August , more cars were deduc@@ ted again than in the previous year period , like the industry association Ac@@ ea , at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the car@@ ers of the car@@ makers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2,@@ 21 percent .
Volkswagen power limits increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the survey of exchange rate dropped to 0,@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points .
the Bund @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro sun@@ k in the afternoon at least 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
against noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .
the cost of the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed , after police kill@@ ers shoot with demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber cord in a crowd that dis@@ assembled against the proposed new constitution , said a Beam@@ forming on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , premi@@ er districts , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside the police station , some of them threw those stones and burnt bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they resor@@ ted on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were hurt , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , of which they may kill , but which are traditionally used as less fatal alternative , obviously produced a so high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal as the southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ us say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ u who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since the 10 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed by centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legis@@ lature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature have voted this week in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu and have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot of land by the Alte Post is said to be converted again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
planned is a mix of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are not available .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to promote around 4,000 square meters of plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
planned , the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
wait for appropriate offers , it is said to be part of the city .
which investor to ask is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were signed .
the city Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Big Street , just before a few months bought and the adjacent building can be taken away .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for the holiday house on the little sea with Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor laid out public plans for the project first time .
quite a few tra@@ ilers are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure time
&quot; &quot; &quot; monthly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months was negotiated behind closed doors , salute , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday in the little sea are close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ ent , the medium @-@ sized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the agenda item on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , with the investors and management of secret society , Ralf wi@@ hr@@ sted away from the System @-@ Bau management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the members of the council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros and has been involved in the discussion since months .
fierce reactions among sea owners , which were come into the session , smell the images and new details about the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Mr Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , laments : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter@@ ance that over@@ looks like all other bir@@ des . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like a few other project critics that would increase the traffic by the intended size of the plant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there all the buses are coming , so that the calculation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the good a h@@ ect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , is however still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a key concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was not yet absent , even the development plans are still variable .

a different well @-@ defined low pressure system , approximately in the middle between the Kap@@ ver@@ dic islands and the little Anti@@ lles , has also a 60 @-@ percentage potential to form a tropical cycl@@ one , in the next two days , added to a tropical cycl@@ one , added in Miami station@@ ed weather experts .
Google will start dou@@ bling donations campaign to earn 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign , which is intended to help thousands of refugees that over@@ rolls the European nations as they flee from war torn by war and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach while announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of let a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our journey had many dark railway and bus trips , just as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugees and migrants are grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go out to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised from donations to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled in 11 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees also from the war distor@@ ted Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easy overweight diabe@@ tics can weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which had an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity have been proven efficiently to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are suffering from obes@@ e with a Body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that somebody is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can charge your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers used from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and ga@@ stri@@ c acid - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those , subjected to this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with the one that non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were received approximately at 29 .
among those , subjected to surgical procedure , at 36 % the type of diabetes is totally and at 28 % partly .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in contrast to diabetes is only about one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors out .
the researchers also warning the patient &apos;s blood levels from ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflected the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , the researchers write .
after surgery the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also performs average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group ( 18,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and here@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) , and recorded a complete overthrow of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show an survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study involving human beings in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to fat people who have undergone a adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of fifteen years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have collected these genetic changes that have connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love &apos;s History plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is often p@@ onder@@ ed in fiction : a young woman , too school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth , and he loves her in her .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; from Luisa bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she could have a literary monument to her homeland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and responded to the real crisis in the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called for an end to end the violence in the refugees &apos; countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of enduring refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , who dedic@@ ates ethics studies .
it demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed towards the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he emphas@@ ised that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousands of refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the US @-@ violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he made violence and have caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of in@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the United States report about a nearly 400 % increase in the number of children less than twelve years , which swal@@ low any alcoholic manual dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant , including Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from Hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the Gi@@ ft@@ control centers report , of 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the notes , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ab@@ utting off , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a nuts in social media .
videos on YouTube show how people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth have supposedly mixed a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a tougher drink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be f@@ elled from attractive jets to the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are the ones that are parked .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially with to@@ dd@@ lers can lead to a few sp@@ lash @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ entr@@ e Centre in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let a sip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and if children are coming from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently acquired four sp@@ las@@ ers of after straw@@ berry smell inf@@ ect@@ ant in school was brought into an emergency treatment .
their blood @-@ power concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which in an adult adher@@ ed to law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated it at the G@@ tiny Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ u@@ ded their words and was not able to go when she arrived at the shelter .
doctors monitored during the night in a separate pa@@ edi@@ ken@@ haus of the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , as the girl was lost by the alcohol and had reached the head , rehear@@ sh@@ ey said chi@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over Al@@ poison@@ ing , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death .
in 2013 two women in Ontario women died after the gor@@ ges of hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol has been contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which has been noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class were po@@ is@@ oned in the state of New York , their &quot; puppy &quot; teacher , using anti @-@ bacterial products all around the teaching area , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hill@@ de@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the discipl@@ ined measures to the authority &apos;s authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : damaged three vehicles
on a rear @-@ end attack on the cross @-@ br@@ aces between the North and Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist has been easily violated .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross@@ roads towards the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and took too late that at the roundabout two pres@@ cient vehicles had stopped .
in a result he pr@@ elo@@ qu@@ ished with his trucks in the rear of a Audi@@ s and whether this vehicle had a previous Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the un@@ fail@@ involved vehicles the result was caused by about 10 000 Euro , shares the police with .

there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , what was advertised from Griff@@ i@@ ths spontane@@ ously . this insisted that he and his team @-@ mates are not under hei@@ gh@@ tened control since they are preparing for confrontation with the Dutch table leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it .
the lack of a title competition in the Scottish football would be bored - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national @-@ player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic eff@@ ected , there are no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers there .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ranking are not there .
people here talk not just about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will revol@@ ve around , sul@@ ated di@@ kes .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la did not accept that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian head thr@@ ush , the things turn around .
after the defeat against Malmö and subsequent suspension from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now entitled to stand with five points lead to the tip of the table .
Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out of it as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need support provided by Celtic , because that makes the player better .
now together we are so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully at January @-@ transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ Chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate themselves what you saw with our own group in this season .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged throughout the period from May to July during the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period around 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent was about that of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cal ( ons ) showed .
in the meantime , the employment was in Scotland by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has put the cornerstone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have witnessed further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be witn@@ essing a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a viewer Gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip will be served by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the United States , and as often more applicants are available as seats , a flawless lottery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media areas of 12 to five .
who is chosen , who will observe it emo@@ tion@@ less .
I cannot do this .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone numbers and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we laugh many times when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access .
I refer to her .
she adm@@ its that she could have put it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the show of pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again for all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of having a benefici@@ ary of deed .
but I believe that a strong probability that he is not guilty of killing .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I shall see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pick him up and threatens to end the racing game
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install and dro@@ ck@@ oned a sp@@ y in his stables first year and re@@ bu@@ ked the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she ran a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai about a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he was able to find himself under difficult circumstances , when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ sample in Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage resolution , and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating long , but sometimes you are frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
they know that it was far far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I must live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about to go about it , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should no longer be trainers .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had brought the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ity department had tried to pi@@ ke its stable .
&quot; before the eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate - and offered him a work in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time today and are still today .
should I think that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L treat themselves and makes people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I didn &apos;t care for it , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the frustr@@ ations level of the trainer have built up with the long lasting Kob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ le@@ ased master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the racing days treatment &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which ran against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has sli@@ pped up mud on the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening like that .
it could have been the whole day just what was so .
it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who have set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need regulations , but here you have gone too far &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for cont@@ act@@ als against ri@@ vals
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ dant of his player as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster &apos;s Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring @-@ players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be allowed to match with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying final on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a hardly sli@@ pped note to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Queensland cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; prime example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland do not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ y@@ amy was the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ oma .
Bell@@ y@@ amy , added that the critique of two leading trainers in his team agree with him confident that she was worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; it emerges always and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring struggles , when they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed any of our defensive system or the techniques whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real emphasis and it has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already strange as this is always appearing again at this time of year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ y@@ amy is the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded its ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ting St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons held the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bored playing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ inge .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said it will take care of a partition .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as thrilling , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ y@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm is achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ s was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and do not points any points of gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the schedules .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet at a stage still .
the Storm team won free this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start from next service tomorrow .
Ser@@ bians with 200.000 $ 200,000 deposit to drug addic@@ ts
a man who could possibly get a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his experiment in possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that were pushed to Queensland , was released on a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu with August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how to put his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ing the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café from a harmless reason could have been .
the judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of such a matter , he was lied to the police concerning his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had provided a security of 200,000 dollars as well as security to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ ghty explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges flan@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from performing it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , announces itself daily with the police and goes to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to tigh@@ ten P@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of inde@@ cent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it by , found the confusing reports and aler@@ ted immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed computers , who were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research that used concepts for finding un@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g cont@@ ented with the officials that he would have done it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an would be to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ secutor of E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he adm@@ ills that seeking was conducted on the computer from him , said it was done because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an , to ag@@ ophi@@ le pi@@ ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said , He is sick in his head , when he drinks , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at tre@@ mb@@ ling and at wines .
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and made the defend@@ ants thus .
the girl was interviewed and told that the defend@@ ant computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , guilty ple@@ aded in the sense of the indictment to have rejected un@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , released on 25 January of this year against the conditions and not to be released at court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
def@@ ungs @-@ lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked to find that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one might argue that &quot; no such sexual element &quot; can be found in his ent@@ ou@@ rage .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from the judgment of October until October , to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted in this case , but was held in provisional custody due to hear@@ ings at other periods .
it was added before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
smug@@ gl@@ ary soft to small border out@@ puts to Germany
more and more refugees will be picked up from the big control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks can be found out of fear of discovery and detention of men more often at smaller borders .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , pedest@@ rians and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn has picked up more than 1,000 refugees in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on the German side by walking through bridges and dust .
there they are taken in reception by the federal police and passed on to the registration .
at the Munich &apos;s main station , according to the German police station , in comparison to the weekend , on Wednesday again significantly more refugees arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone until 8@@ pm are about 700 people in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man on the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the town had reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : st@@ ints of Tro@@ pen@@ ny &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologist warn of storm @-@ pl@@ ou@@ ches in the South@@ west of Mid@@ wo@@ e@@ afternoon .
because of a low pressure @-@ area across Western Europe , warm sea air is currently open to the country , sharing the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
the vigor@@ ous squ@@ ief is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the Tro@@ pen@@ ny &quot; Henry &quot; that was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days over the Atlantic .
heavy storms and thunder@@ showers are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ W@@ D is even up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the spon@@ ge of Al@@ b and in the bottom circle with Bo@@ ys from 60 to 90 km per hour .
on Friday we can see the sun once more .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 can be seen especially on the comp@@ actors who are currently selling at present .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand for : roughly 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals , according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new sub@@ categories and luxury cars , this year will be presented mainly to many new compact models .
one of the greatest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , who will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra model for us is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is part of the brand .
so the volume model also is well sold , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive .
Opel is placing an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf in the prospect of starting at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs starting from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
in addition , the H@@ esse supports further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp up to 147 kW / / 200 PS , which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder pet@@ rol engines .
unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra only as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible on the IA@@ A .
and what will we drive up to new comp@@ actors next to A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competition into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is shown exclusively as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT @-@ version .
in trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan brand wants to cope with the new model its position in the strongly growing segment .
moreover , the compact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Infin@@ iti &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adap@@ ts with its s@@ inu@@ ous lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model is given a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines , with a newly developed 1.0 liter engine and a capacity of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer @-@ information at 170 new@@ ton meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed all the comp@@ ass model DS 4 , which is visible at IA@@ A .
we set out the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Able@@ ton above all hand at the front part : here the cooler is newly drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior area , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IA@@ A in the compact class a series of over@@ jobs and new varieties such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary manor @-@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , who was accommodated in a small cell on the month .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally claim financial compensation , when they are stored in too small cells .
this has decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for the judges if they were imprisoned only a few days in the close rooms ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell containing some five square metres of ground floor ; the toilet was spatial from non @-@ dis@@ connected .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on an open foot in a larger cell .
his official ar@@ rests due to the dis@@ miss@@ al conditions against the land of Berlin failed .
but the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fier raised the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and rejected this case to a renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber start : decision on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons within the questionable time only a few days of the detention centre for the compensation would be decisive , be an obligation , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be an ob@@ sc@@ ure of the integrity of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of tax rep@@ ay@@ ment .
the constitutional mag@@ in@@ ers often have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they said only in April of a prisoner har@@ ness , because he was locked in a cell naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is to make a decision of 2011 also the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had har@@ assed a in@@ mate in a parallel event in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was taken over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in the same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the head@@ lines during the last weeks as well .
prisoners are therefore still locked up in 23 hours , raising aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to blows , it should be already due to the tense situation .
according to the arrival of the legal doctrine , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior lack , 19 shall fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is dedicated to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers are pursued after forecasts of the Federal Bureau of India this year to Germany , after statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates that in view of the unusual challenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will say again and again : we can do that , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
in different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built until now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatically , the lack of living space is above all at affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social apartments from the rental price drop out , and around these particularly cheap apartments will also participate in refugees .
the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments per year would have to rise and , for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
both scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agreed that there must be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees fle@@ dged in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they can find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researchers Diet@@ rich th@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , it has been a political turning point : out of the working ban for refugees to recognise labor .
while there was earlier a working ban for asylum seekers between up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ ories , the asylum seekers , to a residence .
indeed , in society - also because of the qualified labour - mostly the perspective was taken that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labor market are missing German skills .
until now , there is still no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of networks is therefore according to the throne of the throne , from the royal road to labour integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin School @-@ based school has found that few elderly parents put their children into the kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ gan@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to see the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes management paper in various languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity - for example , if he allows more specialist training .
in the countries students will be prepared for education in training classes .
however , they are not always taught by well @-@ trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language .
there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ ams from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
generally , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or thinking about the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be easier to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or d@@ ul@@ ing do not receive any benefits according to the asylum @-@ law Act when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter , basically , is not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as she does not fall under the circle of the con@@ domini@@ um persons .
patient refugees had to have been living in Germany so far in order to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens this span on 15 months .
but this financing is also needs to be closed , we call for Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should admit the same rights as it should have the churches , and the existing state will develop the existing state churches to a new state of religion .
also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who professionally take care of the new arri@@ vals .
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must be clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a willingness to address religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern on Thursday , religious conflicts might also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to emig@@ rate such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Broadcasting Corporation .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arab .
integration will be much more important in the future than today .
this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have a anti @-@ discrimination status as a result of European decisions , and an Appe@@ al Act .
however , it is getting very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ al series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all migrants &quot; migrants and stakeholders in non @-@ white German have long been calling for long @-@ term international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ist violence in Germany , needs to be realised in the coming years when the country will remain peaceful and take advantage of its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally provide support for the far anticipated refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NAID President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what affects al@@ - power and capacities , we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money is required to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires all arri@@ vals equal to the registration of health cards .
the services could be rec@@ laimed later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run it is highly questionable . so many people are ex@@ po@@ ised with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seekers can see .
otherwise , doctors make primarily the language barriers .
in so far , the Berlin scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical offices would have to charge interpreter &apos;s cost , they demands .
it would be helped many refugees but also with more general medical appeal in the emergency treatment .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under attack there are about a lot more untreated disabilities , and for the young people there is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly different path@@ ologies , German doctors from their training were clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parasi@@ tism and tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to identify &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and what concerns the doctor &apos;s shortage , be perhaps even reli@@ eving the refugees in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have been a developed education system , several refugees even have doctors .
in order to practice practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and may not take back examinations again .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post@@ injury disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee camps , declares Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent published study by the Technical University Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , amongst other things , with so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory disorders , di@@ zz@@ iness , and de@@ x@@ ieties .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to avoid that symptoms would be chronic , be necessary as early treatment , stated Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive refugees in Psycho@@ therapy .
though , mentally ill @-@ seekers can place an application for psycho@@ therapy , but the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly Sax@@ on workers or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic diseases are not intended to determine whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; I cannot imagine how to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ gh@@ er and Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current center stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a totally different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year old j@@ uni@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosmopolitan atmosphere , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Com@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinced by talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their crafts .
with the heroes of the silent movies I want to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and mo@@ tility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s planes in the storm .
apart from a number of salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus itself also fascinated with flair and laughter .
how to balance bike on a sphere ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
slim people fascin@@ ates and fascin@@ ate you at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little else and fascinated by their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals are part of our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte .
mis@@ fortun@@ es in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject of different animal protection organizations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; if we are not doing well with our animals , it does not work well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every cu@@ dd@@ ling unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fourth @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read after every request from the eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal not feel well , it does not want to into the ring .
so the first commandment is good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is proud .
the two animals have spent eight years in a en@@ closure and nothing has happened .
&quot; Oh then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte .
the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the riding arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus itself .
thus , for every visitor something is likely to be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or more 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with full heart . &quot;
the Circus held August 17 and 20 every day , between 17 and 8 pm on his performances .
Sunday , the program starts at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the rates are reduced .
furthermore the animal protection is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Sim@@ pl@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ el@@ dest leader , came down the stairs beginning of the year on a podium .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls rapidly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they would have obtained anonymous victims and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bu@@ cks .
last month they had booked it and lost him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions makers have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which instruc@@ ts them to inter@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the affected Parliament members that immunity lifted in parliament , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .

H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to demol@@ ish about 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction results in a load of more than $ 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who is to guide unity according to separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of businesses that assist businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has over 50 billion $ yearly sales and &quot; will be focused on providing so @-@ to @-@ benefit technology solutions for companies , &quot; says an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce elec@@ tro @-@ systems and Palo Alto garage to be the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring of restructuring to tackle the coming from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused enterprises provide better performance .
arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as its rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame regarding this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season following a separate knot@@ ting injury and then back to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , that is not well @-@ healed .
it is not a big matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in touch with his knees , or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from the medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd shares 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ire in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have recorded most offen@@ ders .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; L@@ ess said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and going through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its champi@@ ons season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lanes , next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Lin@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give players that need to get a small gap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ess said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the arm@@ our are clear favor@@ ites , by group F to continue , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the greatest intimi@@ dating effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been started .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake which measured on the Richter scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains of the distant hope to lead with his management the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more dist@@ res@@ sed than ever before , as su@@ icide would prove to young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ Ho@@ ch .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ rant ( Cal@@ m - campaign against an inherited life ) in 2015 considered the year of the man to ask the culture to ask the men to seek help when they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had doubled its chances of recovery .
for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you just have to have friends in order to make friends work .
in the age of more than social media guided communication , focusing on substance about substance is often more important than in@@ significant contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , vital and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ ins@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money really cannot buy .
the Beautiful in Friends was that this focus was placed on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers of hu@@ gs hu@@ gs , moments while playing football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it , even though they often go back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the call @-@ care I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hear@@ tening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; role for people who feel depressed and com@@ mur@@ ders , who really showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind if I try to offer long @-@ term loading mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status of the phone people may also look at humans in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you can visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with the perfect setting of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone left alone , give him a smile and say Hi .
you never know what kind of friendship could make .
friends is sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to mal@@ ign@@ y
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ Baptist Cav@@ ani after his hit to Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ting Par@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday started .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ate as PS@@ G players , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards she pas@@ sed a number of occasions before she finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani at the 6@@ 1st minute a head @-@ ball scored .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish masters , since they not only strive for the qualification for the N.@@ O.@@ C. , but to improve on the path to quarter @-@ finals on each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a clone of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs dis@@ missed chances in front of the gate . he later began in play against his hometown team and against the association , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative work in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting throughout the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret we don &apos;t yet have one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was released in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing &apos;s wing has been described as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö defence , before he passed to Johan Wil@@ and over into the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed , that PS@@ G was able to win a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , which provided Celtic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this stage , came at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national play@@ mates on the field and was batt@@ ling a heavy enemy with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far to Kevin Tr@@ isha P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave himself on , with some failure and bad degrees , not least by I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was seized in the first half in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani .
despite this he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that turned Di Maria into a turn@@ around that was subject to the pole position by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts on that Malmö could come back to the game and only a excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result low before the replacement is purchased as equi@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , announced later that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the quali@@ fiers are not enough . &quot;
hat in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then they do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; said Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the acting from The Mar@@ tian has committed himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the produ@@ t @-@ mates Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , who is beaten up by her white turn .
the producer of De@@ ar White people sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ trac@@ ted that their direc@@ tional &quot; At the end of us could give something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter , Mr Po@@ oni thrust his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - that &apos;s SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned over 5,000 re@@ ets and 4.000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons Com@@ ments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teenage son of Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter &apos;s country wide impact and ur@@ ging law@@ makers and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against color @-@ areas .
in February , the singer Prince took a stop on the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ inees of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album silent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , the leaders of Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the pop@@ e in order to discuss about the appearance of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; cryp@@ ted Champion
professional athlete and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday Even@@ ing and took the Big Prize of 1 Million $ .
the competition show , which finished off their 7th season , has never experienced a contest of competition , who was able to finish all steps of his obstacle course .
during the season there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the Fin@@ als .
the climbing task was to climb at a 75 foot long climbing , in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had completed the task within the time which he had completed the first athlete who ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ en@@ ero ended this challenge in full three seconds quicker , making him the winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a@@ ero spoke with E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the great prize of 1 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as suddenly as suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with the Hollywood re@@ porter in order to discuss the Fin@@ als and why B@@ ritten , although he was first ended at all the course , does not get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he had something like that .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards by fans .

Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ O@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League .
the Tig@@ ers are pared down to their role as Spo@@ iler , they played this part however on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins were shot a chance to climb inside the Houston parade for the second American League of Wild@@ Card .
for Detroit , even if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that has been so difficult to grasp more than a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tiger &apos;s manager Brad Wor@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support , when Detroit offered three times in the first two levels , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times on in the 1 / 3 inner and enabled three R@@ us .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw at the bull@@ seye every game and therefore I want to go very concentrated in the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ Hitler Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gri@@ pped the head@@ land well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the drums , saw distinc@@ tly better from the bull@@ seye , and he carried it straight into the game .
with three R@@ us in the back of the seventh year , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center field@@ der B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field .
Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a pit@@ ch@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ise Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy covered wall , the only man who was faced with whom he was confronted with attorney R@@ ookie @-@ Head@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who is the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run in the second he carried the third b@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ps to a double Play .
it was the second league for the 27th times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ps hit a double Play .
after Detroit added a Insurance Group at the end of the ninth block , the Wall abolished an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed sla@@ p however S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ itted to the start of the game of an even im@@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ us in the first two inner court against the Right @-@ handed veteran , which was rep@@ ain@@ ted prior to the game of the risk of injuries after having been ste@@ aling for more than a month because of a back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I was moving and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there on the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first of the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man , gave her a single at Second Bas@@ le Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z game , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track record with the runner in the scoring position .
the third captain of Nick Castell@@ anos , with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , as he tried to get to the third , giving the threat .
the Tig@@ ers stood in the second , made a one @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose at the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ pot .
he did not have very well beaten , but he did not catch the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before it replaced by the rel@@ ic Right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came up to three R@@ us at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez , because of a violation of the wor@@ ship@@ pers .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .

with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is rep@@ ain@@ ted by the risk of injuries to fight against the T@@ wins .

several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ischen state capital have been prepared in the last days for this case .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily take place there .
it will then be distributed to other municipalities .

Ischgl : German military action in Syria an option
the Chief of Mün@@ chner Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we have been glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict came out in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for massive rising of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled south and eastern borders
to Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary , nobody now returned .
Germany also sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; explained her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement , after Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there was already discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers gave them not and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man asked for an extraordinary summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with passing border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to arrive at a special meeting on mandatory distribution of additional 120 000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee sheet in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the in@@ up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Government will manage this together with the countries , calling for Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , for those people , the protection , de@@ pl@@ ating this as well .
but he who has no lead @-@ perspective could not remain in Germany either .
this opinion has been divided in round in round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole would now be calling for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of distr@@ acted refugees are now stuck at the bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had reached its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia on the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent that smug@@ gl@@ ers were seeking out of Romania over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister said Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to the planned new border @-@ fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; can be found in the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us

man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .

because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B nutritional vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. most of all included man@@ goes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
whoever eats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolism processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and sm@@ elled .
the form@@ work @-@ color alone says nothing about the ripe fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very delicious .
they should store at room temperature and consumed within a few days .

first F@@ itt@@ y , then distinctive K@@ alt@@ front
the next night breaks down in the valleys of the alpine north of the F@@ öh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and Wednesday night the F@@ öh@@ n partially blows the storm with storm @-@ strength .
after the dar@@ ing on Thursday morning we crossed a striking K@@ alt@@ front , that puts strong rainf@@ alls , wind bows and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland currently stands on the forefront of an extensive low pressure @-@ area above the British islands in a powerful southern @-@ west .
on the alpine north side breaks the night for the Wednesday of F@@ öh@@ n through the valleys .
in the episode the F@@ öh@@ n che@@ ered up until Thursday morning in the ra@@ ils with Bo@@ sia from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and specially in Ur@@ it@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h .

Rome has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square .
in the presence of the city president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino was held on Wednesday a previously un@@ suitable place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was submitted for the protest@@ ant churches in Rome by the working community .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es could only live over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith .
the square is in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held itself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city then as materi@@ alised sin .
his negative impressions showed him more marked in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
he had then introduced his Th@@ eses against the las@@ h@@ las@@ h@@ del , the division of the Catholic Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the capitals that Oth@@ mar ( old ) painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with outstanding pictures now .
at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Old , formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his very personal interpre@@ tations biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted the respective subjects , it may be quite ble@@ ak .
about three years Ot@@ mar @-@ old worked to his Bible @-@ project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; books of all books . &quot;
emerged are cycles that apply issues such as cross @-@ ends , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
he has immediately fascinated several partners spontane@@ ously : this is true for the Luther House with its the@@ ological orientation as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books .
and that is , in particular , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who dealt with the painting of the painting with the respective scriptures .
he has interpreted the Bible that has been interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt - and today into the current context . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original scriptures from Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who put his very personal thoughts on the respective situation here .
the jewel @-@ band has Golden Let@@ ters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant reign of the religious community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the education already happened to the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work hard to re @-@ carry myself again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re @-@ show the art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of images are moul@@ ded today by complaints , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness .
pictures still have some mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Old would like to let the viewer take into the pictures &quot; come down , &quot; discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post rock on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible within the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; which has always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands his life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not take care to remove the Bible completely , but that selected for him important , even mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas image - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be presented at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ foundation on 15 November .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment for refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga made a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the mounting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems facing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since the reunion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be interested to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S @-@ Chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m following Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the Minister of Tourism in O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and want to help .
but the crucial course needs to pose politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football club has therefore expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program will run until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal lig@@ ists support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ eine shows a clear sign if they are on the left @-@ day of the Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship of sponsorship ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distribute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; says Le@@ verk@@ usen , Sport@@ al@@ ates Ru@@ di Fi@@ é of the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) , and recorded the project as a matter of course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee &apos;s drama deals every one , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer league , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Manager Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent signal of the League . &quot;
the Euro @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday inviting the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties have started their own projects in their places , be great .
what is great about the fact that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent will be in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous significance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year the association , together with the DF@@ B range and the federal government , is at its disposal 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already announced the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( thunder@@ bolt ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its leader H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to be up again if you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out with skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen &apos;s tin@@ ting a relative picture and explained that he suffered the injury as he was shortened by the wheel .
he thus comes as little as a reservoir in Singapore on the weekend as a reservoir for the two families of Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ure @-@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will finally be sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player will be missing the leader of the soccer league of the soccer league alongside the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 AM / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether the event will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , we left the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of his professionals , K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its ancest@@ ral position at the reel &apos;s position .
so he announced a change on the door position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the place by tribal Roman Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he is trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the World Champion .
whether the Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe league games , but he nu@@ ck@@ les open .
with high probability , he will also manage the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ged statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ alist must be for the BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the aim of veri@@ fying mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehensible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Marco isn &apos;t that wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot welding : government wants to take a role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ cated by the federal government &apos;s will in the change of cars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technological technological &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cab@@ inet thus decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand IA@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobile era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and networked driving will increase road safety and make for less steel , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the issue also with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which at IA@@ A also meet with representatives of industry .
the strategy &apos;s strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band installation and a growth of broad@@ casting on digital radio broad@@ casting .
a test circuit is currently being created on the 9 in Bavaria at present time .
in order to allow the driver to be &quot; no additional risk @-@ risks , &quot; the federal government intends to review the legal framework , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
thus Germany does not want to use internationally for this , that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars can be raised from 10 to 130 k@@ m@@ h .
the German government plans to apply to a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that can capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly @-@ automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , trouble @-@ free vehicles on public roads will be expected only far by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added value in the field of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions at the Federal Republic of Germany will appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; digital connectivity of the cross country can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD &apos;s SPD member of S@@ itting Bar@@ ra@@ l .
however , the issue of liability in in@@ securities and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified .
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a summary of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute , resulting in the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years , and 32 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of the respondents reach cars , up to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving car .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control throughout the trip on all roads .
on the highway , the traffic could still imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
almost every Fourth would be left to the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Tab@@ le@@ ong @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will only want to fight the title on the title of September 25 to October 4 only in the single one .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys got to know it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to even without him to clin@@ ch the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bundest@@ ur@@ ns Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ textbook in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a sponsor for sponsorship in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be held on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single @-@ European ister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ als in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European Championship in Sh@@ ams .
&quot; back then he did not miss , and we have become Europ@@ ame@@ master . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should base ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world tran@@ far@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English soccer player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has contracted a heavy injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck .
it is a mix of very large fashion show and a qu@@ w@@ ns pop @-@ off . the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) showed an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ nequins , which look aw@@ ful thanks to video projects frigh@@ tening human .
they carry the spectacular creations from the French designer , which among others became a great star scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ ad Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before it was light , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om &quot; side@@ walk on the tre@@ p@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a luck that the Mo@@ dis@@ ch@@ aser has changed its initial position towards a show of its person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made Montreal , in Canada and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it comes to tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly an impres@@ sion@@ ing work of the man , who has written the fashion history , without ever completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work , for which much effort was operated : in order to fr@@ ise dolls , for example , a Sty@@ ro@@ list was engaged .
14 tons of material made the movers according to details of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October legend , it was still a special note : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are lau@@ er than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ dy old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d o@@ iling @-@ side of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he discovered the dis@@ c@@ ashing of fashion then himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but I bought it later but of course .
for his first own fashion show , he could not pay the model .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long nit@@ rogen @-@ machines in and around chew@@ ing to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips have been produced in large quantities for customers , who for example they worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ ra@@ yon &apos;s Gro@@ falls .
instead , the fashion is important .
at the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s peak , fashion played a major role , was then mis@@ ed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
at all fine the so @-@ called vintage mode , which leans towards past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , an increasing contractor .
those in the textile industry in Germany are no more cat@@ ers , is no longer on the market .
for us they already make half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cking @-@ seats together with nine other companies is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
about 80 percent of its sales were destroyed during the last 15 years .
private stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no more .
we hardly reach our products on this road .
the mass waste products are manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed on chains .
furthermore , weak@@ ening of export , currently based on Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also attempts to score points also through environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nit@@ ric per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we are leading a seal of quality , that shows that we produce environmentally sound and socially balanced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt supplies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also relates to the used materials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma @-@ design U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snail of the West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to deal with the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , who must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only varies easily to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter features the historical snow @-@ all@@ u@@ head again .
sti@@ cking the machine at some places small kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ e@@ de@@ filed in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt was inspired by it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ all@@ u@@ pointed for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s point - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies them to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to clients whose ancestors used in chew@@ ing and surroundings and would like to have a reminder .
as a result , I see my jewellery as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside in order to boost growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was asked to manage the reform .
&quot; China should aim to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the central management group for a deepening of a comprehensive reform .
to boost new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the leadership group has adopted a number of policies , including a neg@@ ativity of regulation , recovery , border controls policies , support of government agencies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of the milking system .
according to the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies the sectors and companies that do not respond to investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of significance , since it indicates the market a greater role in the provision of resources , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls to the powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how they will manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of trans@@ national economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , other areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; if the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important protest like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double up mer@@ cur@@ y border in predat@@ ors
the European Commission plans to double the threshold values for mer@@ cur@@ y in big rob@@ bers and consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ative work in the EU critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects failed industrial and environmental policy are passed along with full weight of pregnant and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the threshold values of the nervous system should be lifted for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of one to two milli@@ grams quot@@ as per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , big predat@@ ory Fish is so heavily charged with mer@@ cur@@ y that on the basis of the remaining threshold values , approximately 50 per cent of the barrel is not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the threshold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be f@@ atten@@ ed .
in return for this lo@@ ader the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram Qu@@ eck@@ y per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , was signed as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ d@@ fishes , such as car@@ p usually are so low , that they are already respected the planned maximum value today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crash at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distr@@ action distr@@ action that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one for the human @-@ poison@@ ous heavy metal , which has heavily ra@@ zed over the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
the federal government warns against that &quot; already small amounts of particularly can cause in the injuries of the nervous system .
the Federal Department of Environment states on its website with regard to the current maximum value , but that a &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is mainly through coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of German , German coal @-@ power plants encounter more than six tonnes of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish in the Elbe , Rhein and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and surface &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cur@@ y in fish have already been reported to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
