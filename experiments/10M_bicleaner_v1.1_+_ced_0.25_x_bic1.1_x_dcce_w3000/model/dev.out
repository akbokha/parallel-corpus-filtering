Obama calls for a silver
the relationship between Obama and Benjamin is not very friendly .
the two wanted to destabili@@ ze the international agreement and the backing of Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but in the meeting it should also be concerned with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution .
for many years the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is stretched .
Washington in critic@@ ised the continuing settlement @-@ making of Israel and raises the will@@ power of peace process at a time when it comes to a peace process .
through the help of Obama to the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu had a cont@@ entious issue at the invitation of re@@ public@@ ans before the US Congress , partly in the Cri@@ mes against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this by pointing at the time of the election in Israel .
in a staff called Professor , his girlfriend have shot
in a staff , Professor Sh@@ annon wrote a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surrender it was important to acc@@ entu@@ ate that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house found the officials of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ce and a hand@@ written note , I wanted , I couldn &apos;t go , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lying in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , graduated , already 300 miles on the school grounds , where he was shot a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , shot a door to his office and killed him .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that after the dre@@ am@@ ful emergency number one eventually made out .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police kes@@ hi@@ ked him .
a day after the shooting at the university , the students and faculty to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators who knew him , helped to record an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were enjoying their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal pre @-@ history .
he was mentioned in a book written by him in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; he shared his academic life .
both were meanwhile in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members got 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there have been some incl@@ ination about problem @-@ related behavi@@ ors .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , he also seemed a little upset and nervous , &quot; as if something had been wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mi@@ dian Sy@@ kes , told him that lamb was told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
light had previously requested the Delta State University for a carriage of health reasons , saying that he had any medical problem either .
in this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the University meant that the promotion , for which Lamb was so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to work as an assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wi@@ ped nothing from a conflict between Lenin and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that we can no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus the police found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Arkan@@ s@@ as imports .
before he could be arrested , killed herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber Pist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran out of the trip .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 he started his work at the University , which has 3.@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy .
he received a PhD in Spring in Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs signed it as an intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was then the women &apos;s flock .
all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson H@@ stadt of Bran@@ don inhab@@ itable .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did die my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which adjacent to one Ba@@ you in Gau@@ ges .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced at the age of 15 but were friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally wre@@ cked off the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met him , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail emerged three years ago both in a summer year .
later they played together one or the other gig .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writing and sing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man , and sometimes a entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le &apos;s Room , a weak lit bar close to Gau@@ tier , told him to finish his guitar player &apos;s guitar accordion and harmon@@ ic@@ in before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clean@@ room and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the first @-@ term professor , led the former semester seminar programme and specialized in American Native Hawai@@ ians and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three young children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and students .
on the Delta State University in Cleveland participated in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community participating in a cand@@ l@@ elight appointment .

the classes will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ entic@@ ing Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans having contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police then stated that after he shot the not@@ ary , and that lamb was shot in his emergency back as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox Holiday on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty and it is gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it appears in my mind that I am a simul@@ ated char@@ m@@ wood and an ar@@ mes@@ length of it can be a date with the princess of Wales on a date .

UN Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN CEO again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support Integr@@ ative negotiations on the Fin@@ der of a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the General Assembly of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ore that the post@@ pon@@ ies in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called for five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , who have demonstrated it in achieving nuclear De@@ als with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 push @-@ values show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taking seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for an collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to draw Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys down@@ ward , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claimed that Tru@@ mp will probably win the republi@@ can Nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 , Rick &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman C@@ ain , which no one has even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ side groups like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s through@@ s and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey levels that suggest that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s expos@@ ing levels have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced their can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
these figures remain in the early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has realized last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good idea of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ torate would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
just two out of 10 they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he was the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son provides about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; mad &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would .
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans see truste@@ e temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of the voters in the Re@@ public@@ ans believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pro@@ secutor of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for an commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent that he did not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six out of 10 Independent may say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their nests , can hold Republi@@ can voters bu@@ mp for real .
if asked , who won the GO@@ P Nom@@ ination , tell one survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the time of July , when four of ten ended its money in Cal@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est Crystal Ball in the past .
at this stage in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards only 28 % for the final candidate . Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters are looking at Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ si@@ bly .
even if the Republi@@ can raised itself by another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still taking almost everyone .
some experts suggest that the spl@@ itting field contributes significantly to Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s leadership while the Anti @-@ Tru@@ mp Support is now distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ head between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp calls for multiple support .
he has front of the early Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , especially Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , especially 15 counts 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ head with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey done by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters want to support the Tru@@ mp for giving them to their votes .
of course , much can happen to change it , and no one can truly say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tru@@ mp .
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp for immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign launched two months ago from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration and fishing hub was in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp is crucial H@@ isp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and the re@@ oriented efforts will be damaged .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday 6 of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , that they agree with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration .
as long as the immigration in the lim@@ elight remains , it will appear Donald Tru@@ mp apparently .
the frustration of the government climb@@ s up to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son deals with the support of Republi@@ can voters , particularly their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than have someone with government experience .
and they are angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; rude . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive accomodation units in Germany
here is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street it costs a square meter of a th@@ et@@ roof house compared to 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers are the most cost @-@ meter in the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s Top @-@ residential locations , one of the prize comes as pe@@ anu@@ ts .
the real estate service provider &apos;s premi@@ er provider has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square footage into di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
that one has several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the forefront here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
tw@@ o@@ ken Tor@@ ro@@ e in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky match by Thomas Müller paved the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran .
a sou@@ cher el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario I@@ tz@@ e have decided to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel and Piraeus , in the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their launch game in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers doubles ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ tz@@ es results ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth generation success in Serie will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the Sc@@ ary pot@@ t after Munich .
Müller received his 28th issue in the Champions League of the Champions League for the defense of the Olympics @-@ go@@ al@@ ers Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world &apos;s Grand Master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; had Bayern @-@ captain Philip Lah@@ m before the game at the Kara@@ is@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans promise - and the Mün@@ chner stopped word .
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without having to shine .
Piraeus had gained his recent six home@@ games in the top class , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also proud here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ conqu@@ ers , did not want to be the next victim .
they were brave , with their aggressive efforts , but often to come out of work .
the attacks were introduced often by play@@ back on Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely met against the former Braunschweig Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than its flan@@ k from the right @-@ field in the left upper front in the upper left corner .
at the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ alistic ide@@ ye Brown the head of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct disp@@ ens@@ ation , the Tor@@ ah Roberto with his knee ( 3@@ 5 ) .
though the Bav@@ arian her are habit@@ u@@ ated in the game , Piraeus could put N@@ adel@@ ou@@ che .
on Tor@@ ro@@ y Manuel Neu@@ er however was the entrance .
so for about , as he had a shot of ide@@ ally on the cru@@ x @-@ drew ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola took a four @-@ party with David Al@@ aba in the center beside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WC @-@ hero gave the green light only after the final training , said Sport@@ pr@@ ist Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first turn Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he did King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the he@@ aders ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and did 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ meters made Müller still a dr@@ auf .
before the game had come in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ all .
after a smaller group of partly squ@@ ander@@ ed Bavaria fans in their viewer @-@ block apparently had prov@@ oked the followers of the hosts pir@@ ated with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with impact on the Munich &apos;s followers .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , prevent not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : if the risk is decl@@ ining the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tion@@ ists ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking , the risk of losing their teeth was pre@@ matur@@ ely to shed the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had watched over 23@@ 300 participants .
major causes for tooth failure are tooth decay and inflammation of the tooth decay , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ sizing the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ um inflammation in smokers .
not clarified , to which extent smoking increases the risk of dental c@@ aries .
people who heard it smoking , could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it can take more than ten years to the haz@@ ard again to the level of non @-@ smoking , the dust @-@ established Thomas Diet@@ rich explained at the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one should persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smoking , explained trial manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and containers and also leads to our findings to a good dental health down to the high age .
over 20 percent of the population at age 65 to 74 years of dental sur@@ pl@@ essness affects THE DA@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dentistry .
the new long @-@ term study sub@@ missions the findings .

European Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over the TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic Trade Agreement TTIP , the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to its way clearly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bri@@ din has recently launched the proposal as a European negotiating position in the United States .
the German government announced support .
in TTIP , the largest free trade area in the world is supposed to rise to 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings cont@@ end in fact that the EU and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment programme .
they should come to the same parts of the EU , the US and from third countries .
it is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to lift up against jud@@ g@@ ments .
hitherto the procedures involved with each other on refer@@ ee , a objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , I have become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and fairness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own information on an International Investment Court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified .
the investor @-@ state arbitration cases above all demanded from large @-@ level @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional Ar@@ bit@@ ration are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism by the companies suspect to damage their tax@@ payers , national laws ex@@ al@@ cul@@ ate or reducing consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements ( Anti @-@ TTIP @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations such as Camp@@ act ) proposed proposals by the European Commission as insufficient .

off@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is on the stage in the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy red Fol@@ ks@@ än@@ ger recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with fil@@ es@@ sti@@ ff .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by Stev@@ ens talk .
he tells the story of different places he records on the map again and report his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender songs .
where they were created and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , Mr. Stev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative mani@@ ac .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appear cle@@ ated songs that are p@@ aving in harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American Folk of the late 1960s , but at any time in the best opul@@ ent dri@@ fts . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but even in 2004 and in Rhein@@ dah@@ el , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and breaks up positive expectations .
Stev@@ ens takes to be reduced here .
live enough him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later he returns to the series in New York , New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Chicago &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ le@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears in 2005 an extensive masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ ord@@ ingly in ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American bili@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , Stev@@ ens applied to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( 2010 ) with extensive electronic pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here , become the colourful spectacle from Ne@@ on @-@ forehead @-@ legs and large fluor@@ es@@ cing staging stage .

without putting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play through the wide @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and one could throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jeremy Cor@@ bi@@ ns Debut on the appointment of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns made his debut in the prime minister of Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour chairman Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is his debut in the Prime Minister for the Prime Minister and to create himself with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n will rise to noon for the first of his six @-@ time issues , while his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from Ukraine .
he asked for &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he can be ski@@ pped some sessions to leave his colleagues .
this meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s leadership since it was appointed to a member of the shadow of the shadow , and after his speech at TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the Labour president , on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ote has prov@@ oked at a memorial service for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several title @-@ site stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Decision , not to sing the n@@ hy@@ m@@ ote , has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said he had been &quot; in dis@@ respectful silence &quot; and he had recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he urged the Labour Party to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ote , &quot; independently , &quot; by his belief that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of shadows have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s peak , and they are called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one @-@ sixth of the parliament@@ arians were originally supported as leaders .
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences will also be st@@ ack@@ able within the Labour Party and by Mr Cor@@ bi@@ ns comments on the position of the European Union and the limit of winning .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour wants to take place in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later , Mr Smith , who has a shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister , that the party &quot; was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ at 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n will be the fifth Labour president , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , has over the last decade across the Disp@@ atch Box in the parliament .
the Labour president , who promised another policy approach , says he has given &quot; Crow@@ ning &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister has to confront , and that he is under threat with resistance and breaking down the dispute with resistance and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n said that Angela Eagle , his shadow guest minister is represented in him , if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
he also got the idea into conversation , that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the apartment , I addressed to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became the leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron spoke that he wants to engage in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who is often linked with the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister . however , a few years later he acknowledged it failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the fra@@ gment with the Prime Minister was seen as a major bar@@ ometer of the judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics did have argued that she had become a caric@@ ature and im@@ measur@@ ably reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose un@@ wi@@ ped according to data , showing a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE was increased 100 by the D@@ BM@@ iller an objective .
between May and July the result was increased , without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2,@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this figure was the fastest ever since 2009 and was estimated at the time of a rate of interest .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar at $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was crus@@ hed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to 1.@@ 44@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed by an increase by 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a leap from 20 % after the take @-@ offer of the Rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and brands like Bud@@ ck@@ wise , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch gather together .
Bur@@ berry shares were encouraging in encouraging messages from the competition for luxury goods cast@@ chem@@ ist 0.@@ 9 % higher .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts brand recent sales numbers hit all expectations and demonstrated also that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth .
shares of Glen@@ core came by 5 % after the mining giant said that he had 2.5 billion $ by a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and with a decrease of 4.2 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his estimate for the company R@@ ating to sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sports@@ wear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger our expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power will be the higher labour @-@ power at his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that might mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

potatoes or don@@ er ?

inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; from D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ hay Kar@@ to@@ ir and meat combined to a sp@@ ar .
the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; which he had seen by chance on television .
since then there has been a barbecue in his shop , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea adopted by the Government of the Government in Munich ( German ) in Munich .
there , according to the Authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the sp@@ it contains , Al@@ hay therefore does not want to reveal .
only so much : &quot; it tasted together even better , &quot; he finds .

Met@@ cash launches bottom @-@ level campaign to combat fraud
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a high @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia beginning next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarket their relationship with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream media and marketing via social media via events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers advance on board , with brands such as ice producers of S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops rehear@@ s@@ als and shop owners , who withdraw tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected to publish other details of his defence policy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler , for food , alcohol and devices conduc@@ ts its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; Day .
there is much stake in the game since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A @-@ shop and higher profits as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Ig@@ A network in the eastern states .
local Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically infected and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared with around 14 per cent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of its first markets , some five percent of the food market will be cut away in these two states and will take away all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
a report published this week according to the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million sales revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will be losing $ by the end of 2016 .
this prognosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate annual sales of 500 million $ and 600 million dollars in each market .
the loss in food and food business and with amounts on met@@ a @-@ high fixed @-@ base could cost met@@ cash approximately 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , met@@ adata market shares in the East states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent past survey conducted by Roy Morgan was found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s turnover in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , and 2,@@ 1 per cent in 2018 , will reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has added contact .
from 2010 onwards , IG@@ As Market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food outlets , which has about 1,@@ 200 percent since 2012 , is due to its operative reduction of debt reduction in sales and margins .
the big wholes@@ al@@ ers dri@@ lls and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to produce sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ on@@ ths to produce hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A retailers can supply to improve their shops thanks to rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and loading programmes to El@@ an increase and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to gain growth .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by the president of the Australian Bar Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ o Co@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; Col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Sim@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ te@@ akis , the younger brother Eric Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; induced by the in@@ famous debate of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in Cincinnati joined , Co@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ryan Harrison will need to be separated by the arbitr@@ ators , taking Harrison and called to propose gest@@ gios . I was supposed to beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how to rent a tennis rac@@ quet , after a cr@@ amp failed to win a potential US Open @-@ victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ te@@ akis was ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in front of Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals on Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I put up rather light , is the fact that after my view than@@ asi a little was caught up into the dispute , He@@ aly said .
he has broken a thu@@ gs because he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat from frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ ate good enough to know that he is not proud of that .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he was dealt with a little too high .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he was trained in the locker room , he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into account the decision that enforced on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all but it secur@@ es the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the contest and not on all the controversi@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick has done very quickly for what people like the Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray had pointed out . he returns to the public eye and he deserves some bad mistakes and he deserves to give him the consequences of his action . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declares Emer@@ gency shelter , closed the border , stops refugees
Hungary explains the emergency and st@@ acked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants responded to indign@@ ation at a no @-@ man &apos;s land and Serbian government officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who were f@@ lown out of violence for an un@@ familiar time in a land@@ strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
when a police helicopter above them web@@ fed them , the immigrants &quot; Op@@ eth the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against Hungarian deployment .
some were taken from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary towards more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a poster to harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turmoil in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nations @-@ block in Brussels was not able to agree a common asylum policy at a deb@@ ating meeting in Brussels .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought to prevail over Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be achieved that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday for a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Hungary continued his hopes not to return soon to Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government headed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more power to cope with the crisis so they could block roads and must speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also im@@ poses the construction of a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison races have been deployed in the competition , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant margin from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East at a significant Eng@@ age and entry into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most economic migrants are in search of a better life and not refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary give the crossing of border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence with us that the government headed along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher sti@@ pen@@ alties for condemned merchants .
&quot; because of the situation formed by the mass migration , the Hungarian government compl@@ ying the state of state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still approve the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but journalists from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs already in days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advisor for Or@@ ban said that authorities spend 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penetr@@ ated deeper into the country .
they come from by killing the fence , they are now in police officers , and are accused of hearing of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are here to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train ra@@ gon was bar@@ ed with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the major border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and thrust a crowd to get involved .
approximately 20 managed to come up , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connections between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead mostly absorbed by Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the ground to the ground .
Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders stood second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den who has not yet proclaimed whether he is responsible for the Presidential Administration , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the vote .
more than five months before beginning elections , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion stands or what candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ ically supporters are more durable in their choice than those of other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ BS scored many profits .
Clinton keeps a big head with women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have reduced itself .
their support in the men has declined significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage with democratic voters in the age of 50 has van@@ ished , and they are of equal height at the same height .
Clinton had a big head start with the older voters .
last month , Clinton had been against a two @-@ point lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections say nationwide that they would support us with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one fourth would support them with some pre@@ dation , and another 15 percent would only assist them because they are the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ically current supporters are especially thrilled about it .
the views are stronger , with those who currently not support Clinton - only about a quarter would it thri@@ ve .
while 48 per cent of democratic voters want to say that Clinton concluded with enthusiasm , less republi@@ can voters say so through their peak edge @-@ data Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ically supports it in an open question why they want it to be the candidate &apos;s most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman chairman is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
as mentioned by Clin@@ ically support , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
consent to dealing with the problems and voters are also quoted .
since the Vice President raises the potential for the Office of the Office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race , although one third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who for the party would be their second choice is Bi@@ den at the helm .
from Clin@@ ically &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of us .
decide to be@@ g Bi@@ den , not for the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t &apos;s edge takes off S@@ anders , of 20 points with bees in the race for 30 points without him in the race .
twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has declined from 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that he sees it as the &quot; dial &apos; has risen .
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important when a candidate is more important , Democratic Party asks a question of voters .
similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for these voters of the election will be unacceptable as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates show good results in certain important characteristics with voters the pres@@ election of their party .
there are multi @-@ truths Clinton , Sax@@ on and be@@ k as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts at the three candidates best in honesty , whilst Clin@@ ically &apos;s strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say the above S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinion of him .
democratic voters of the elections certainly see Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements something about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have any opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions concerning Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server will continue to be called foreign affairs , most Democratic voters are pleased with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions are not influenced in total .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is content .
the public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem of light arrived .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated .
these are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 people who say their views from Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy it is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to the elections also see truste@@ e than not honest and cannot be trusted .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are given good banknotes in leadership .
of the six tested candidates make Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honesty .
a majority regards sooner rather than honest , but like Car@@ son , many do not have any opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is on a nationwide survey of Donald Tru@@ mp .
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates have lost half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and they will lose more dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide programmes in a large number . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted in front of the Fox News debate during the last month , around 27 % in the survey held on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son sch@@ oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and Tru@@ mp is made with Republi@@ can constitu@@ ents with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ early Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ himself , who died at the deepest Scott Walker , who is at the deepest , with 10 % support last month at the age of 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Governor J@@ eb Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third place .
the debu@@ gger at the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - he lands at 19 % assistance with the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey done by ABC News / Washington Post also showed mit@@ mp in front of Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the last week of rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp took some side @-@ time for the former neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on the last Saturday while a campaign of campaigns in Iowa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bath@@ tu@@ bers there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find a warm water .
a bath in North or Baltic sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some are no longer going into the sea : max . 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic sea during this week , shares the German Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
in the other hand , bathing temperatures continues to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes down to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ newcom@@ ers
nearly two years after a student died during a mobile ritual for a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder , will be submitted to five persons .
members of New York Bar@@ uch college P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i Delta PSI leaders attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory meeting in September 2013 and hes@@ it@@ ant his transport to the hospital , leading to his death , shared the police with him .
officials spoke that he had been bur@@ dened with attached eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated , while he tried to go over a frozen field on one goal .
Mr. Den@@ g ultimately said about head@@ ache , then he fell apart .
the members of the P@@ i Delta PSI leaders not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was powerless , and waited a single hour before putting it into a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to switch to D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gle his symptoms to goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , President Mar@@ sig@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and set the good of the Brotherhood , basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Political Gro@@ ef , Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning at his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ tic report , Den@@ g were repeated with st@@ ump@@ tion power injuries to head , torso and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ ps of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Schi@@ kan@@ en &quot; in 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ S family represents , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable and this step from public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e advised an indictment for murder of third persons for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with serious attacks and forming a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - this sanc@@ tioned - so we will also hold them accountable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a raise increase will come , and the house will fall out , ren@@ ding for bonds will rise , and the economy will be dra@@ gging in a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little instruction to the sequence .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so heavily that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could realize that the whole excitement was eventually exaggerated because of a zinc increase .
&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the &apos; cheap money &apos; , Julian Jes@@ en@@ p , Che@@ k@@ co at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
by contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to have the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends - looking at how some areas of the economy might respond :
as seen in the last month &apos;s market , the for@@ er@@ ation of zinc increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase in the increase , the influence is not that dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to be explored from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after a interest rate of F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is generally up@@ lifting in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on its way to a zinc increase , fairly flat in the last six days ( average profit from 2.@@ 6 percent ) , then back to the average yield in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to an actual analysis , Bob D@@ oll , head system strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published by Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the In@@ cre@@ al cycle and return the return to l@@ essen .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic activity , but interest rates are raising them often .
in the current case , F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and could speed up a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the Gross Dom@@ estic Product will be close to its lowest point at a zinc increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rates since 1950 was only twice nominal GDP under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expect that this will last and expect to be only 1.5 percent for the third quarter from Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such an fragile economic environment could be risky and ask the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have agreed on a round increase of F@@ ed , and all eyes were set at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ MC might have an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading could only be a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study all increases cycles of 1950 to date in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on rec@@ essions very quickly put after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
contrary to that , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the watched phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has waited since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months now .
the firm income was also volati@@ le since the market receives a capital increase , and the pattern is fairly similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than shares , when changing their strategic course .
with bonds the rendering seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / reduction in the cycle is performed .
at the end of the booster cycle the bond problems dropped immediately , said the German bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase will lead to the interest rates well , that Ren@@ ate between longer and shorter bonds will bring closer and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
high @-@ performance bonds often bring better income in such a climate although , &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ sing at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting , says Jones , that markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the income is fl@@ atter , mark@@ ups have increased and the volati@@ lity increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large and all over the world , businesses that benefit the larger share of their operations in the United States will benefit , if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are being less da@@ unting because a rising dollar is making its products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react highly positively three months after initial Zin@@ ser@@ increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with increased balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
company with high capital ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also imp@@ lied their counterparts of lower quality by average ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of pure stock , consumers will also benefit by increasing dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are different opinions how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Commander @-@ member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distor@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its .
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle the broadcast The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leader member and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something the private station does not do .
the conservative de@@ MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ law radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; was &quot; dum@@ me &quot; and increasingly don &apos;t be distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards , which began last December .
the BBC Music Awards that launched last year , The Br@@ its appear to be only under a different name .
so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already in the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General showed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competition when it comes to live music and clarification .
what I &apos;m going to learn from Radio 3 I will like to learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music making it really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to order new works , I really consider it &apos;s important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that harder to work harder to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
yet Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for this led by fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice to - the musical talent at the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see one of why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; produced on special BBC way . &quot;
he added , he wishes that the company will &quot; find &quot; a hit out of our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when the next time it started a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give away money from the other payers for other entertainment formats .
Internet connection climbed in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this purpose .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online selling .
last month the lowest result existed since the beginning of the records in 2000
online @-@ sales increased slightly three years ago by using phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has stopped their expenses
for over a decade , the virtual machine has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned to Ge@@ ister@@ en .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online conver@@ sions are stag@@ nating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August had the lowest increases in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ nating , after making new figures only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and going back to 2000 it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales as Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that the online @-@ sales were increased three years ago , as a buyer ( starting with their mobile phones ) .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , Z. B. at home on the couch .
but now this one com@@ utes itself , and we will possibly experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which has been imported from America is cited as a reason for the slow@@ ing revenue .
experts believe that buyer with@@ hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , which is held last Friday in November .
last year there were five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and several dealers sites collap@@ sed .
experts believe that Black Friday where the Bu@@ yers are fighting for bar@@ gain , buyers who could hold off their purchases .
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that 5 £ spending has been issued a little more than 1 £ online .
some products such as television and washing machines are now done over a third of the purchases over web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead in the pre@@ placement in the urban cities .
Muslims buried in Mecca in the crane @-@ accident - bin Laden &apos;s family becomes sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets
Saudi @-@ Arabia considering the collapse of some of the huge Sau@@ dic Bin Laden group .
the healthcare Ministry said that a total of 3@@ 94 people have been wounded after the crane threw
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the killed that were killed , as a crane to Mek@@ ong W@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
sad filled , widely dressed , the track in order to declare her respect , when the first of the dead came to Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m cemetery .
the funer@@ al proc@@ ession went over at the Holy Sites , where only days before , a tree grows through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying stor@@ eys .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the bin Laden , because of the catastrophe , which left hand at 31.@@ 94 .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 beats that were killed , as a crane through the Great Central mo@@ or@@ ee Mek@@ kas collap@@ sed , were carried by the streets .
among the dead there was q@@ al@@ m Ak@@ ram made out of Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane over@@ threw .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Ha@@ j@@ j in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi agencies have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to Mecca by thousands who will continue to come into town .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group had not left the arm of the sick , when he was not used .
a Arabic version of decree was published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden was also responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the message agency reported this detail did not tell , however , that the company &apos;s leadership will be banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man transferred to revealing what caused the overthrow of the crane , which collap@@ sed to a courtyard of the Grand mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims occurred before the H@@ add@@ sch that later this month gathered .
I did not mention any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal De@@ ar also bl@@ aded the group because of no current security measures and because it was not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cur@@ riculum , surrounded by Mek@@ ong W@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project , which is led by the Bin Laden group .
the bin Laden has been connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over greater construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden was a descend@@ ant son who was dispos@@ s@@ essed of the family in the 1990 @-@ 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in middle strong winds and rain , only few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials spoke that 15@@ 8 people were in hospital .
government officials assume that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to the members of the fat@@ alities are to be paid and the equal amount of permanently injured .
the last will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is saying that the time of cheap European crafts@@ man is over
British employ more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled crafts@@ man from Eastern Europe has a rise
this leads to that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q best@@ os will fall nationwide in the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city Chief @-@ correspon@@ dent the Daily Mail
it is argued that British are fighting their h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes for the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home .
if you can sk@@ ate with a hammer or a brush to con@@ gestion walls , you now belong to a minority .
for British are increasingly occupied craftsmen to carry home jobs in their homes , so the manager of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , a new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the farmer chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices may be over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to arti@@ sans and close 60 selling points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
at the moment the men prevail over men .
she said it was necessary to adjust to the growing demographic trends that have more female single households which carry more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to shift this stronger way into a balance .
basically , half of our customers are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has undertaken her top team , in order to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies almost 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial status .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - this is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ fis@@ her fro@@ sted a decline in the half @-@ year win and the cont@@ est@@ ments after the group owes the costs for the left of the stores .
king@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the court
on Wednesday the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt have on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ register A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ credit ring .
the defend@@ ants do not know himself guilty .
one of them had also been indicted for abuse of authority .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted of law in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the National @-@ State Management Board , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ examined that the defend@@ ants were used in 2006 to 2011 money from club accounts that they were used to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage occurred at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports@@ men are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact divided the chairman of the op@@ ener , Ri@@ chter@@ in Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the re@@ pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense represents that the association was not included in an asset .
the sports function would have been calculated only expenses and the sport club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , from the debt records in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 s@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we were standing before the situation : do we continue to manage the club or lock ourselves up ? &quot; he told one of the defend@@ ants , in Br@@ ot@@ ok@@ f big business audi@@ tor of the financial system .
then he decided to take on this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have prescribed money , which is laid down in the bank as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association was agreed : you can manage the money free , it just may not be made debt .
furthermore , - in terms of the financial - success the payout of the exp@@ ir@@ ations was retro@@ spec@@ tively determined by 1991 .
therefore , I have noticed a part of the exp@@ ir@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus in the account was , paid off .
therefore , also l@@ ump @-@ sum and non @-@ detail compounds , explained the former Ob@@ mann of the processes .
the accounts and audi@@ ted books presented the two defend@@ ants together , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the withdrawal deposits have not been detailed in detail then asked the judge .
the association was not interested in the detail of finance , important to the debt of debt , so the answer is .
as in the year 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros began to be transferred to the club account , a amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account .
that would have been hind@@ ran@@ ces , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran into the name of the second defend@@ ants and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent knew long no answer .
then he said , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have awakened something of that money , the pro@@ secutor made in the room .
the co @-@ accused would have been informed , justify the function of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; flood . &quot;
why claims in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know ri@@ cher and pro@@ secutor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that this phrase had not been agreed because the association had never caused any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom are you all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked .
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never covered a cent content , he only reck@@ oned o@@ dom@@ eter and diets .
on diets he charged the association 1,000 Euros per month , but the actual cost has been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the defend@@ ants .
these are according to a test , in which everything was assessed as correctly , no longer kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second defend@@ ant based .
all Beh@@ eb@@ les are in cash , for this he must go from his residence of the International Market to the Char@@ ge to St@@ ay , stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September by the question@@ ing of witnesses .

time , decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world has been observed if the U.S. d@@ ash@@ bank will come together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade that interest rates are raised .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists asked by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that F@@ ed would do so , now think the F@@ ed will keep somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates down to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may stop the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising the interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is at a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ ast@@ ute view of global circumstances .
she warned the markets to make an increase , but the signs suggest that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20 : 00 CET on Thursday
death ar@@ cher on the Delta State University left apologi@@ zing for the c@@ itation
after the shooting and killing his girlfriend on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleague and killed Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he &apos;s &quot; pity &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it in@@ done , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer in geography and social scientific education at the Delta State University , calling emergency number from 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot to someone , and killed someone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the staff of the staff to send police officers to their home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house is , but he will &quot; no man be bothered , &quot; but probably be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police occurred the scene they found the body of Amy P@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could revers@@ ed it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he wi@@ ped nothing from a conflict between Lenin and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the event supposedly claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &apos;s no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trinity relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but did friends .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss your daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement from Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les , that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of p@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , has been met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said I was called to a certain moment on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t go into the prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen took him on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , drove his car to the side , escape to walking , ran into the woods and killed itself with a shot .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly , because of the dou@@ bl@@ acks
Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League &apos;s defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven a dual carriage of his right B@@ one .
while this holds the left margin for top quality and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the court and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bump@@ y and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then I can operate in Manchester
it is terrible - a boy who gets to Manchester United with the age of 18 , it is very heavy and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mas@@ ke .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a dual carriage , then it takes six months and he won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed lucky to be a Red Card and the suspension of a mo@@ an .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alize the Mexic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself whenever I say that a ver@@ meter and a red card was required .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I will come back more quickly . &quot;
her@@ on related to Manchester United I suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat of the PS@@ V
the European Championship has an added incentive in France to recover from the European Championship in France up to the next June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about that .
it never is the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a bein@@ g@@ ation when Mexico played at the World Championship team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V players Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - by a scar@@ f by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is doing The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost mem@@ orization .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the prime minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 founded environmental len@@ ght of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , for it seems always to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead publish a variation of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details added to the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy called Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to full@@ fill out the girl of his dreams , it reads . a love @-@ interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ el@@ ated and who died in 1991 , however , is completely unknown .
as if this is not suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is sometimes written like the abstract of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes to become a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams .
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ mati@@ cal father , it seems unlikely to Cameron is the action of the book as little familiar . here , an in@@ put@@ ted boy , like the local environment through the c@@ ash@@ ore , trees @-@ flo@@ wering , Th@@ rou@@ gh@@ o@@ bear@@ ers , &quot; who speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; desol@@ ate .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax about 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street @-@ Spe@@ aker said that the text probably came from Camer@@ ato &apos;s franchise office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text by Mr Cameron was delivered , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England , but it is still hard
to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , it is a difficult task , but considering the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not shut out an out@@ stri@@ fe .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in bat@@ ting up , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
the ball developed mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an un@@ familiar size on test plane , is an option for the attack .
in this regard , Adam Ly@@ eth returns from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult circumstances , and the simple but harsh reality is that crime players are oriented to results .
there were no question mark by Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best performers .
a long time ago the running of Ly@@ eth was extended , but he had control of its own fate .
if he hope further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not bring so good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time is a test @-@ guard to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ eth got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and get ahead .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first appeared in the Caribbean before Jonathan - when Ly@@ th was in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a percussion I highly regard .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he had 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which made us very hit .
he must have at least the same chances as the one before him but this depends of course on the role of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to get Mozart next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and would get four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can not beat there , and these left @-@ handed have already shown that he &apos;s a Teu@@ fel@@ ic@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket player .
Mor@@ een maybe did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he immediately made three hundred cents and was not looking back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup chips that raise their hands and the coach have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
aside from the team England has made a few smart additions in the trainers .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ u@@ ine , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who has a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful approach to the Setup .
I always felt that he &apos;s designed for international cri@@ cket tournaments , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can be fresh in the locker room , even though the messages are in harmony with the previous ones .
col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate with Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part I had no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members determine not the schedule .
and you need to remember that with players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit Camp@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to the influ@@ encing when the economy takes place in a coat ...
David Cameron &apos;s re@@ fra@@ grant strategy to keep Britain deep into trouble with every single day , even without choosing the in@@ geni@@ ous word &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for leaders of Labour and TU@@ C , who dis@@ cer@@ ally v@@ agu@@ ed themselves on Tuesday on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ bi@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Col@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at openly told us that some member states , so deeply moved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from our own debt , Britain itself set an agenda with spec@@ kled concessions and disturbing contracting changes , which they mostly don &apos;t want .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that they may not je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se their social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie Agenda .
prime minister and finance minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior of the EU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and we have seen more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are or going . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s vigil@@ ant reg@@ istrar Angela Merkel is an allies , but it has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as it is for the exaggerated long @-@ har@@ ms like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland has soon become a nationalist government , Spain with a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , perhaps some such ministers may even dis@@ su@@ ally no helpful comment , totally in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ endu@@ p surgery to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process as well as my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ ad and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t won anything of the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how common the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one , as they did , during the period of Tony Ben@@ n inspired by August 1975 but did not exist , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can also remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportunity , who made a name for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his mani@@ ac , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sc@@ iss@@ ors , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing aliens and the pseudo @-@ German states that have most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Blair looks similar to her , but noted that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having to have lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ers than Blair itself , as he had responded to the adopted referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle passed by the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened up a door @-@ door .
the press has never left him again .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on the back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he couldn &apos;t take any time for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ sc@@ ott Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake back then and now .
it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ bi@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I want to be friendly - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ utri@@ ent tendency and the wil@@ dered sil@@ houette of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well tell everyone about them .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the Radio and on TV this week said not to admit that Cor@@ bi@@ ano &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a prime minister .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ party , as his old father sought to be in television , loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; to stay &quot; under all circumstances - Ben@@ ns term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and Members to all reports on their Kl@@ aus@@ al Day on Monday .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n seeks - think that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline stays important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct , Cameron does not give a free card for Europe that allowed him to keep lab@@ ours support in the campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scar@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign for a matter of course , how Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins ke@@ ep@@ eth sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ bi@@ ns fundamental multi @-@ deu@@ ces with EU membership - in line with its ben@@ n@@ ite si@@ ege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ c@@ issu@@ ance of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities - Tom Wat@@ son is uns@@ ha@@ kable that J@@ C does not start a campaign to outlet , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why do Paris or Berlin squ@@ ander in political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be meaning@@ less ?
the U.S. is already rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with an estimate of the T@@ ory government in power which I was reminded at the start of Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
asser@@ tions of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was made up of a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by adopting the Public Health England ( phic ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; morph@@ ing released the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; report in the last month , describing it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however some researchers have questioned the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and re@@ directed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal The Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y foundation , &quot; in the prime minister founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have wondered whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving the effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said the public is expecting that the announcement of cons@@ ular that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of retro@@ wise and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people , who have been called to develop a model for a multi @-@ assessment document analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages of various nicotine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose manager was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to obtain funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they received after reports prior to by the tobacco company Philip Morris International they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ be are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes units , some of which also include a variety of industries financing in the paper .
several other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of the United States participated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indicates that there is a shortage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the phic report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of morph@@ ing that &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes were only a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being with phe , said that BM@@ C has already been re@@ acted to the asser@@ tions of BM@@ J .
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to this are small but that we continue to study the long term effects .
in other words , the unique obligation to inform the public about what is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative danger related to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0.000 people die yearly from a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion £ per year .
by clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without any risks , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , says the former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the Broadcasting position should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller public to place in hard @-@ controversial time@@ pieces against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and broad@@ casts like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company to join more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs should be on behalf of , or sends it clearly displayed by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to hold the broad@@ casting fee , which means that I do not think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production on programs that others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a first time window , because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous ; it &apos;s natural nonsense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another one , admittedly , both self productions .
honestly , other channels would give your right arm for that .
I am happy to see how this should be publicly available TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would decrease the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business for series , the Channel 4 out from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give it again , which is the former HEAD of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ equ@@ ine speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows how to sell the East@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal limb@@ o programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfil their duties and they can argue when they go to their proj@@ ections for the justification of 4 billion £ circuit tuition , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all of these ob@@ sc@@ ure programmes that no one has seen . &quot;
they place it in a window in which no one ever wanted to see it .
to the broadcast@@ er , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more regulated system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course , you all think that you &apos;ll get a great deal for 150 £ a year here , but for folks who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me whether this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form and entertain . &quot;
he said , only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example in the open @-@ related television channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , &quot; inform and entertain . &quot;
on the matter of partnerships El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television could be shown , and with the commercial programs alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ ases &apos; can control bra@@ in@@ ic by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with Klang@@ impul@@ sen .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by bro@@ o@@ ds of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they are occupied with sound impul@@ sive , which have been heard for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard .
the stimul@@ i work by the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels which respond to ultras@@ ound .
further on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called son@@ o@@ esters , which can be used by ultras@@ ound in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of neur@@ ons , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
flu@@ kes are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the increased ultras@@ ound @-@ waves are called on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onian channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the lit@@ ters .
sound @-@ waves bring up the opening of these icons and activate the cells , which they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create an ultras@@ ound Nem@@ ato@@ den , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the thro@@ ws so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ists bear TR@@ P @-@ 4 star channels .
when he employs ultr@@ asonic on the changed creatures , the sound@@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bes , and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ ons .
the process has some similarities with op@@ to@@ ases , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to capture and eliminate neur@@ ons with impulse of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ ases could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , can le@@ ash ultras@@ ound waves can happen , and so can be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the ab@@ used human neur@@ ons temporarily prone to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin production cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and the Carto@@ on images leave no doubt that this ad was produced for the world &apos;s biggest weapon show , to bring the willingness of the British government to enter into the lim@@ elight , weapons to re@@ pressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamaica in the Excel Centre in London Do@@ ck@@ lands .

V@@ C@@ CP certified by Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which prevailed around the advertising for its arsen@@ al - by a lead of the Excel calendar and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign which they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a realistic and eli@@ ver@@ ty company acquisition , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains more powerful . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture units on the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .

eight golden rules for living in student residence
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism as well , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ minded complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance of one student dormit@@ ories varies from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell wh@@ ence you are coming , whether you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a fi@@ ery extract ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it turns the conversation and helps you to find the people who like you in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes would cast in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let human beings .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people prefer to attract and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
in relation to this , do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ine obtained a rough handling at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space @-@ to @-@ space tri@@ um@@ mel culture which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to relax .
nothing within the culture permits you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away , so that I can get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comb@@ at@@ one is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of knock .
speaking of anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ absorbed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship connect by b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of folks to imagine , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ he year , welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve b@@ bed you something . so , and now please smile , if I give you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a great way to make friend@@ ships .
her room@@ mate feel obliged to entertain yourself and will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
naturally this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make it possible for people to get sle@@ ep@@ y when they anchor .
food to steal , is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the h@@ ull of chicken is a theft , but is it taking the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check the one with the dairy owners .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the inside .
when someone ste@@ als your things is the up@@ setting , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it , as my room@@ mate she added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , the people from sleep , or from work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb says to the people who sit in the Glass House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl on my hallway asked her neighbours , if it makes them a bit easier to turn for Drum &amp; bass some qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
you re@@ acted with even less music .
when they finally heard at 5 p.m. , she kindly allowed her to sleep two hours before she checked her own music , closed her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic , if your future spouse would happen to move into the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be terri@@ bly dist@@ res@@ sing when you hold a room@@ mate for your future wife , who will have to go back and then experience it every day and maybe experience how they bring all my friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own path - but if a hot co@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk to your spouse a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has his keys in his not included room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying are f@@ eins , than it seems .
a good place is fun , but it only takes moments when it is to bo@@ omer@@ ang .
put through ent@@ ail a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but do not miss somebody &apos;s rooms with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door , and place their keys in a glass of water that you then place in the freezer - but bur@@ sting their domini@@ ons at the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ rac@@ ed houses for refugees , non @-@ extrac@@ tive , Ger@@ ing@@ earned
the property contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the mid @-@ Frank@@ ly rac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but just as the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ bred &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show how one can today build affordable and well @-@ favorable , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview
thousands of refugees are pushing for the apartment market .
the entrepreneur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing is being created : it builds on a project in semi @-@ detached houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass @-@ class accommodation in containers or sne@@ aks has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in the face of the refugee stream , we need plenty of living space for the next few decades .
a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed row is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a row House needs a least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if people sub@@ mits to people living in residential blocks .
each of the six houses , which are built straight in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living room and is located in 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is manage@@ able .
six months the construction took me .
this is appropriate .
are the construction regulations imposed on their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have carried out my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
special complicated it always makes the suff@@ oc@@ ating Dam@@ ov@@ kl@@ shi@@ par exceptional and the lock@@ space order .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still underlined , who creates three apartments in a row house , takes at least three pitches .
only in the cities lack the space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants re@@ acting to their ter@@ rac@@ ed home project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have sent me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luxury hotels for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely will not be wrong .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it is true : in the last five years we have seen a construction boom in Germany , but it &apos;s built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees but also the only mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ earned .
I am showing how to build and well on the present day .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS , if Apple @-@ Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking on the set @-@ up app , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typ@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are encountered after the installation on issues , as they get an error message , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users is advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely through the cycle of the update . likewise , it will be simpler to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then restart it when the process is complete .
it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged while updating or situated near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may un@@ folded up half @-@ way and lead it to a de@@ tract of updates .

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
Nico Ros@@ berg in the battle for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton just still has a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Summit stressed that I lost nothing more before the start into the crucial seven overseas &apos; race , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I won &apos;t lose anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

2009 and last year the race was won over the next 30 years .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state has an influence on the Great Prize of Singapore is still unclear .

bathroom Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the &apos; Schach@@ club &apos; Chess club &apos; was founded three months ago , has recorded another member in his ranks , so the membership figures rose to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a keen chess player and tennis player who entertained himself more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bearer of the national representative 1st class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players that do not charge the member fee .
youth work and talent look should also be promoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the club and also has friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ white &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an expression of its connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office looks for direct contact
S@@ alu@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Fund and opened a new place at the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
besides deliber@@ ations , one can also take part in courses .
the inc@@ it@@ ement draws it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently been a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office .
here , directly next to the shopping market , we immediately receive Sen@@ iors and Ad@@ vice Information on questions such as care insurance or the health insurance coverage .
for years we have been firmly committed to our ambul@@ ance care service , that often nursing associates will be left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; even if the complexity of the insur@@ ances are not yet avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insur@@ ances will not be understood , &quot; explained the new landlord in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and who is responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
besides consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office offers also the prevention , health care and wellness .
in this end the S@@ alu@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as storm @-@ prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the senior center and the S@@ alu@@ dis are complement each other in an ideal way .
S@@ alu@@ dis is for prevention , prevention and Reh@@ a .
&quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; illustrated Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Head of S@@ alu@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new neighbour@@ hoods to the inner city see both business leaders in the demographic change .

in Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but the consequences for the unusual incident has not yet been clear .
the thing is still in the trial , &quot; it is called the city of Bremen .
only then I decided whether meadow is shown , or not .

witnesses seeks the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ oral : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in direction Sal@@ oral .
one of the group , a 17 years old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police and his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to see that they might be waiting for him .
at this time , the group was at the height of the ft @-@ gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons on .
one of these men now cried the youth and struck this with their fist to face .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ cken and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends killed and presented on the bats , this first led by his sacrifice .
from his friends the injured young man has now been brought home .
the offen@@ ders followed the group with a car up to the apartment and ran over several times there .
when one could no longer saw the vehicle , the last one was in front of the building in order to smoke a cigarette smoking .
there he was re @-@ attacked by the bat and another male individual .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Sam@@ t@@ shared Grand@@ master Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ ff Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller to shoulder the practice of Fel@@ ber &apos;s ausen on the 1st of October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor is still standing at the side in the coming months .
after a re@@ construction phase , Müller again opens the practice on October 12 , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro into the premises at the St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight , when the rock faces met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ ated , who currently graduated in medical education at the Wei@@ dener Hospital and will continue into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the troubles would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber &apos;s breaks and laughing .
&quot; when it was so far I was simply called . &quot;
the couple Müller ar@@ mb@@ led the idea to continue to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he can soon be his own boss .
and so one was agreed , the troubles lo@@ on offer the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up in his medical studies in Hanover , followed in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a primary consultant in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed Chief of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is engaged as a volunteer at DR@@ K @-@ Read@@ fr@@ o @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ber , works as a primary care physician , his spouse has specialized in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ten , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ ts .
after the conversion , the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ pay@@ lines and need a microphone .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro will receive the Mü@@ llers as part of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is carried on , &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ shared master Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Mu@@ eller G@@ ong@@ ation every quarter comes into practice Fel@@ ber &apos;s breaks , in the North German average practice , it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor would have found it , it would have gone .
he who visits Müller &apos;s watches , is by the way also still looking at familiar faces : assumes the seven medical experts and the cleaning force of the field sit@@ ing .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ber @-@ ir@@ oning .
a little sad@@ ness had gotten her after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband t@@ opped up : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed ahead of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and besides , the pair has two grandchildren and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also high on our border border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to achieve a asylum application , it can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of men is at the forefront .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , not of the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia contem@@ pl@@ ating &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel to Austria and Germany to continue the refugees in direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances want cor@@ ridors for refugees .
in this way , the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach certainly did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Slovenia will rather monitor the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary - to intensify . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border with Croatia is already much controlled as an out@@ border to the Schengen area .
as the Minister in emphas@@ ised , Slovenia has to cope with its limits for refugees but not abri@@ ol@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the evening hours on Tuesday to pass on in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to recover the registration .
the Croatian police could hold on it in the nearby ma@@ iz@@ fields .
according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days his country with some 4,000 refugees , said the Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
furthermore , buses from pressing on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border that has so far brought to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that she would allow people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either we can , nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day another buses would expect .
across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants have been on the road all night of the approximately 500 kilometres of distant Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police have told us that we should come here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus , it is now possible that the shift of the previous Balkan R@@ Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia was to come to a slightly further west direction of the previous Balkan R@@ ange in Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stated that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible work@@ flow for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has complete opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you lead strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU partners since 2007 has consistently been a positive testimony as regards the standard of border controls .
on ser@@ ky side , there are about 300 refugees left behind the Hungarian border @-@ fence .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der Medien@@ report they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two limits of Hor@@ gos and back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is not yet unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm mid @-@ morning at a local remind in Hor@@ gos : he will hold the debates about alternative courses of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not happen at present to be very high refugee numbers .
one could not say if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
Hel@@ per among migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute the country &apos;s refugees on which alternative routes are shown through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there is still no cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police had announced that a de@@ mining team was sent to the border region .
market h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminal , who has been dis@@ car@@ ded to have gained an insight into un@@ released financial statements and press releases to websites such as Business wire , marketing and PR news@@ wire .

in this way , investig@@ ators were projected to talk a total of over 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately trapped &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says in the S@@ EC Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other accus@@ ations made in the case di@@ gest@@ ed .
most of the defend@@ ants came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are meant to be active in both the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ arian has attracted attention with this action on its 20 year anniversary and is quite closely confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it is about life , that is why we went through the midst of the action in the midst of the city and among men , &quot; Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer says .
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ arian is exclusively for questions and discussions at its disposal as the volunteers .
while man@@ ch takes up spontane@@ ously to the chal@@ k , and then read the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; can &quot; read &quot; with the camper by the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; they say , &quot; as far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
over and over and over again , there are little discussions on the action themselves , about life , dealing with the dying .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I clearly make that coming to the end of this world sometime , I can responsibly live &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onic work of Mannheim , which is co @-@ operated with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ hic carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ enti@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action has been good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone should communicate openly on the boards would be understandable however , finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and mortality was still vi@@ ti@@ ated with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the farmers &quot; Hosp@@ ice &quot; have helped a lot in the last few years that people are opening up .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result Mi@@ xed , Fin@@ anz @-@ prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex gives out disappointing results for the final quarter , and the singer @-@ giant has his winn@@ ings for an entire year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ eller service .
the company also said that she plans to recru@@ it around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell on 2.5 percent in the post@@ market business 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told to earn a gain between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends on the following May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast .
analy@@ st anticipated by a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view occurs despite the price increase , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on January 4 and despite greater access for bo@@ d@@ ants of heavy and large packages that are raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects the outcome from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in the online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the weaker than expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced a day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to susp@@ end 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million were served , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 4@@ $ per share , slightly ahead of the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of z@@ acks Investment Research interviewed analy@@ st predicted .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion $ .
six of mine asked analysts expected to $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has found a decline in the international ranking , in recent years that generated sales in its unit Express @-@ shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has pushed the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , turnover increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was essentially flat due to higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit increased higher income due to higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex stocks rose by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday she concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
at their most anticipated session in the year Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark interest for the first time since almost a decade .
threat to them at an end of the dec@@ eased , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat @-@ sa@@ e is located a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maximize the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there are a seven @-@ time mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to pre@@ dict them to pre@@ dict . there will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to become un@@ locked by an unprecedented incentive since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turmoil in the global financial markets could be more cautious F@@ ed representatives to bor@@ row this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ r Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not raising interest rate , the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a Zin@@ ser@@ increase this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ an index , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday D@@ ow Jones fair average average value of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the campaign was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy is gaining the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ k &apos;s Capital at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sets at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t have to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that Zin@@ ser@@ ge would calm the financial markets because they would resolve the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
one month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow intensi@@ fication of the mon@@ et@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that in this year they were requested in spite of the complaints of the liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed the improvement on the labour market this year was substantial .
the unemployment rate sank to 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation was continuously distributed under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives noted that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Che@@ chen@@ con@@ ome at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world ended up at the end of last month after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by over 16 % in May by more than 16 % , as investors afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cr@@ ush the global growth .
this month the market recovered something that the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ als influence the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not occurred , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effect better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on U.S. economy , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China . &quot;
the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the central bank has had a huge impact in recent years .
the mere note of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that F@@ ed might be able to ign@@ ite their mon@@ et@@ ary expansion , &quot; narrow &quot; con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ mixed by the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also consul@@ ted with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month , that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which with apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
l@@ acker , vo@@ tive member of the Federal Open Market Committee , dedicated to a capital increase , quoted in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their leadership position by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limiting effects on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker .
a year later the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis like the 2008 market re@@ unification , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of Zin@@ co , because the markets stum@@ bles , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t believe it should be anticipated by the time .

more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
you are welcome to the warm welcome , not without the commitment of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
these belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .

even with her 74 L@@ ads they are still being taught .

Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tried to clarify the importance of good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on breasts , painted with representations of un@@ heal@@ thful foods .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to be carried to mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating fluctu@@ ates women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively influence the immune system .
exceptions for the new am@@ ber sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar power .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited rail rever@@ ber@@ ation at the am@@ ber sports centre come step by step forward : in the youngest community meeting , the elabor@@ ated component has been dealt with without much discussions .
at the same time , the Panel had decided to have a request for a legislative , exemp@@ tion of &quot; respect &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a permission for a special design on the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly a &quot; saddle exp@@ ach does not want to be built @-@ in with no @-@ finished First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar generators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we get a wonderfully large South @-@ ah together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the &quot; liberation &quot; , in turn , it was about the attic conversion , for energy @-@ reasons - other than in the development plan - under ten degrees .
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan has no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ber rule is usually restric@@ tive in the law of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around in the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
the costs are 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots funding .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre @-@ large hall is now submitted to the Council for the trial .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
simultaneously Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees come from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
they see what start@@ ling plans of the hospital GmbH of the Land@@ circle , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white confirmed .
however , a decision on the agenda is the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board will conven@@ e on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be moved by fishermen and the wider inner station to Ch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the co @-@ workers , which can not be done with us , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites .
the employees were informed of their plans .
triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to the question of who the successor , according to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who volunte@@ ered to take over the direction of October 1st and transferred with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case result in &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in &quot; Inner Medicine , &quot; thus Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
fishermen are specialist for heart @-@ step and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
procedure for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees that both houses agree , until then the next year the former hospital of the scar@@ city , which still has 35 beds , finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far the country had planned this for 2018 , as the current iter@@ ation is completed at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim .
the land of land , Jo@@ chner @-@ white , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered forward to what the house , which is in the possession of the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end I go out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how the real estate continues with the real estate Jo@@ chner @-@ wh@@ ites could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ at@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fishermen about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ vers to the Le@@ ch which had been positively accepted by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house , which has been working in the fishermen for over 30 years as a che@@ er , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , com@@ partments are closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs .

one since Saturday was missing 16 @-@ year old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate , is a non @-@ violent attack of the victim .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found at the Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , like pro@@ secutor and police on Wednesday .

refugees need accommodations : study warns against apartment vulner@@ ability
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of fights on the German housing market have long been begun .
with the incoming refugees and working people from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ bur@@ dened in many large cities .
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens for the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , requires worth 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this result , a study will be commissioned by the association &apos;s mandate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare : this year is done in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units .
that calls for 140@@ ,000 homes .
refugees are no longer obligated for the first three months of their stay , looking for asylum seekers in a birth@@ place of accommodation .
many will then meet in the apartment market and set off in the long queu@@ es in front of the flat rentals .
according to the Bundes@@ amt , however , less than half of all asylum seekers remained to rent in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market lies not only on rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable failures in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany strikes an apartment deficit in front of a year ago , which is bigger from year to year .
currently we were l@@ acked in the metropolitan areas around 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals in large cities therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; due to the flu@@ ff in the apartment market .
in the big cities the number of square meters per capita in the past few years has gone back for the first time .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; social exclusion is propos@@ ing a new start .
the aim is to stimulate new incentives to social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved to the underlying tax and the basic tax will be suspended for subsidi@@ zed apartments .
also , according to an alliance , attractive tax @-@ amor@@ tis@@ ation is necessary .
the promotion programme for refugee transactions of the public bank Kf@@ W is already well found in towns and villages .
a good week after the start was started on Monday , with 18@@ 4 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could be tos@@ sed .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are setting up a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no man@@ oeu@@ vre , there are more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that the visit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les allow .
however the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to cross the establishment of a corridor for refugees with the neighbouring country .
&quot; I have spoken in the slo@@ ven@@ ian culture , and if it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen area yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees to Croatia declared to come to Western Europe from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television channel RT@@ L .
Hungary was sealed off its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that occurred the same day into force do what over@@ do asylum in Hungary do practically unnecessary .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who do not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to EU @-@ neighbouring Croatia .
most of the media are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and Ta@@ xen into the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after her arrival she would have tried to go on foot across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees did not encounter on the limit .
for this the boundary relate to other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary there are hardly any refugees after closure of the border .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 .
just before the beginning of Tor@@ zi@@ pper on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overthrow and damage of the border tell us as a crime .
the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged will therefore be introduced in 35 proceedings .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country to the sentenced to five years and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities on Tuesday in the newly built &quot; Tran@@ qu@@ ake &quot; a total of 94 adher@@ ed proceeds , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition r@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
under the applicants , 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would be 40 refugees dro@@ w@@ ned .
but it is practically no longer a prospect in Hungary to get asylum .
after an hung@@ arian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seekers should be de@@ ported .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there are only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to regulate .
they gathered the garbage to leave the tens of thousands of people in the last weeks on the streets .
bor@@ ra@@ ils were built and one of the recording @-@ camps was rebuilt in the bor@@ der@@ land .
no one wanted to speak for the purpose of this transformation .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants stopped in government , but still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
the Zug@@ from there to Germany was stopped in the for@@ en@@ oon for the German authorities in the morning .
in fre@@ ew@@ heel : regular groups of refugees meet on foot regularly .
Mayor of the &quot; Gest@@ ran@@ ate &quot; over the border
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge on Sunday with the site , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice off@@ ences at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wern@@ stein &apos;s Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly un@@ prepared for the refugee stream in Austria on Sunday , for them in Wern@@ stein finished , &quot; says Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and the stran@@ ded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Middle Pass@@ au .
before we had the most hau@@ ghty guests at once again , with yo@@ ghurt , and drink .
we told you , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a matter of course for us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as coun@@ cill@@ or in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 euros for fire@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this made us very happy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Zug@@ passengers were pulled on on Sunday evening at the Wels trade show from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au to set it after the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , yet still using the border to try .
the regional train was erected at the Inn in front of the border in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border generally highly in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday se@@ greg@@ ated , days before a two @-@ fight martial - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further cigar@@ s of us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ cris@@ y policy :
instead of being in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures to help human@@ eness , our Federal Republic has repeatedly attracted the position of the Hungarian government in the aspir@@ ation of National Socialism .
hear@@ ings that this policy are not only those who are now facing in the bor@@ der@@ areas with chaotic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wing@@ ed ones will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will become a great challenge , given the sustained refugee flow and the approaching winter , with us human states for guards .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Conrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 m @-@ firm Quar@@ ters
Konrad has full power to do with the refugees .
Christian reveals that his word weight has .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen banker so as to turn lists for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first ready centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on in the neighborhood .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of an &quot; cr@@ ashing situation . &quot;
overall , Conrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the ancient year .
in order to meet the number , EUR 35@@ ,000 houses have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 countries should provide the countries 15,000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it is not a cas@@ ks without ground , &quot; said Konrad .
he has already conducted talks with the provincial cent@@ uri@@ ons .
they would have secured this , even for the coming refugees of the region .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning that is to be trans@@ figured as the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations are the asylum coordinator even in the OR@@ F promotion programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helping us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform you can simply offer private accommodation .
furthermore it is hoped that hotels , which are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally Conrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ises yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that lodging makers have to respect a certain amount of the handles or the size of the so@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the Interior Ministry , that he was more successful in keeping with his experience , Konrad with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom you cannot see without further into the face of fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness be his most important weapon .
finally Conrad and Mai@@ er do not cause any cost as they said .
their employees will want to increase it by three to four .
your own mer@@ ry @-@ hunt has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at the square Stephan@@ splatz .
however there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz demands better distribution
first , no opening of city sports halls and other buildings like Tips Arena and Design Center for Det@@ en@@ tion of refugees is planning the City of Linz .
this is currently not necessary , as people can not find anywhere without this action , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , further sites should be checked for their functions .
criticism of the Municipal Executive Committee on the division of refugees within the federal country .
also other districts must contribute to their contribution .
sea @-@ workers : &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian Council , Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) spoke Josef P@@ stir@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday further action in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer also ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not regulated .
the continued creation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now also the corresponding border controls .
special offers with refugees after Germany will not give it any more .
but the shelter would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
by the other EU member states , P@@ stir@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria again introduces controls to its borders is the logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the liner line has been officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office building and production facilities , the stock exchange cabinet is drawn to the stock exchange ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is meant to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the intelligent heads are our raw material - and we must try that they are working for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes De@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine to invest in star@@ tup companies from the new ship@@ yard , and later to raise what is equivalent .
already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from where in @-@ house a lot promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1,@@ 7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3 million euros from Tech@@ centre , which belong to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the Linz AG is well respected by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters left in the building are rented apartments for a further 40 percent give it to requests .

bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
it was done a few weeks before .

decisive for the decision was , among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own site , where only her hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the spicy in the Greater Region Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
her fashion interests has been wide placed by her mother in the cradle .
me most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag was put in duty , the expert lady can not answer with the last safety .
maybe it is because it adds value to a nice bag of any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ers .
this property also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for all @-@ off .
whether he is expressed as foreign @-@ sensitive , journalists , or matter of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s candidate for the U.S. President advoc@@ ating the election campaign strongly .
and cuts good at all .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ city where the grandparents of the real estate date originate .
the New Yorker with the promise of fishing is a notion of many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabitants is over -@@ sixty corners with him related .
his grand@@ si@@ re came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone L@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villagers think about his goal , mi@@ gh@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has a am@@ using documentary feature about the place and its famous nav@@ y butterflies , to which in addition to Tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mod@@ esty comes in &quot; King of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ city .
to the king of the heart , he did not come there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there may be respect for the family &apos;s performance , but you also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is a bit a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mas@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; random listen to the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the circuit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the makers , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus coming from the village of An@@ gi@@ ers .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather wander@@ ed and opened a local pub in the USA .
foundation of the real estate concept was the first property of property in New York .
but the life of grandparents was not free of tragedy : her wish to return to the homeland for a long time , failed to the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was assigned at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he once was without a permit , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches history and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared the film start .
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; .
this stands in contrast to the evidence of the descendants of the night .
this had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the pol@@ itely dense , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant family of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ MA was a born b@@ mp , the Op@@ a was borrowed Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winem@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced themselves &quot; he is always such a thousand @-@ thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he was never cat@@ apul@@ ted around K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm mentioned as some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Family Heinz with a visit something for the church organ , which was generally well appealing .
&quot; I cannot imagine it from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
they prove it better if he didn &apos;t want the choice , because &quot; who has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who had been in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; if he had never arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ tic Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the Tru@@ mp long , have seen 12 000 mo@@ vi@@ ers , even in the U.S. is awakening the interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming from the hand of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in the national park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ des received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Swiss Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can have no more than 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be protected as protection .
Seven &apos; s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership at the Today &apos;s show
Karl Stef@@ anie vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son is coming to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of Nine has been broadcast@@ ed by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ out the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ riad , tu@@ cked in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun belonged .
this downside of the resistance seemed to be no part of Australian TV spectators because Sun@@ rise had aver@@ aged 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five main cities , in comparison with today 4@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3.000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
today , there has been a gap of Sun@@ rise in the last few months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ .000 employees at Today .
this is the most interesting thing every morning happens .
the winds of change concern these Morgen@@ makers more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the old Seri@@ al of Ap@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama for a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father that closes with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reaching a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .

the last three agree to the Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons rim , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly appearing who The Bachelor is winning .
the woman , at the University of Sam , landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether it is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we went with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons rim in the day , before you get out of three two , you might accidentally issued a hint about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips to the finals on Thursday .
all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ ric way , why Wood is the perfect man and ex@@ iles his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you who was the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they could become fatal to the game , who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki presented both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a straightforward relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , because I felt that they were quite compatible and I have thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; said E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; she added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that their visit to the house last week made its clear that wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am un@@ condition@@ ally to it , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked to choose to Wood , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten , 19 : 30 hrs .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of the last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
some trainers would have banned from the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Du@@ eling in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to go to a Pun@@ t return and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team encouraged by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also public in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Sport @-@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialty staff coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who helped him to forget his vers@@ ed mu@@ ang and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start to place Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian trans@@ ood for its N@@ FL de@@ buted .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble cur@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a lower launch into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; he said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne gri@@ pped the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin debut in 2007 , when a pass in its own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters demand for the high refugee numbers the c@@ ess@@ ation of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger , at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn at the beginning of a difficult crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools before the collapse &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get con@@ vul@@ sions in the Bav@@ arian Educational System . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate will not be held until Friday in the Paris Comm@@ une une .
actually , quite different main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course , the topic of asylum in the surrounding region , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , just as they did during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we do not go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to postp@@ one the Free voters as quickly as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administration , responsible for asylum instruments : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ti@@ fiers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states should not be consistent : &quot; we need national standards for federal states in Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves from , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to become more hand@@ y@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics is not to fall under the table in big Wal@@ ks .
a years of long bur@@ ner remains on the agenda : the policy of education .
the new school year , Ludwig Erhard ( CS@@ U ) has launched a pilot level of three years ( CS@@ U ) , 47 Australian Asia for three years , with an extension of the high @-@ level intermediate level of three to four years - as a result , it will take nine years to go to Ab@@ it@@ ur .
but this is not far enough Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; the F@@ W chief said .
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums they want .
free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere where it is desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to the jumps
the German stock market has concluded a wide range of tra@@ ch@@ less and more nerv@@ ous commercial process with thread .
only in the afternoon a fes@@ si@@ er pr@@ el@@ ude of the US exchange for a clear direction , which ultimately cur@@ sed the D@@ ax by 0,@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

Euro@@ ph@@ xx 50 as the index of the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
robust profits also en@@ roll the trade magazines in London and Paris .
in the USA the D@@ ow @-@ Jones index most recently noted about 1 percent in plus .
many IP@@ si@@ ans therefore expect that markets to be held on this Friday after the interest rate , and also to the big exp@@ ir@@ ation of the stock exchange at this Friday .
the discussion about the burdens from the atomic rising has pushed the shares of R@@ WE to a record deep and also leave deep traces on eon .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy group probably lack an 30 billion euros for res@@ sions .
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the shares of the two largest German energy companies reco@@ vering somewhat , but ultimately always lost 3,@@ 31 percent ( R@@ WE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) .
Infin@@ eon shares go to the D@@ ax tip by more than 22 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , investors of the German Chip@@ drive system currently give too little attention .
the investments should be expected to pay off in the future w@@ af@@ er technologies and the focus on the market .
Auto@@ values were asked : even in the traditional weak summer months of August , more cars were deduc@@ ted again than in the previous year period , like the industry association Ac@@ ea , at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the car@@ ers of the car@@ makers Daimler and BMW rose by 1.7 percent and 2,@@ 21 percent .
Volkswagen advantages over@@ priced itself by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the exchange rate of exchange rate dropped to 0,@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points .
the Bund @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the course of the euro sun@@ k in the afternoon at least 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
against noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars .

4 people killed , after police kill@@ ers shoot with demonstrators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police knew rubber cord in a crowd that dis@@ continued against the proposed new constitution , an official end on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on the Tuesday evening in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , approximately 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , premi@@ er districts , said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw rocks and burnt bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot into the air before they get back on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , of which they may kill , but which are traditionally used as less fatal alternative , obviously produced a so high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as southern layers , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ us say that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ u who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent struggles since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , which has been centrally governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legis@@ lature accelerated the process after the devastating earthqu@@ akes that devast@@ ated thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Treaty in Kathmandu and have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ ble@@ man &apos;s Old Mail is to be built again .
the city currently prepares for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
planned is a mix of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are not available .
Em@@ den - The town Em@@ den wants to promote around 4,000 square meters of plot in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
planned , the premises are designed for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
wait for such offers , it is said to be on the part of the city .
which investor to ask is still not clear .
accordingly , no contracts were signed .
the city Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner Big Street , just few months ago bought and the adjacent building can be taken away .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
plans for holiday Cottage on the little sea near Em@@ den are taking shape .
the investor laid out public plans for the project first time .
quite a few tra@@ ilers are still worried - they fear the selling of their leisure activities
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months spent in closed doors was negotiated , salute , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday lodge on the little sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee .
the item originally had reached the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , with the investors and management of secret society , Ralf Hu@@ hr@@ sted away from the System @-@ Building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors .
however , it was good to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros in recent years .
fierce reactions among sea things that had come into the session were the pictures and new details about the hotel building needed .
Roberto Mr Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , laments : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ utter@@ ance that over@@ looks like all other bir@@ des . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he fears like a few other project critics that would increase the traffic by the intended size of the plant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there all the buses are coming , so that the calculation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what happens exactly on the good a h@@ ect@@ are of the old inn is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were even variable .

Google will start dou@@ bling donations campaign to earn 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign , which aims to help thousands of refugees that over@@ rolls the European nations as they escaped from the war torn away and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of let a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our journey had many dark railway and bus trips , just as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugees and migrants have grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go out to four non @-@ profit organisations , providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised from donations to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled in 11 million $ .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely prompted by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escape from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easy overweight people , weight loss can be helpful .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death dates take a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which had an editorial on the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years obesity have been proven efficiently to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people being obes@@ e with a Body measure index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain level of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can charge your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers used from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those , subjected to this operation declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with the one I received non @-@ surgical diabetes , roughly equal to 29 .
among those who have undergone a surgical procedure , at 36 % the diabetes disease is totally and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , in contrast to diabetes , diabetes is completely only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
moreover , the results were achieved in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels from ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflected the blood sugar level over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after surgery the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , it remained stable at about 8 percent in the medical treatment group .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also performs average results with the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year the B@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ om@@ ie Group ( 18,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and here@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) , and recorded a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show an survival advantage for surgery five years , there is evidence from a study involving human beings in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was under@@ mine people to die in obesity , about 29 percent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , without elevated risk of death or kidney illness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have collected these genetic changes that have connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love &apos;s History plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is now very popular in fiction : a young woman , too school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth , and she is in love with her .
so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel can be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she could place her hometown a literary monument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and responded to the real crisis in the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the grand Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed towards the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is much admired , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to overcome the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these issues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the US @-@ violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this issue lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down violence and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand@@ some inf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
Gi@@ ft@@ control centers in the United States report about a nearly 400 @-@ percentage increase in number of children under the age of twelve that may carry out strong manual dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from Hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ are in children less than 12 years , the Gi@@ ft@@ control centers report , of 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the p@@ up , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ab@@ utting off , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a nuts in social media .
videos on YouTube show how people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth have supposedly mixed a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ based mou@@ th@@ wash to get a tougher drink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
younger children can be ho@@ cked by attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the attractive non @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants are the ones that are parked .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent of alcohol .
especially in infants can lead to a few sp@@ las@@ ers to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ch center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let a sip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and if children are coming from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which recently acquired four sp@@ las@@ ers from after straw@@ berry smell inf@@ ect@@ ant in school was brought into an emergency treatment .
their blood @-@ based concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which in an adult adher@@ ed to law , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated it at the G@@ alan@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ th her words and was unable to go when she arrived at the shelter .
doctors monitored during the night in a separate children &apos;s ill hospital at the sign of hir@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl was lost by the alcohol and had to meet the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very scary , &quot; said Or@@ k@@ toria , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez , parents and teachers recommended to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant to use and hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
over Al@@ intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario women died after the slip of hanging inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ proclaimed ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol has been contained , a deadly solution , instead of eth@@ anol , which has been noted as a drug .
in January , three students of the fourth class were po@@ is@@ oned in the state of New York , their &quot; puppy &quot; teacher , using anti @-@ bacterial products all around the classroom , &quot; said a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hill@@ sides and ex@@ iles them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contem@@ por@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the discipl@@ ined approach to the authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of a title competition in the Scottish football @-@ bor@@ lt Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there are no title of rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers there .
de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will revol@@ ve around , gl@@ and@@ ed Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la did not accept that Celtic will have to fight but the Norwegian head thr@@ ush , the things turn around .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure of the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now have five point lead to the top of the table .
Dei@@ la said : &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to get out of it as soon as possible .
I know it is extremely frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly so - but we must go on .
we really need support provided by Celtic , because that makes the player better .
now together we are so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged throughout the period from May to July , whereas the number of people without work for the UK as a whole grew by 10,000 to 1,@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was 5.@@ 9 percent was about that of 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cal ( ons ) show .
in the meantime , the employment was in Scotland by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent in the course of the quarter - a figure on the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has put the cornerstone for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I will be a witness to the execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is replaced by the tox@@ ins .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and as often more applicants are available as seats , a flawless finish will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , who will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do this .
in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit with my own relationship with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone numbers and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we laugh many times when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner , as he wants , and you will get access .
I refer to her .
she adm@@ its that she could have put it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had trouble with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him he can remove myself from his list of witnesses .
but he wants an international re@@ porter , to write there .
if he dies , he thinks he will help public relations with the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the show of pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again for all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Com@@ sip is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of fact .
but I believe that a strong chance is that he is not guilty of killing .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I shall see him dying .
I cannot claim to be truly objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can apply for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die useless death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pick him up and threatens to end the racing game
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria tried to install and im@@ min@@ ate a sp@@ y in his stables first year in the past year .
he focuses on the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she ran a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai about a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do that which is best for racing and he was able to find himself under difficult circumstances , when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ on at Li@@ dar@@ i whom he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations , and did not want to see it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have been eating long , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it was far@@ ing .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I must live with it what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about to go about it , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should no longer be trainers .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had brought the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ated department had tried to pi@@ ke its stable .
&quot; before the eigh@@ teen months Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will design@@ ate - and offered him a work in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed to believe me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , the president of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time today and are still today .
should I consider that being personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L treat themselves and is maybe people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say is to think about it now .
but I am now at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the frustr@@ ations level of the trainer have been assembled with the long lasting Kob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to it that he could &quot; throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ le@@ ased master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the days of the racing series &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse debate , which ran against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of race sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my collaborators got lost mud on the leg .
it could have been yesterday evening like that .
it could have been the whole day just what was so .
it had also been so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an inquiry into the matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who have set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bell@@ y@@ amy was the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; in the Tac@@ oma .
Bell@@ y@@ amy , added that the critique of two leading trainers in his team agree with him , because it was a fact that they were worried about the Storm Team .
&quot; it emerges always and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring struggles , when they told us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ inge on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed any of our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ cles a real emphasis and it has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is already strange as this is always shown again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ inge benefits the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and re@@ mind@@ ing its ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons held the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he played his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ inge .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said it will take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I don &apos;t need to trust because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they did not think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ inge also pointed out that the game Storm opposed to Roo@@ ster , achieved a higher result than the game behind the bronze against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ s was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks do and have no points of gri@@ pping ?
for me it is the schedules .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet at a stage still .
the Storm team won free this weekend since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start from next service tomorrow .
Ser@@ bians with 200.000 $ 200,000 deposit after drug application
a man who could possibly get a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his temp@@ o to get into possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that were pushed to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200.000 $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu , and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he set his co @-@ accused in the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer by Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café from a harmless reason could have been .
the judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of such a matter , he was lied to the police concerning his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had provided a security of 200,000 dollars as security as it comes to achieving its release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ ghty explanations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judges flan@@ agan .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from performing it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , on the police force every day and moves on a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to tigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of inde@@ cent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it by , found the confusing reports and aler@@ ted immediately her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research that used concepts for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g cont@@ ented for the officers that he would have done it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an would be to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pro@@ secutor of E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people .
he adm@@ ills that seeking was conducted on the computer from him , said it was done because he wanted to assert a poli@@ cem@@ an , to ag@@ ophi@@ le pi@@ ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he is sick in his head , when he drinks , and said , he wants to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at tre@@ mb@@ ling and at wines .
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and made the defend@@ ants thus .
the girl was interviewed and told that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , found guilty in the sense of the indictment to have rejected un@@ permanent images of children on 14 June last year , released on 25 January of this year against the conditions and not to be released before hearing on March 24 of this year .
defen@@ ders lawyer , S@@ im asked to find that ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual pris@@ als , since one might argue that &quot; no such sexual element &quot; can be found in his ent@@ ou@@ rage .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from the judgment of October until October , to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted in this case , but was held in provisional custody due to hear@@ ings at other periods .
it was added before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
smug@@ gl@@ itter soft to small border out@@ puts to Germany
more and more refugees will be picked up by the big control points of the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks can be found out of fear of the discovery and detention of the people increased to smaller fron@@ tier .
out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , there were over 1,000 refugees in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on the German side by foot over bridges and dust .
there they are transported from the Federal Police in the reception and passed on to the registration .
at the Munich railway station , following the German police station , in comparison to the weekend , on Wednesday we again met more refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alone until 8@@ pm are about 700 people in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man on the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the town had reached the town on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : st@@ ints of Tro@@ pen@@ ny &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
Meteor@@ ologist warn of storm @-@ pl@@ ou@@ ches in the southwest of Mid@@ wo@@ chn@@ ya .
because of a low pressure @-@ area across Western European rivers , warm sea air in the country , divided the German Wetter@@ dienst ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sturdy me@@ ief is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the Tro@@ ph@@ ma@@ sturb@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was pulled over the Atlantic over the last few days over the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ showers are expected mainly in Baden .

on Friday we can see the sun once more .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is especially noticeable in the comp@@ actors that are currently selling at present .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand for : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registrations , according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( O days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept autom@@ obil@@ es and new super@@ ce@@ es and luxury cars , this year presents many new compact models .
one of the greatest Premi@@ ers for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , who will stand at the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra model for us is an extremely important model , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume of the volume is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not get much more expensive .
Opel is placing an entry under the biggest competitor VW Golf in the prospect which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs off at 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
in addition , the H@@ esse contains other diesel engine and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp , for which for the first time also three @-@ cylinder pet@@ rol engines .
unlike the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra only as a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is already on the IA@@ A .
and what happens next to A@@ stra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competition into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is situated only as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and a stressed sport GT version .
at trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan brand wants to grow its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
thanks to this , the compact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Infin@@ iti &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adap@@ ts with its s@@ inu@@ ous lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model is given a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines , with a newly developed 1.0 liter engine and a capacity of 82 kW / 111 PS .
the maximum torque is for manufacturing information at 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed all the comp@@ ass model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Able@@ ton laid out in front of all hands on the front part : here the cooler Ki@@ rill was drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology .
in the interior area , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IA@@ A in the comp@@ actor @-@ class a series of over@@ jobs and new varieties such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary manor @-@ manor , the month in one to small cell has been placed .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally claim financial compensation , if they are stored in too small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
those affected can even hope for money if they were imprisoned in the close rooms only a few days ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell containing some five square meters ground floor ; the toilet was spatial , not separate .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on an open foot in a larger cell .
his official ar@@ rests due to the dis@@ sol@@ ation conditions against the country Berlin failed .
but the constitutional mag@@ in@@ verter took the judgment of the chamber of Berlin and rejected the case to re @-@ test it .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber : decision on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons within the questionable time only a few days of the fra@@ gment for compensation would be decisive , be an equ@@ itable standard , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be an attempt to fear the integrity of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of tax rep@@ ut@@ ations .
the constitutional mag@@ in@@ ers often have strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they said they were only in April of a prisoner har@@ ness , because he was locked up naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is to make a decision of 2011 also the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed on a in@@ mate in a parallel event in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was taken over three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in the same cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the head@@ lines during the last weeks as well because of missing personnel .
prisoners , therefore , are still locked up in 23 hours , raising aggres@@ si@@ vity , even to bat , it should have come for the tense situation .
according to the information of the legal police , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of young lack of lack , 19 should be dropped by 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is decided to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers can come to Germany under the figures of the Federal Bureau of Germany this year , after statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , Germany is even able to take a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say back again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can say and again : we can do that , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
it is needed for different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) homes every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatically , the lack of living room , but especially at affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ ,000 and 80@@ ,000 social apartments from the rental price drop out , and around these particularly cheap apartments will also participate in refugees .
the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute : 80 thousand social apartments each year would have to rise and , for this , the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
both scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the refugees fle@@ dged in Germany over the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is important whether they are working in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration @-@ researchers Diet@@ rich th@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , it has been a political turning point : out of the labor ban on refugees that contributed to recognition of labour .
while there was a labour market for asylum seekers between up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ lights , the asylum seekers , to a residence .
in society - also because of the lack of qualified labour - mostly the perspective was taken that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labor market are missing German skills .
so far , there is still no adequate offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the build of networks is therefore in view of the Thr@@ es@@ hardt the Royal Road towards labour integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin Scho@@ ol@@ é has found that only a few fled their children to the kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only once important to bring the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ gan@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate Administration .
to see the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes to the administration of not@@ ep@@ ad in several languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase greatly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to raise the training capacity - for example by allowing more medical training .
in the countries students are prepared for education in the classes of work .
however , they are not always taught by teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language .
there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ ations from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
generally , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or the thought of thinking - the only exception has so far been Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be easier to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence permit or di@@ ul@@ arity do not receive any benefits according to the asylum @-@ law Act , if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter , basically , is not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since she does not fall under the circle of the pale persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for so far , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens this span for 15 months .
but this financing is also needs to be concluded , Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will in future play a more important role in the future , for many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should admit to the same rights as it should have the churches , and the existing state churches have the right to develop into a new state of religion .
also , the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who professionally take care of the new arri@@ vals .
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must be clear and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him some control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes a readiness to face up against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concerns , religious conflicts might also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to take such conflicts in Germany now have their right to stay here sometimes , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested using the Basic Law on Arab to translate .
integration will be much more important in the future than today .
this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
admittedly , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have a anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory employment and an Appe@@ al Law for nearly a decade .
however , it is very slow , how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ al series became systematically ignored in the police and authorities to systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all migrants &quot; migrants and stakeholders in non @-@ white German have long called for long @-@ term international agreements , such as the anti@@ racism project in Germany , must be in reality when the country will remain peaceful and use its new citizens to exploit its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
generally , Germany is able to provide medical assistance to the far @-@ anticipated refugees , for example , Doc@@ tor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what affects al@@ - power and capacities , we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needed to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery requires all arri@@ vals right in the register of health cards .
the services could be re@@ funded with the Bundes@@ länder later .
and in the long run , it is highly questionable as many people are ex@@ po@@ ised with the limited performance catalogue that I see the asylum @-@ law .
otherwise , the doctors make use of all the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven to be worse than other patients are worse than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical standards , interpreter would have to be taken charge , calls them .
furthermore , many refugees also would be patient with more general medical appeal in the emergency treatment .
and with another diagnostic view .
in the refugee camp , there are about a lot more untreated disabilities , and in the young people there is about HIV education .
with the partly different path@@ ic pictures , German doctors are concerned about their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; and as regards the ambul@@ atory angel , even in the sight of the refugees may even be reli@@ eved in sight .
the Syri@@ ans would have been a highly developed education system , several refugees even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice them , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and may take back examinations again .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany are mentally ill ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from a post@@ injury disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable the refugee camp , declares Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent published study by the Technical University Munich is that every fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
whoever is ill on a post@@ injury progression is suffering from other things at the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respiratory problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and de@@ x@@ ieties .
further symptoms are bed@@ - and concentration @-@ dys@@ functions , severe ru@@ th@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to avoid that symptoms would be chronic , be necessary as early treatment , stated Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees get their therapy .
though , mentally ill @-@ seekers can place an application for psycho@@ therapy , but it usually takes several months to work .
in addition , in most of the workers , mostly commercial workers or doctors , who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new staging of &quot; passion &quot; the Circus sits back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract any age group in the B@@ ann of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage , and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Williams invited into the man@@ ege on the brick , w@@ n@@ oses to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine how to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ zi@@ hr@@ er and Jun@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ ization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift of inspiration , the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us it is important to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a totally different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year old j@@ uni@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Chief Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinced by talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family the audience with w@@ it and charm in her spell .
also the Castillo Brothers understand their crafts .
with the heroes of the silent movies I want to take up the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s her@@ ons in the storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from a number of salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus itself also fascin@@ ate with flair and laughter .
with the unic@@ ycle on a sphere balance ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
slim people fascin@@ ates and fascin@@ ate you at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little by little and fascinated by their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals are part of our family , &quot; underlines the Stephan@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte .
the abuse in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to different animal protection organizations .
Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; if we are not doing well with our animals , it is not good for us too . &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every cu@@ dd@@ ling unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fourth @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , is after every request from the eyes be read . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel not comfortable , it does not want to take into the man@@ ege .
so the first commandment is good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is sparkling proud .
the two animals have spent eight years in a en@@ closure and nothing has happened .
&quot; surely then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo &quot; , &quot; says Brig@@ itte proportions .

Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Afri@@ el@@ dest leaders , came down the stairs beginning of the year on a podium .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls rapidly spread across the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they would have obtained anonymous victims and warned that they have been encouraged to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bu@@ cks .
last month they had booked it and lost him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions makers have received SMS messages on their phones which have warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they warned the affected Parliament members that immunity lifted in parliament , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
Chief Executive Officer , CEO of Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; ap@@ prehen@@ sive &quot; about the dangers posed by politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to demol@@ ish about 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP is later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction results in a load of more than $ 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who should guide unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming smaller and more focused than HP is today and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ yearly sales and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ ri@@ dden technology solutions for companies , &quot; says a company &apos;s declaration .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems , and the Palo Alto Garage man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring of restructuring to tackle the coming from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused enterprises provide a better performance .
arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as long as its rehabilitation runs according to Plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England , and in the light of his history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly still uncertain .
the great shame regarding this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season following a separate in@@ ant injury and then back to his old momentum during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not well @-@ healed .
it is not a big matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in touch with his knees , or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from the medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of other injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
research by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd shares 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ire in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have recorded most offen@@ ders .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a decent time period , a time when you have to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and going through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its champi@@ ons season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lanes , next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns into a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Lin@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give players that need to get a little break @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the arm@@ our@@ y are clear favour@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the biggest intimi@@ dating effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign in the last season has been started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ded on Tuesday evening by an earthquake which measured on the Richter scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and continues to lead by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to his first European ap@@ ocr@@ e triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more dist@@ res@@ sed than ever before , as su@@ icide would prove among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ rant ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a miserable life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of facing the culture in order to seek help if they need those .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to master this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that if the suff@@ erer has had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; to double its chances on recovery .
for those who are not depressed , a circle of mental healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once , so that a friendship may work .
in the age of more than social media communications with their focus on style on substance , in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer is often more important than just an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , vital and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist &apos;s extr@@ ins@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ ors and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money really cannot buy .
the Beautiful in Friends was that this focus was placed on my head .
each character was not defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers of hu@@ gs hu@@ gs , moments while playing football in cozy seats and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to it , even though they often have to be able to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as one of the staff of telephone calls , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my hear@@ tening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; role for people who feel depressed and su@@ ici@@ ously , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind in mind if I try to offer long @-@ term loading mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status of the phone people may also look at people &apos;s eye @-@ looking desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you can visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest with the perfect setting for the celebration of the day , why do not take your friends to a drink in central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone sitting around , give him a smile and say Hi .
you never know what kind of friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to grass@@ lands
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ win Cav@@ ani after his hit to Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö .
here is the board and reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ ting Par@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of the Champions League Deb@@ ate as PS@@ G players , who brought the French champion to the way , but afterwards she pas@@ sively increased a number of occasions before she finally increased their lead , as Cav@@ ani at the 6@@ 1st minute a head @-@ ball scored .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish masters because they not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the C.@@ O.@@ O.@@ S but also to improve on the path to quarter @-@ finals on each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a clone of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs failed chances in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his hometown team and against the association , with whom he began his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I do not regret we have not yet scored one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned to Paris for its injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was now spread out by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine sword @-@ wing has been described as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he indicated why when he went to Manchester United rat@@ tis pass behind the Malmö city before going to Johan Wil@@ and passes over into the long corner of the network .
but if anyone believed that PS@@ G was reaching a great victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , which provided Celtic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this stage , came at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national play@@ mates on the field and was ranked against a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ area a severe enemy .
but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who pass far to Kevin Tr@@ isha P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave himself on , with some failure and bad plu@@ gs , not least by I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which in no less than five attempts were seized in the first half and then abandoned after being abandoned after the restart .
nevertheless he reported much more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ player into play , and it was a pass of I@@ ne@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic that turned Di Maria into a turn@@ around that was passing by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er therefore generated his sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts on that Malmö could come back to the game and only a excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result low before the replacement ship was rep@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi a gate at the end .
the coach from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave to that , that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification play are not enough . &quot;
hat in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she &apos;s not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then they do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; said Dam@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown , shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the acting from The Mar@@ tian gr@@ un@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the produ@@ t @-@ mates Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , who is beaten up by her white turn .
the producer of De@@ ar White people sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the direction of the film ; Dam@@ on re@@ trac@@ ted that their direc@@ ting &quot; At the end of us could give something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter , Mr Po@@ oni thrust his anger through the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks on the only black person in the room , so he can explain her variety - this is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned over 5,000 re@@ ets and 4.000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ien comments are coming at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teenage sons was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter on a nationwide impact and ur@@ ging law@@ makers and authorities , discrimin@@ atory practices against colourful settings .
in February , the singer Prince took a stop on the movement during the introduction of nom@@ inees for the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album For@@ matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , the movement of the Movement Black lives Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tainers , producers and media sites , who are invited to visit the pop@@ e in order to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; Best champion
professional athlete and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday Even@@ ing and took the Big Prize of 1 Million $ .
the competition show , which had just finished off their 7th season , has never experienced a contest of competition , who was able to finish all steps of his obstacle course .
throughout the season there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten until the Fin@@ als .
the climbing task was to climb at a 75 foot long climbing , in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten had completed the task within the time which he had completed the first athlete who ended the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ en@@ ero ended his challenge in full three seconds quicker , making him the winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ a@@ ero spoke with E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock on winning the Grand prize of 1 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is amazing how to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to live in life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with the Hollywood re@@ porter , to discuss the Fin@@ als and why B@@ ritten , although he was first ended at all the circuit , won &apos;t get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he might have something like that .
he &apos;s just so happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone I am happy that Isaac is Isaac &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as different if they didn &apos;t different the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ O@@ POL@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
in the past they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League .
the Tig@@ ers are pared down to their role as Spo@@ iler , they played this part however on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins were shot a chance to climb within a game of Houston , for the second American League of Wild@@ Card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that has been so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tiger &apos;s manager Brad T@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support , when Detroit offered three times in the first two inner points , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times on in the 1 / 3 inner and enabled three R@@ us .
it was just his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year , &quot; said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ seye every game and therefore I want entirely concentrating in the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ Hitler Mart@@ ine@@ z had three results and was in two R@@ us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid August .
it was the first three @-@ day hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits on Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has s@@ war@@ med the bu@@ y@@ wood &quot; he said .
he looked good at the tro@@ pics ) , saw distinc@@ tly better from the bull@@ seye , and he carried it straight into the game .
with three of us at the back of the seventh year , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center field@@ der B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field .
Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a pit@@ ch@@ unt , and Simon brought his second captain Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ise Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy covered the wall , the only man he was faced with , before the nomin@@ ee ro@@ ok@@ ie po@@ ison Miguel S@@ ano , who abolished the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a Two @-@ Run .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I was moving and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first of the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ man , Hus@@ hai gave a single to Second Bas@@ le Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .

the Tig@@ ers rose in the second , achieved a one @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ Out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ pot .

Ischgl : German military action in Syria an option
the Chief of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the mis@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we have been glad that the cup had gone by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict came out in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for massive form of international aid to refugees .
Austria is controlled in Southern and Eastern borders
to Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary , nobody now returned .
also Germany has returned no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so arranged &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement , by which Germany could host a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there was already discussions between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concrete numbers gave them not and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria on the so @-@ called bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man filed an extraordinary summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers conven@@ ing to arrive at a special meeting on Tuesday 22 ( 22 September ) at a special meeting to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee sheet in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the in@@ up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , calling for Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultation with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin .
Merkel underlined , for people , the protection , be@@ ck@@ men this as well .
but he who has no lead @-@ perspective could not remain in Germany either .
this idea had been divided into round in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole would now require a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of distr@@ acted refugees are now stuck on the bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia with the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent that smug@@ gl@@ ers were seeking out of Romania over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister said Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to the planned new border @-@ con@@ cre@@ ek .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of migrants were reported on the way to the Greek border .

this is what researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini . &quot;

this de@@ mar@@ ic movement is only small , but still too big for a thoroughly stable population , in a communication from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers represent their analyses in the specialist paper &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;

Ram@@ ah had cl@@ ed about pain in the beginning of the week .
according to Mün@@ chner lions , the diagnosis &quot; is expected for four weeks of pat@@ ching @-@ time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us heavy , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ s@@ la Nec@@ roman@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible obligation of a united front . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often quite dis@@ coura@@ ged from them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - mainly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them are B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. most of all included man@@ gos but lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
he who eats the fruits thus supports visual power , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and sm@@ elled .
the form@@ work @-@ color alone says nothing about the ripe fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very delicious .
they should store at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste natural or in sweet food .
but there are also hearty meals a special note .

on Wednesday and Wednesday night the F@@ öh@@ n partially blows with the storm @-@ strength through the F@@ ed @-@ valley .
after the end on Thursday morning we crosses a striking K@@ alt@@ front , that puts strong rainf@@ alls , wind bows and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland currently stands on the forefront of an extensive low pressure @-@ area on the British islands in a powerful southern @-@ west .

Rome is now Martin Luther &apos;s place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther King &apos;s place now .
in the presence of the President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday , a previously un@@ finished place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bap@@ tised to the name of the German Reform@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an der Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was submitted by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded that Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the City of Pop@@ es could only live over centuries as a minority often only in secret their faith .
the square is in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the year in 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city then as materi@@ alised sin .
his negative impressions , according to historians have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome in his later struggle against Rome .
he had then introduced with his theses about the las@@ h@@ las@@ h@@ del , the division of the Catholic Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( per@@ gol@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the capitals that Oth@@ mar ( old ) painted for his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with outstanding pictures now .
at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Old , formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his very personal interpre@@ tations of Bible and canvas in 150 exhibits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted the respective subjects , that can quite be quite ble@@ ak .
about three years of Ot@@ mar &apos;s old worked to his Bible @-@ project for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of &quot; books of all books . &quot;
emerged are cycles that apply issues such as cross @-@ ends , pl@@ agues , prec@@ ep@@ ts or pat@@ ernity .
he has immediately fascinated spontane@@ ously several partners : this is true for the Luther House with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books .
and that is , in particular , the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , who dealt with the painting of the painting with the respective scriptures .
he interpreted the scriptures that have been interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt - and thus into today , into current relations . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who put his very personal thoughts on the situation here .
the decorative band has Golden Let@@ ters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal twice a deep insight into his soul , its emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
emotion was ultimately not at all a trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Old , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant reign of the religious community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the education already happened to the Rohr@@ stock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oth@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work hard to do this again in order to bring my father to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to re @-@ show the art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of images are moul@@ ded today by complaints , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &apos;s old wants that the viewer will refrain from the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come down in themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post ple@@ ted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible within the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; which has always been &quot; a lover of Oth@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he understands it with his pictures . &quot;
old did not take care of judging the Bible completely , but that selected for him important , even mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no cooperation on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a section of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas image - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be presented at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ foundation on 15 November .
construction work for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , enterprise charged , pe@@ ppers for a circuit mod@@ eled : one year later it was almost all done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was finally finished .
failures in politics and administration created for the dr@@ one , especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the train .
first hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the authorization will come in in October , could communicate the first parish community of Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former Hall@@ statt too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment for refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga are showing a clear sign in the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the mounting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in the control of each individual to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said S @-@ leader of Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
during the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the Minister of Tourism in O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and want to help .
but the crucial course needs to pose politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German football fan has therefore expanded his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program will run until 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some federal lig@@ ists support this program .
already on this weekend the 36 promot@@ ers place a clear sign if they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship of sponsor@@ ers ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We help &quot; contribute to the # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , Sport@@ al@@ ates Ru@@ di Völ@@ s of the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Tuesday ) and recorded the project as a &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee &apos;s drama deals every one , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer league , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Manager Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
the Euro @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday inviting the national team of women 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 roy@@ alties were running their own projects in their places would be great .
what is great about the fact that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , will be in football in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government sets up to 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already announced the whole amount for 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP managing director loses a eye for accidents
the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has confirmed the left eye to several reports by a fall in early July .
after the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to midnight where he fell to a water jar , which he carried in the left hand , the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost em@@ bled , and f@@ ain@@ ly , then moved out to the street - that he told us the last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ where &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ Tech H@@ asso Plat@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could prove his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the board of directors in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( thunder@@ ings ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to be able to stop once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...

football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ure @-@ cellar in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia , Dortmund finally broken up all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europe League .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the soccer league alongside the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether the event will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , we left the BV@@ B @-@ coach : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high burden of his professionals , K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his ancest@@ ry position at the reel &apos;s position .
so he announced a change on the door position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking place in the place by tribal Roman Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he is trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher the World Champion .

with high probability , he will also manage the second game .
the for@@ ged statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ alist must be the goal of BV@@ B in the Europe League will be the aim of understandable , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehensible : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco isn &apos;t that wrong . &quot;

robot &apos;s cars : government wants to take the lead in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner in the change of cars in technological forefront after the federal government &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cab@@ inet thus decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
at the end of Wednesday at Frankfurt am Main , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said at the edge of the brand IA@@ A from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
the automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and make for less steel , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
to discuss the issue also with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , he will also meet with representatives of the industry at the IA@@ A .
among other things the strategy &apos;s strategy paper stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band installation and a high level of productivity on digital radio .
to test the testing of new technology , a test circuit is currently on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are postponed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government intends to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany does not want to use internationally for this , that the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars has risen from 10 to 130 k@@ kilometers .
the German government should also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
while automated driving takes over , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that can capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly @-@ automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , traffic @-@ free vehicles on public roads will be expected only far by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
added value in the field of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions at the Federal Republic of Germany will appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; digital connectivity of the P@@ K@@ s can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; said the SPD &apos;s SPD member against Bar@@ ra@@ l .
the issue of liability in in@@ sei@@ z@@ ure and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified .
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute on behalf of the T@@ sa Institute , the result is that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 34 per cent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of the respondents reck@@ oned up to 20@@ 25 , with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , motor@@ ists in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving car .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic can still imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
almost every Fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Tab@@ le@@ ping @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will now only want to fight the title on the title of September 25 to October 4 only in the single one .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys got to know it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough even without attacking the title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the S &amp; D Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ apprenticeship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship for sponsor@@ ing in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to be held on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without him the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ charter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who introduces the S@@ etz@@ ke in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European Championship in Sh@@ ams .
&quot; back then he did not miss , and we have become Europ@@ ame@@ master . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should base ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world tran@@ far@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck .
it is a mix of very large fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ w@@ ns pop @-@ up user . the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) showed an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window man@@ nequins , which look aw@@ ful thanks to video projects frigh@@ tening human .
they bear the spectacular creations from the French designer , one among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and with that it tasted men in the skirts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before it was very light , now it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om &quot; side@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a luck that the Mo@@ des@@ k@@ est@@ ter has changed its initial position towards a show of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sound a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made it in Canada and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly an impres@@ sion@@ able work of the man , who has written the fashion history without ever having an education .
for example , the show is not constructed but is an excellent , chore@@ ograph@@ ed total work , for which much effort was operated : in order to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was introduced .
14 tons of material made the creators according to details of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October legend , it was a special note : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ dy old Ted@@ dy is shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d o@@ iling @-@ attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and poorly in football ) he took his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a pupp@@ et to play , his parents would not have allowed him .
he discovered the dis@@ c@@ ashing of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and watched the dra@@ fts of other designers , as recently told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
but I bought it later but of course .
for his first own fashion show , he could not pay the model .
they got nothing , but they were able to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
it used to be in the long nit@@ rogen in and around Pl@@ aces , feet .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tops have been produced in large quantities for customers they have further worked on for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ ra@@ yon &apos;s offices .
instead the fashion is important .
at the beginning of the Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s peak , fashion played a major role , was then mis@@ ed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
at all fine the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , who leans towards past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a growing company potential .
those in the textile industry in Germany are no more cat@@ ers , is no longer on the market .
for us they already make half of all orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cking @-@ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is together with nine other companies in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Industry Association Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and embro@@ ider@@ ies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the sales were destroyed .
private specialist stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no more .
our products are rarely accessible to customers in this way .
the mass @-@ ware nowadays are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively distributed on chains .
furthermore , weak@@ ening of export , current to Russia and in the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , as Cord@@ ula Bauer is explained by the nit@@ ric blade in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we are leading a quality seal , that shows that we produce environmentally sound and socially balanced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt supplies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this refers to the used materials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diploma @-@ design U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the snail University of the West@@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and shar@@ ks .
to deal with the competition from the Asian region , there is a need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a clash between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , who must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design often only varies easily to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was anew the historical snow @-@ all@@ u@@ head again .
sti@@ cking the machine at some places small kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ e@@ de@@ filed at Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ds inspired it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could do nothing with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ all@@ u@@ pointed for their jewellery .
in an elaborate process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener &apos;s point - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies them to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to clients whose ancestors used in chew@@ ing and surrounding areas and would like to mem@@ ori@@ ze a souvenir .
so I see my jewellery as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends should not be moved , but Disney was still coming to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
but it goes out loud &quot; entertainment Weekly , &quot; but rather a new mat@@ ing , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny .
this is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the economic crisis in England .
who P@@ opp@@ ins played more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI aim to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside , to foster growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was asked to manage the reform .
&quot; China should work to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the central guidance group for a deepening of a comprehensive reform .
raising reform and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of policies , including a neg@@ ativity to control the market access , relaxation , border controls policy , encouraging establishment controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the citizen &apos;s det@@ ector .
after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , which identifies sectors and businesses that do not respond to investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of importance because it indicates the market a greater role in the provision of resources , ensuring the public @-@ state business environment and open the market more open , the statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls to the powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to do their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of a quote , under @-@ controlled sectors , other areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; if the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee , to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister David Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as was reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double up mer@@ cur@@ y border in rob@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cur@@ y in big rob@@ bers and consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ating the action critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects failed industrial and environmental policy are passed along with full weight of pregnant and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt from F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt , the threshold values of the nerve @-@ poison@@ ous can be raised for big fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , &quot; economic reasons &quot; by one to two milli@@ grams quot@@ a per kilo@@ gram of fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , big predat@@ ory Fish is so heavily charged with mer@@ cur@@ y that could not be sold on the basis of the remaining threshold values for about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dou@@ bling of the threshold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be f@@ atten@@ ed .
in return for this lo@@ ader the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram capac@@ itor per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch was doing this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller bur@@ d@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low , that they are already respected the planned maximum levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crash at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ schmi@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is one for the people high poison@@ ous heavy metal , which is highly competitive above all in predat@@ ory fish .
the German government warns that &quot; already small amounts of particularly can cause in the injuries of the nervous system .
the Federal Department of Environment states on its website with regard to the current maximum value , but that an &quot; health threat of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
Mercury is above all due to coal @-@ burning in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of German , German coal @-@ power plants encounter more than six tonnes of Mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y in fish in the Elbe , Rhein and Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently exceeded and by surface &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from mer@@ cur@@ y in fish have already been reported to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ SF@@ F .
