the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine at the implementation of the provisions of the section I via F@@ ishing measures as required .
the objective of the provision measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the significant significant amount of nuclear plants for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ts for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such di@@ version through the risk of premature discovery .
for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the in Article 28 fixed target , the material preservation is of fundamental importance , verbal with the spatial input , and observation as important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the assessment carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material selection , specified for a specified period of time not proven material , under indication of the most accurate devices for the specified measurement .
when carrying out their retro@@ spec@@ tions , the organization makes for Articles 3 full use of the securing system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material in accordance with the Convention is based on an outline in material composition .
when using their backup measures , the community of de procedure and measures will make use of the following kind of use , and they , as far as required , fores@@ ee@@ able how they are defined in supple@@ mental install@@ ments more closely and purpose .
a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preser@@ v@@ ated , her@@ ated , vers@@ ed , lost or in other ways from the continu@@ ance of remote material and the inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;

the backup measures after this Convention are not stretched on material in mining or with the arch@@ ation .
B ) is uran - or th@@ ori@@ onic material which has not yet reached a phase of the kernel @-@ fuel cycle that has not yet reached the states , so that the community of the organisation divi@@ des the quantity and composition of the material if it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , suitable for composition and pur@@ ity for fuel oil production or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will be implemented in a later phase of the kernel @-@ containing nuclear material into the states , so it is subject to the other termin@@ ology measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) Con@@ vey@@ ed in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community is subject to conception that the back@@ rest of nuclear material , the backup measures referred to this Convention is not possible or desired , as the organisation and community are relevant to the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The backup measures mentioned in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community will determine practically non @-@ profit .
on request of the Community the organisation releases the following nuclear material from the backup measures following this Convention :
a ) special sp@@ ectable material if it is used in gramm@@ s - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;

C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation by Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
searching for the Community the organization liber@@ ated the organization of nuclear material that would otherwise be subject to the Convention on this Convention , provided that the entire , due to this article in the states of core materi@@ al@@ ments at no time amounts to no more than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogra@@ m special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :

III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment which is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
( C ) twenty @-@ ric tons of demol@@ ished urine with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or among ;
is intended to be liber@@ ated nuclear material along with nuclear material , which is subject to the backup measures after this Convention , are processed or stored , so precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of the backup measures on that material .
the Community deals with the organization supplements which are required in the scope of establishing the successful and effective accompl@@ ishment of the tasks of the organization after this Convention , in which they determine the procedures established in the Convention .

in the provision of this l@@ ending , the bai@@ li@@ ff may be guided in accordance with the regulations of the EEC relating to the following factors :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the trend of the debt management of the country and its further credit capacity capacity to Dar@@ re@@ ens@@ ations without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are to regulate the problems of the countries concerned by contributions from other sources .
any special response @-@ ins@@ cription serves to finance a clearly @-@ ris@@ er and rapidly out@@ pay@@ able development program or pre @-@ service ( including a sec@@ toral position ) , regardless , approved and managed according to the procedure and practices that will be approved and managed by sub@@ ordin@@ ate ( under code ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .

capital expenditure of special response values take place on the special application account , and thus the amount paid in the currency of a member state has returned to its receipt as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member States concerned .
the administrator has taught until full re@@ location of all special response by the EEC relating to the directors in preparation and about the directors approved and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of the pay@@ out of the special response , the administrator has taught the EEC quarter each year on the development of the special response and the expenses .

the blood flow occurs as@@ ep@@ tical ; the blood is direc@@ tional through a closed , ster@@ iles tube into a ster@@ ile bottle , into which the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ si@@ zing solution was frozen in front of the ster@@ il@@ isation .
after completion of the ble@@ eding , the bottle is immediately visible and cool at a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , they may only be opened immediately before the use of blood .

a concentr@@ ates of human red blood cells is a unity of human full@@ ness , from which the largest part of the pl@@ asma was removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood @-@ body components can be present or may be partially removed .
the hydr@@ ation content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the rest of pl@@ asma or from an appropriate isot@@ onic artificial artificial solution that was assigned to the removal of the pl@@ asma .
the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ vol@@ um@@ ens ( hem@@ at@@ oph@@ rit ) on the label .
all processes required for the process required must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the treat@@ ise must be carried out under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by printing .

to switch to the dam@@ aging effect of the bacterial products in pl@@ asma , blood sp@@ ice , the signs of a bacterial contamin@@ ated , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be demonstrated in a blood flow of at least 10 ml .
in order to dimin@@ ish the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis , are not included in the pl@@ asma @-@ aber@@ ration which are no more than 12 donations , or other methods to apply the well @-@ known this danger in a similar way .
one of the liquid amount from which one went out in the manufacture of pl@@ asma , appropriate water supply ; the substance must be fully resolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 ° .
