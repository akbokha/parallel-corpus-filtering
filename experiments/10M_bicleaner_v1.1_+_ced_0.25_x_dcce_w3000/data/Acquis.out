C ) leaves nuclear material , suitable for composition and pur@@ ity for fuel oil production or the process phase , in which it is produced , or will be implemented in a later phase of the kernel @-@ containing nuclear material into the states , so it is subject to the other termin@@ ology measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) Con@@ vey@@ ed in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community is subject to conception that the back@@ rest of nuclear material , the backup measures referred to this Convention is not possible or desired , as the organisation and community are relevant to the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The backup measures mentioned in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community will determine practically non @-@ profit .

new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal paragraph of his hammer - and lam@@ b cannot be drag@@ ged through the application of the regulation in co @-@ passion .
to ensure a f@@ law@@ less functioning of the agreement , committed to New Zealand , by providing suitable procedures that the fact that actually carried out the set @-@ down quantity not exce@@ eds .

the Community as@@ sures that New Zealand with this agreement is not to be prevented from using new technological developments and maintain its competitive position on the community market .
should a change of the Off@@ er form as a result of changes in technology and trade will be possible , then the two Parties shall consult each other before introducing such a change in the cl@@ ause 10 , to find a proper solution .
in the event that the community particip@@ ates the cl@@ ause in demand , it is obliged to protect themselves from this agreement in the New Zealand &apos;s interests .

when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand changes the community in cl@@ ause 2 fixed amounts corresponding to the scope of New Zealand &apos;s trade with each new Member State .

containers and inf@@ usion devices are equipped in front of the shipping with an in English and French label , which corresponds to the model contained in the units 2 to 10 with this protocol .
human whol@@ eness may only be sent to containers in which the temperature can be held throughout the entire tran@@ sports to 4 C to 6 C .
the preparations mentioned in Part II of this protocol and devices must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ o@@ ated and toxic .
it is recommended to add the ship@@ ments needed to inf@@ usion necessary devices as well as the sol@@ vent for dry signs .
human perfection is that a healthy person is mis@@ nom@@ able and mixed blood with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose blood .
C ) who are not free from blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical research and sick@@ ness .
the blood flow occurs as@@ ep@@ tical ; the blood is direc@@ tional through a closed , ster@@ iles tube into a ster@@ ile bottle , into which the anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ si@@ zing solution was frozen in front of the ster@@ il@@ isation .
after completion of the ble@@ eding , the bottle is immediately visible and cool at a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . after that , they may only be opened immediately before the use of blood .
Men@@ zel must not exceed 220 ml per liter of human blood , and the hem@@ p bin@@ ary concentration may not exceed 97 g per liter .
the blood @-@ group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously on hand the blood cell and the ser@@ um to determine ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by exam@@ ining the blood cell on a new sample of the calendar .
as far as required for the blood @-@ group@@ age in individual countries gen@@ or@@ m@@ ed or recommended procedures are applicable .
the name R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific studies have sur@@ rendered to non @-@ invent@@ ories of the anti@@ gens C , D , You and E .
the blood @-@ based on this agreement should only be used for benefici@@ aries of the respective AB @-@ 0 group .
the human full blu@@ t is protected in ster@@ ile , fixed bottle in front of micro@@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary times to be allowed to cool at the maximum of 30 minutes , to cool down the blood instantly at 4 to 6 C .
a concentr@@ ates of human red blood cells is a unity of human full@@ ness , from which the largest part of the pl@@ asma was removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood @-@ body components can be present or may be partially removed .
the hydr@@ ation content of the concentr@@ ates consists of either the rest of pl@@ asma or from an appropriate isot@@ onic artificial artificial solution that was assigned to the removal of the pl@@ asma .
the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approxim@@ ate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ vol@@ um@@ ens ( hem@@ at@@ oph@@ rit ) on the label .
all processes required for the process required must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the treat@@ ise must be carried out under the use of a ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by printing .
is an artificial hydr@@ ated solution added , so is on the label even their volume and composition .
the human dry pl@@ asma is obtained by de@@ hydr@@ ation of fluid , which sets itself up at the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge or se@@ di@@ mentation of human blood blu@@ ts .
the human dry pl@@ asma is won through refriger@@ ation or any other method by avoiding den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins .
the dry product can be easily dis@@ solved in a water supply which corresponds to the liquid height from which one went in the making of the substance .
the concentration @-@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of the so @-@ called solution must not be less than 45 g per lit@@ ers , and the solution must not be a visible sign of h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ se@@ products .

if pl@@ asma was not mixed and frozen not within 48 hours of blood flow and frozen , ster@@ ility of each unit must be proven in a blood flow of at least 10 ml .
to switch to the dam@@ aging effect of the bacterial products in pl@@ asma , blood sp@@ ice , the signs of a bacterial contamin@@ ated , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be demonstrated in a blood flow of at least 10 ml .
in order to dimin@@ ish the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation h@@ epatitis , are not included in the pl@@ asma @-@ aber@@ ration which are no more than 12 donations , or other methods to apply the well @-@ known this danger in a similar way .
one of the liquid amount from which one went out in the manufacture of pl@@ asma , appropriate water supply ; the substance must be fully resolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 Â° .
a given quantity of pl@@ asma is dis@@ solved in the water @-@ quantity which has been produced from which it was produced , the solution will under@@ go the following tests :
II ) one sets out 1 ml solution to an adequate amount of thy@@ ro@@ de or calcium chlori@@ de , so is head@@ quar@@ tered ; the process can be acceler@@ ated at the fraction at 37 C .
through the 24@@ stu@@ en@@ dium drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ tox@@ an at a maximum of 0.@@ 02 mm , a weight loss may not occur with the human dry pl@@ asma weight loss over 0.5 % .
human dry pl@@ asma is located in a nit@@ rogen atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms , and by chance of all moisture to store ; it is before light to protect and at a temperature below 20 Â° .
human Alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from human pl@@ asma @-@ rot@@ eins are preparations of the protein compos@@ ing , consisting of about 60 % of the total prot@@ ru@@ ination of the pl@@ asma of the human body .
regardless of whether the end product is flu@@ ci@@ ble or dry , the preparation must be heated after the add@@ itive of a suitable stabili@@ zer in the final tank 10 hours long to 60 Â° Â± 0.5 C to in@@ activ@@ ating the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ h@@ epatitis .
in preparation for human Alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins have to be Alb@@ um@@ in .
in both compounds there are no more than 10 mg immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ in G per gram of the product .
if the end product is free@@ zing , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product .
if the Group made of human pl@@ aster map@@ le is established as a solution , it must exhibit a total pro@@ clam@@ ation between 45 and 50 g per liter .
