it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg of tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve themselves in the mouth ) , as a solution to income ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. ent@@ res thinking and Spe@@ aking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ ulator ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic illness , in which the patients are man@@ ic episodes ( period ab@@ normal up@@ set ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe Man@@ ical episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the inj@@ ecting solution is applied to the fast control of stag@@ gering un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the medicine is impossible .
with both diseases , the solution for one or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets can be applied to which the lo@@ gs of tablets are prepared .
in patients who take other medicines , which are as likely as abili@@ fy , should be adapted the dose of abili@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. the chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably appears as a &quot; particip@@ ant ag@@ onist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , in order to activate the recept@@ ors .
da d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin at schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder has a role to norm@@ alize Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , elimin@@ ating psych@@ ot@@ eric or man@@ ic symptoms and re@@ occur to re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy , to prevent the re@@ occur of symptoms , was investigated in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or similar disorders , which are an equ@@ itable un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , abili@@ fy over twelve weeks of 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that were re @-@ occur to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy inj@@ ection solution was compared in a study in 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that could be addressed by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the modification of patients were examined by a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment .
the company also introduced studies to investigate how the body produce the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets and the solution to import .
in the two studies with the injection trig@@ gering , the abili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced un@@ eas@@ iness than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
when applying the bi@@ polar disorder , abili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies are more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented until 74 weeks of effective as plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occur medical episodes used in previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administ@@ ered .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg dos@@ ed also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms stolen and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of abili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale disorders ( obs@@ cur@@ ity ) , pur@@ ity , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , pur@@ ity , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abili@@ fy during the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia and in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly some man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes involved in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , facing the risks .
in addition , the Committee reached the outcome that the benefits of inj@@ ecting un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to over@@ lay the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of abili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients showing the predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol . ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
a more incl@@ ined effectiveness in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients achieved over 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initi@@ al@@ osis , if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Indu@@ tor is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ izi@@ d@@ alem behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and in some cases reported after the start or change of a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see Section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder does not have an increased su@@ icide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ ic@@ ular disorders , sti@@ pul@@ mon@@ ary diseases , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .

if in a with abili@@ fy patients are signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ig@@ onic an@@ esth@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or a clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including abili@@ fy , will be set .
that is why Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with cr@@ amps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with states that are used with cr@@ amps in cases , with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol associated with patients with psych@@ oses which were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a increased ster@@ is@@ risk compared to the plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted fe@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ts events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol responsible patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ azi@@ dose or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk ass@@ essm@@ ents for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related un@@ unwanted events involving abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , to allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , Poly@@ uri@@ e , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values .
a weight gain is generally considered in schizop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ pol@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , which is gaining weight as a side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol based on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or any other central effective pharmac@@ euticals as en@@ coding as en@@ coding ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ prot@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a stomach acid @-@ blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , although this effect is not considered to be clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy subjects , an highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) die AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isation can be the common use of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher pl@@ asma @-@ cent@@ red reflec@@ tions compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isation .
if you consider the joint gift of Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy , the potential benefits should prevail over the patient &apos;s potential risks .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV protein inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
according to dis@@ ruption of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised by abili@@ fy on the Dos@@ age before the start of the dental therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ tract D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered with abili@@ fy , can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic mechanism of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ mor@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should get advised to notify their physician when they are pregnant or may plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the insufficient data base on humans and because of the concerns , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are legally determined the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including strength vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than below plac@@ ebo or were classified as potential medic@@ ally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of down@@ side effects is defined following the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study on patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 57,@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS rose 14.@@ 8 % in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .

in a different study conducted over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lith@@ ium treatment .
during the long @-@ time period , more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo on those potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed by no medic@@ ally important differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine phosph@@ ate phosph@@ ate ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of the patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.@@ 0 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo
among the adverse reactions , which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their appearance also reported during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , include the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ al syndrome and increased ster@@ ility at older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ intended or int@@ enti@@ onal rend@@ itions with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death succ@@ ession .
while there is no information on the effectiveness of a her@@ al@@ ese with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol before the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol before ; it is unlikely that the cat@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits is , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has high pl@@ asma @-@ rotation .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during schizop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors will be taught .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ ors for the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for the ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 no@@ rep@@ ine and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled spa studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schizop@@ hr@@ an patients with positive or negative symptoms show Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically enhanced bet@@ tering of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled trial was a week 52 of the proportion of Respon@@ sibility patients who held a response to study media , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from Mess@@ ped@@ als , which were defined as secondary study programmes , including a PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants rates , showed a significant greater improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizop@@ hr@@ enia showed a significant reduction in backward rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % less than plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study was involved with schizop@@ hr@@ enia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the exp@@ iry patient data sets ) in significant less patients a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the output ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , at the 460 women attended with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine earlier .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with that of a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el on drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall speaking in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicines .
considering the patients were treated only for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of efficacy studies such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival no difference between drugs .
against this , in contrast , patients had received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el condition medicine .
it may also not be used in patients who have breast@@ feed or prior to treatment of low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ pay in the blood .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) announced that the first treatment could no longer attack , effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicines was and that it has to be given in contrast to other p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el pharmac@@ euticals have to be given to other medicinal drugs .

Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect transportation and the ability to use machines .
following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects , performed in 229 patients with metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ Car@@ cin@@ oma performed in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical stage III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most remarkable important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ie was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( HB &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( HB &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the formation of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indications performed in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed of a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also contains the same substance ( also &quot; reference framework &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood levels , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur if prior to the procedure a self @-@ blood circulation is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is shown for the drug .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood sp@@ ess@@ ness , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ en@@ amed into a v@@ ein .
inj@@ ecting can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received reasonable guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients who have received chemotherapy , hem@@ ost@@ asis must always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron @-@ values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron gel consists , and iron supple@@ mentary should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment .
in patients who have received chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems can be an a@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ gel or so that the body does not sufficiently respond to the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used in operations to increase the number of the red blood cells , and thus reduce the consequences of a blood@@ shed .
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which they considered the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference framework .
all patients participating in this study had been m@@ apped by at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they were either introduced to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the ha@@ em@@ plate between the beginning of the study and the jud@@ gement period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study , in which the effects caused by E@@ pre@@ x / Tit@@ yp@@ o were examined by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ atic values of patients who were directed to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to that , patients continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output from 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symp@@ tom of one en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , mig@@ rat@@ ory head@@ aches and turbul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or any other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are required to make sure that this triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that provides the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for medical pract@@ ition@@ ers in all member States Information packages , including information on the safety of the drug .

the second study embr@@ aced 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , recently suffered a hip replacement ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
main indicator for the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ is in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me , which is built norm@@ alized ) in the blood or by at least 75 % compared to the base .
in the study involving older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rac@@ ers in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta or other oste@@ opor@@ osis is reduced over a period of three years compared to patients in plac@@ ebo by 70 % .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip re@@ fr@@ actions was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with a fr@@ actions 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta appear within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent during repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ or , patients at A@@ cl@@ asta we@@ ed the risk of kidney failure , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( de@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides evidence material available to physicians for the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients to use in which the drug &apos;s side effects are explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months studies .
after 6 months , a similar reduction of pain and pain re@@ bel has been observed in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ dence at the end of the sixth trial ( on the therapy ) were to be included in an follow @-@ up phase .

unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes constant inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients sei@@ zed the following pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently .
then the pl@@ asma dive swi@@ f@@ tly cut down on &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 h , and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the peak .

in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of administ@@ ered dose is in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains in@@ influenced by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( pl@@ asma @-@ cent@@ ation against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ aus met@@ abolic substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans and because they are a sh@@ aking or even no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent In@@ hibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R available to the public This document is a summary of the European Public Policy Committee ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies carried out by the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to make recommendations concerning the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It may be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( an di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) is not shown together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it may also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted by met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ p@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ p@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant and ins@@ ulin may be maintained at the beginning of Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant and ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s body is better utilized , and the blood sugar levels can be improved , thus making type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes can be better set .
with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ y has been studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ p@@ yl@@ lab@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lo@@ wering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar intake of the application of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lo@@ wer@@ ed .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ y study , the effect of the additional gift from accounts to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ p@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ingredient in lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0,94 % , while the extra gift of plac@@ ebo led to a decrease of 0,35 % .
in a small study , examined the combination of ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients , the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared with 0,@@ 14 % for 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain increase and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ishing sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must neither be used in patients , which might be possibly hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , still in patients with liver issues , con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic Ket@@ o@@ azi@@ ah ( high ket@@ on@@ levels - Inf@@ id@@ ar ) - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in context of a mon@@ otherapy is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment of met@@ form@@ in patients with which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .

the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age are not available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are threatened by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier coron@@ ary heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose steps .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and oils , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disorder has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of her@@ nia suff@@ iciency , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased use @-@ living @-@ enzy@@ me ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the norm@@ sector ) or with other signs of a liver illness may not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel are raised up to the 3 @-@ times of the upper border of the Stand@@ ing area , the liver ch@@ enz@@ ym@@ ers are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient develops symptoms , to point out on a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as uns@@ ett@@ led nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , dra@@ in@@ it@@ ess@@ ness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ me to review .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be led to the pre @-@ delivery of the clinical assessment by the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be st@@ ems from obesity and in some cases with a liquid ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ p @-@ cut came under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the medium @-@ level reduction ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.4 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative control studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ at@@ op@@ bin@@ s by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ at@@ op@@ bin@@ s by 1 @-@ 2 % and the ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .

patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants pregnancy or it occurs , the treatment is res@@ orting ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ ology or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , al@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

when taking the reported top dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days stood no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ oxide Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which results in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat and sk@@ elet@@ on muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ produktion in the liver and boo@@ sts the periph@@ eral fortune in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was tested in total 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can produce no ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use ins@@ ulin effectively .
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , which clearly clar@@ ified that the blood sugar levels were similar to a different Human@@ ins@@ ulin gene .
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should be adjusted when it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the full list is the package of package to be found ) .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) joined the conclusion that the advantages of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes is over@@ ed to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission divided the European Commission to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for appro@@ vals from Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an throughout the European Union .
mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a quick initi@@ ate effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the inj@@ ections must leave at least 6 seconds long under the skin to make sure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar is clearly improved by an increased ins@@ ulin therapy , can notice the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia test@@ ers symp@@ tom changes and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic , long acting ins@@ ulin ( ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin gene ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to ins@@ ulin types ) can cause that a change in dosage is required .
when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in patient can be a dosage adjustment , it can be necessary in the first d@@ osing or in the first few weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic response occurred according to a change of animal on human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia was less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous ins@@ ulin .
travelling over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to pick up the Council of his physician , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals have to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore must consider possible interactions in the therapy and his patients always ask for some other medicines .
4 So@@ likely hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia that can occur in a not adequ@@ ately controlled de@@ activation therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fruit to@@ d in uter@@ o .

disorders of the nervous system occasionally - Peri@@ ph@@ onic neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are deemed acute sc@@ europ@@ athy and usually rever@@ sible .

in the first study had 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who captured A@@ den@@ uri@@ c in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients who once participated in 120 mg once daily , for the last three measurements a Har@@ ns@@ stu@@ zumab in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was about 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea , rash and ab@@ normal liver values .
especially in patients with cardi@@ op@@ tics in the pre@@ history , potentially also a higher risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) joined the conclusion that A@@ den@@ uri@@ c was more effective in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ p Se@@ aling occurs after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney patients , the effectiveness and safety have so far been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people there are no experience in children and young people , the use of Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .

cardiovascular diseases in patients with local heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency is not recommended treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ p @-@ saving drugs , it can come during the treatment course to a acute g@@ ich@@ tan@@ ker because by lo@@ wering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ p Fin@@ ken@@ ess first to be mobili@@ zed in the tissues in the tissue .

liver disease Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of the phase 3 were moderate up@@ grades for liver functioning in patients with Feb@@ ne@@ op@@ at to be observed ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver treatment before the beginning of the Feb@@ ur@@ res treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical finding a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) .

at Pro@@ b@@ anden , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times are associated with an increase in Feb@@ ne@@ gr@@ at@@ ex@@ position ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 @-@ shirts is not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events .

the data collected in two years collected data from the open renewal of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 a treatment against a layer ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients no treatment needed against a layer ) .
this has been associated with a reduction of lamin@@ ate size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the cast@@ ers up to month 24 .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disorder , where the bones are bre@@ wed ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D levels exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking , or take other medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take place until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separate from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are authorised in the European Union , put the company data presented from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D mirror .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients had a lower vitamin D mirror with patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who took only al@@ end@@ ron@@ at only ( 32 % ) .
the company also put the data that in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE contained Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at &apos;s dose is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal muscle , fl@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( disorder ) , sp@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( no@@ der@@ ive ) , sp@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( bal@@ c@@ era ) , sp@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( bal@@ c@@ era ) of sp@@ ices , dy@@ spher@@ es ( lo@@ wer@@ der ) , so@@ b@@ eben@@ es ab@@ dom@@ en ( infl@@ ated tum@@ my ) as well as su@@ res up .
in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
it must not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
cap@@ sul@@ ated , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a fem@@ ur on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first eating , beverage or import of medicines ( including Ant@@ azi@@ da , calcium and vit@@ amin@@ supplements ) for the day .
the following critics are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ able irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is to be lu@@ cked according to the day , only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not let the tablet or tablet in the mouth . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which shall take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. Cor@@ ep@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tra@@ kt except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can be given only in particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ero@@ dium , rarely followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Stri@@ k@@ turen , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly , this serious , and required a hosp@@ it@@ ein@@ formation ) .
the doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible mal@@ op@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ spher@@ es , pain at lo@@ wering or retro@@ fit , pain or new or even wor@@ sen@@ ing of so@@ d@@ burn the medicine to fetch and medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ oph@@ age@@ able side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine properly and / or it depends on symptoms associated to a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is important that all doses can be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large , clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , were rare ( after market launch ) Mag@@ s- and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe , and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether or not the query of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment for patients who need a ki@@ ant surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis .
clinical evaluation by identifying doctor is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take the tablet of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after they noticed their om@@ issions .
they should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking away from one tablet a week as originally planned on this week@@ day .
other diseases which can affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be dealt with before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at Food and Drink ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ azi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients need to wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific inter@@ ac@@ tional studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials along with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ depen@@ dencies .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applicable during pregnancy nor tac@@ tical women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at can be no indication of directly compens@@ atory effects in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the Ki@@ ef@@ ers was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ aten ; most of the reports come from cancer victims , but was also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , withdraw@@ als of the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - Ph@@ osph@@ ats to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 0,65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .

compared to the plac@@ ebo group the group has been reduced by 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to plac@@ ebo 6.@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more sp@@ inning ro@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the cir@@ cus of the BM@@ D of vert@@ eb@@ ral and Tro@@ chan@@ ters continue to be ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ eb@@ oc@@ en@@ rol@@ ed studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily amount of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age reduced the appearance of at least a new sp@@ ine fr@@ ine around 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
Res@@ or@@ tion related to a intra@@ ven@@ ous reference , the mean bi@@ enni@@ al bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0,64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nour@@ ish fasting and two hours before taking a standardi@@ zed breakfast .

9 Distribution Studies in rats has revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at were distributed to intra@@ ven@@ ous ch@@ asing of 1 mg / kg temporarily into Wei@@ ght@@ ens , but then quickly spread in the bones or eliminated with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , approximately 50 % of the radi@@ o@@ active marked substance within 72 hours with urine , and little or no radi@@ o@@ activity was re @-@ found in the subjects .

characteristics in patients of pre@@ clinical trials have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at which is not being depos@@ ited in the bones , quickly passed over the urine .
although there is no clinical data about it , it is nonetheless reck@@ oned that the ren@@ al Eli@@ mination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at like in the animals are also reduced to patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore in patients with reduced kidney function a somewhat increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in the bones are expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ ts had been min@@ ted after a total treatment duration of a year ( by acting for example , how often a renewed organic transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .

as a result of an conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical and appropriate dosage adjustment has to be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic ex@@ position of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be preserved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of sto@@ cking and compatibility in individual and on blood levels ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ommen@@ d@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;

dosage : conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be a transplan@@ t from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , this conversion in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire day dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a shift from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily must start treatment with each one in kidney and liver transplan@@ t for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ ts .
heart transplan@@ t for adult patients who are placed on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,15 mg / kg / day once a day .
other transplan@@ ts , though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f at lung , pan@@ cre@@ atic and rectal cancer , occurred in a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day and in the oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in the intest@@ inal Initi@@ al dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function f@@ ur maintain levels of blood levels in the stri@@ pped area can be needed in patients with severe liver functioning a her@@ ab@@ oration of the dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function As the kidney function has no influence on the pharmaceutical os@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it cannot be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , however , there is a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ t@@ aging levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ clear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) .
conversion from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the conversion of a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the Tal@@ ents in full bloody The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of sto@@ cking and compatibility in individual cases under pressure @-@ related of full bloody Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ spiegel controls .
it is recommended that frequent controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ spiegel during the first two weeks of a transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ o@@ dical controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ ity of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant therapy or at equivalent application of substances that could change the tac@@ tic blood @-@ blood con@@ centric , see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State entered .
the data in clinical studies allow that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the slow@@ ing in the blood 20 ng / ml can not exceed .
in clinical practice the incidence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and n@@ ish - and heart @-@ controlled patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , tend to use blood con@@ centric in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts and other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ tical formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; transform@@ ations of the formulation or the ré@@ g@@ ime should only be carried out under the tigh@@ ter control of one in the transplan@@ t medical ers ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which proved to other immune @-@ supp@@ ress@@ ants , are still not clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed phrase Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ ts at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in the cinema are not yet clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed phrase Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to possible interactions formed to a de@@ composition of the tac@@ tic levels in blood and a ton@@ ing of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plan@@ ters during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentr@@ ations offered in the blood , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations among those circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , he was able to observe as a Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ y , or Sept@@ em@@ y hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur in Adv@@ ant@@ ra@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver functioning , infections , liqui@@ ds over@@ load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants the effect of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin change by suitable clothing or using a heat using a high degree of protection .
if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus assume symptoms for PR@@ ES like head@@ aches , changed consciousness , cr@@ amps and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g ) .
da Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f carbide , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , lact@@ ose included , is available in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ose @-@ lack or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ en@@ particular caution .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus increase the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - blood levels can change during a tempor@@ al gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose to maintain even@@ ly concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been made with anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory drugs such as Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ vor@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ id Anti@@ biot@@ ic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ru@@ ction .
Phar@@ mo@@ genic studies have reported that the increase in blood levels primarily from the elevated bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal verse .
high @-@ quality Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on how it is used for acute wast@@ ed action , can increase or cut concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can set the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thus increase the hor@@ monal im@@ position is made especially careful when making decisions more recep@@ tive .
the results of animals have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pen@@ to@@ bar@@ bit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their semi @-@ value .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immune @-@ supp@@ ress@@ ants a increased risk to unwanted events relating to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o ex@@ position , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns apply to any det@@ ri@@ mental effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular in terms of its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
there is the risk of an early birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ communic@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. ,

L@@ ung@@ king transplan@@ t In a inter@@ analysis on a recent , multi@@ centr@@ alised study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported on 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in .
also a chronic transplan@@ ts , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis ob@@ liter@@ ary syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) .

Adv@@ ate is used for treating and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditioned , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ umps ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether Adv@@ ates are applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack of what blood@@ stream problems like ble@@ eding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human pl@@ asma , but according to a method which is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell to which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which they make up to the formation of the human body factor VIII .
Adv@@ ates is another in the European Union approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , however , is otherwise produced , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical interventions .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ oc@@ ate in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood @-@ se@@ ho@@ iso@@ forms awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; well . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ates ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ates may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human bar@@ rack factor VIII , Maus@@ - or ham@@ ster protein or any other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval of the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved a permit for the transport of Adv@@ ent in the whole of the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity cycle of the factor VIII deficiency , after the settlement and the extent of the blood and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following here@@ tical events , the factor VIII activity in the relevant period should not cut under the specified pl@@ asma @-@ asp@@ ar ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .

if the expected factor VIII pl@@ asma activities cannot be achieved or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to detect a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII treatment is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be explored .

December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited announces the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company assumes its application for approval for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , are the breast , the brain , the bones , or the whit@@ esp@@ aces ( tissues , the other structures in the body connecting , surrounds and rests ) of it .
it is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified that it can wear a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there can be no copies of itself , and thus can not trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been sent directly into the tum@@ ors and thus to allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , formed by the def@@ ective in the human body , is usually formed to restore damaged DNA and to ab@@ out@@ kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein has not been properly , and the canc@@ er@@ ous cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study involving a patient at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the underground , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP received the answers of the company on the questions asked questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on testing the initial submitted documents created the CH@@ MP on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors will bring advantages to the patient .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the way of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficient to be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company not acknowledged the CH@@ MP , whether or not the reverse consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed agents &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours .
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay drops , caused by a all@@ ergy to pol@@ len prot@@ ru@@ des inflammation of the nose @-@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al s@@ skin @-@ sw@@ elling ( hidden n@@ oses ) .
in adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina@@ ze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ eim@@ haut ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed by the sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective structure were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms that were reported by patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the trial the patients associate their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , as difficult to symptoms over the last 12 hours .
in considering all h@@ ay symp@@ tom symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ina@@ ze received , about a decrease of the symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35,@@ 9 % in patients who took p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ eim@@ haut , patients showed a alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms around 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in the patient who captured des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cardi@@ op@@ acity ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( appeal , fatigue ) , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , ins@@ om@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may be used in patients , which might possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against no@@ rep@@ ens agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not being applied .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( increased blood pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or already have a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ( caused by brain disorder ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared an approval for the marketing of Aer@@ ob@@ bin throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without cr@@ acking it or to ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze should be applied in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on inf@@ ancy and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after oral symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the time of application to 10 days , since in long @-@ term use the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take in time .
after decl@@ ining the sw@@ elling of the veil@@ ed in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine than mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ ina@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ tic activity in combination of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ uri@@ d , cab@@ bage , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other Dek@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , Phen@@ olic , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , Phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient , and the data does not suff@@ ice to send corresponding recommendations to dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver functioning , and the data does not suff@@ ice to send corresponding recommendations to dosage .
patients must be notified that the treatment in the appearance of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ the or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or any w@@ ai@@ ds other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ ache ) must be set .
in the treatment of the following patient groups to be advised : • patients suffering from digital arr@@ hyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a M@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ market in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder removal or bron@@ chit@@ is in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to implementing the mat@@ ological testing , as anti @-@ hist@@ amine can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for Hau@@ ts actions or to reduce their extent .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered however , were not observed a clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the pl@@ asma @-@ centr@@ ation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ical tests could not be found significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzy@@ me responsible for Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Enzy@@ m has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ concei@@ vable of the use of aer@@ ina@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to incidence of normal population .
since the reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ quer@@ or features of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .

for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by the change of symptoms ( itch , number and size of the p@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep , and the performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was determined .
there were further studies submitted to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for one and use the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been summar@@ ised , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us became an average absorption of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , to lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any other ingredients .
January 2001 , the European Commission shared an approval for the Transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet every day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
it has limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine for young people aged from 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous illness seeker and can be completed after the sound of symptoms and can be re @-@ absorbed in their re @-@ emergence .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms over 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during all@@ ergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been found in the framework of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during tempor@@ al intake of alcohol and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be noted , however , that in very rare cases it may come to prosec@@ ution , which may lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic ; or the ability to use machines .
clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly applied side effects , which was more common than in plac@@ ebo , fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ aches , these occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , in which to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ ched clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ pag@@ or@@ ical cycles such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesive @-@ ol@@ ek@@ ül@@ s P @-@ Sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells .
as part of a clinical trial with multi@@ disciplinary , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 mg per day , was dos@@ ed not statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the neo @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was dos@@ ed over ten days prior to the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
with an dos@@ dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg not any influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective sle@@ ep@@ iness or the tasks that are connected to the finger .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was performed in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z the nose , it@@ ching and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the appearance of symptoms over 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as based on the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively sh@@ red@@ ded by seasonal rhin@@ itis frag@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine was investigated for further forms of adju@@ sts , since the underlying path@@ physi@@ ology is similar in the ae@@ ology at different forms and chronic patients can be implemented more easily prospec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine is a caused factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected in the chronic idi@@ opathic urine , in other forms of adju@@ sts to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic prim@@ ti@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and her@@ ing of size and number of p@@ add@@ ling at the end of the first dos@@ ages .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine was the minority of the patients who are not on anti @-@ hist@@ amine , from the study .
an improvement in the hur@@ ricane of more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the growth @-@ being significant , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a phar@@ yn@@ the@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis Rhin@@ itis , was achieved at 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no instructions for a clin@@ ically important cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , that is responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Enzy@@ m but was not yet identified , so that interactions with other drugs will not be entirely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ co@@ red .
in an individual dos@@ ed study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg . meals ( fet@@ ish , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) is not made on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical studies performed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine performed at a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity Prof@@ iles of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and to Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin .

clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ depen@@ dencies were not found in the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced during a while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall pre@@ valence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
when clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic urine , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study by adults and juven@@ iles , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ ched clinical dose ) were administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , given for an anti@@ hist@@ amine work , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 to 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic urine and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is similar in adults and children , the efficacy data from des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be used in adults to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multi @-@ specialist in adults and teenagers , used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days has not been statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study conducted by adults and young people , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the neo @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls .
in controlled clinical trials was determined at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young people no increased incidence of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. dem Committee on Human phar@@ yn@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) officially declar@@ ing that the company takes its application for approval for the prevention of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 Inf@@ lu@@ enza by adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of Inf@@ lu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a flu breaks off if a new trunk of influ@@ x virus emerging , which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus as &quot; physical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body @-@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the immune system will later be able to make a contact with a grip @-@ virus that stem faster anti@@ body .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus is used with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ alien ) , and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study had not been conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not out to comply with the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP opinion , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years involving human immune virus @-@ virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is causing acquired the acquired immune syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase faces as a solution to income , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered when the doctor has checked which anti@@ vir@@ al medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that the virus is to be listened to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is directed after the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase is reduced in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines that HIV @-@ quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS do not cure , however , may not delay the damage of the immune system , and thus also the development of associated infections and disorders .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , however without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously had not been treated with the release .
this with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared to 206 adults , which had previously been prot@@ ru@@ ed to the former prot@@ ru@@ ms .
primary indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ breaking concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the vir@@ al load after treatment .
in trials of patients who had previously had no prototype were reported after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a vir@@ al load below 400 copies / ml than in plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase was also the vir@@ al load , however treated by the children who were previously treated with the release of the treatment previously .
in the study involving adults , which were treated earlier with the release which had been treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ weekly treatment as effective as other proteins
in patients with HIV , which was drug @-@ resistant against four other proteins , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the vir@@ al last after four weeks as with the patients who reported their previous pro@@ clam@@ ation previously :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , fl@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against fac@@ eh@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase should also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant ( herbal supplements for treating depression ) or medicines that are as well as A@@ gener@@ ase and are considered to be harmful in high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs against HIV , A@@ gener@@ ase are taking the risk of a dual @-@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body tissues ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ om@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the reco@@ vering immune defence ) .
the Committee on Human Development ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ov@@ in@@ ic ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been unable to have a prototype .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission holding the Bu@@ ax@@ o Group Limited announces its approval for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , proteins and children aged 4 and older .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules to be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ ov@@ in@@ tic boo@@ st@@ ination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al resistance cl@@ sters and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ eli@@ av@@ r as a solution for income is 14 % lower than capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for income are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase is applied without the intensi@@ fying add@@ itive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
phar@@ yn@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of an@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on inf@@ ancy and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the phar@@ yn@@ the@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with medium @-@ tough@@ er liver functioning on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functioning on 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or moderate life @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may contain , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and are treated with a anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver ju@@ ices with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including a chron@@ ically @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased frequency of liver functioning under a anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ism or other gl@@ uc@@ oc@@ or@@ oids , which weighs over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment is over@@ due to system@@ ic cor@@ tical @-@ effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ depend@@ ed and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction of Hem@@ mer Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended a simultaneous administration of vas@@ cul@@ ase , lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , methods are available to determine the drug con@@ centric .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective for a decreased pl@@ asma @-@ asp@@ ar of am@@ eli@@ av@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r can be altered the effectiveness of hor@@ monal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
because of the possible risk of a tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ cer@@ ation of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for income , this is contrac@@ ted by children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the v@@ eil @-@ skins are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including prototyp@@ ing , was reported via the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exception of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , their therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .

with HIV infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ect can develop a inflammat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical condition or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ tual ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy body @-@ measure index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width is not given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which have minimal therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with pharmac@@ euticals whose active ingredients are primarily changed over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated for the increased pl@@ asma bri@@ cks with severe and / or life @-@ threatening adverse effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logic failure and lead to a resistance development .
at the attempt , which hum@@ ili@@ ated pl@@ asma @-@ asp@@ ed by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed unwanted effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ hable ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ spiegel of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degrad@@ able by the simultaneous application of herbal plu@@ gs ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already refers to cur@@ rant , the pay@@ load , and , if possible , the vir@@ al load is to review and set the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered along with pay@@ avi@@ r ( see also van@@ f@@ avi@@ o lower ) .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max on the other hand by 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with pay@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and uncertainty of this treatment schem@@ ata .
52 % lower when pay@@ load ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min value of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg / opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous appointments by Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to a nar@@ rative surveillance as the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ogen@@ etic study conducted using A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to ant@@ acid components of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ o , in combination with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ o in combination with am@@ y@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both proteins might be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other proteins and available data can be pres@@ umed that ne@@ vir@@ ons may susp@@ ect the ser@@ um Con@@ centr@@ ation of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din because of the decreased / or possibly sub@@ therapeutic pl@@ asma may be less effective .
when these drugs are applied collec@@ tively , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of pay@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ pren@@ ate and ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thus to a rise in associated side effects .
if it is required for clinical reasons , re@@ fab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gener@@ ase is advised to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmaceutical chem@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , could be the pl@@ asma @-@ brick of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . a day led to an increase in the C@@ max of Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in pl@@ asma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ balance ) compared to the value , which was observed after 200 mg / ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without a simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs when they are applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may come to res@@ or@@ ption .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , which are known as enz@@ ym@@ eri@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the pl@@ um shaft of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ uted pin , car@@ dio pin , car@@ ot@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by pay@@ av@@ r , causing possibly boo@@ sting the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase considerably and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors to linked side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days passed over , while the endo@@ genous cort@@ is@@ ol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % discount intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended along with these gl@@ uc@@ oc@@ or@@ oids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment exce@@ eds the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical @-@ effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction of inhibit@@ atin such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and cin@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases of pl@@ asma @-@ asp@@ ire while in @-@ time administration .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ ung this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction of inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opath@@ y , including a co@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended .
there will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ zation the mirror , since the pl@@ asma @-@ cent@@ red@@ ness of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at equivalent to am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase should not be applied along with or@@ ally perceived Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while in the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ r@@ ally Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in pl@@ asma @-@ waves of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on administ@@ ered along with Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms of symptoms , especially if there is also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
because of the per se of small reproduction of historical mer@@ it , there is currently no recommendation to be given , such as the pren@@ eur@@ ship &apos;s dose is to be administ@@ ered by meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time .
in a simultaneous engagement of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of dow@@ ning or strengthening of anti @-@ oxid@@ ant effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ monal contrac@@ ep@@ tive practices , therefore , are recommended as alternative methods of contrac@@ eption .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Desi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in a tempor@@ al gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used after pregnancy after careful di@@ lig@@ ation of potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .

the further development of the income , including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproduction , was not affected by the administration of am@@ eli@@ av@@ r to the mother &apos;s mother .
the infin@@ ity of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs .
most of the effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and often led to treatment break@@ down .
in many of these events is not clar@@ ified whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other at the same time to HIV infection treatment , or whether they are a result of under@@ sex diseases .
most of the mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with which accounts for the patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase received twice a day .

cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti @-@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) .
for HIV infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ect can be developed at the time of introduction of anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy ( ART ) an inflammat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .

based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based on Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to estimate the activity of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defined resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / V , I@@ 54@@ A / C / V , I@@ 98@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a fu@@ eled ph@@ onic range with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased probability of vi@@ ro@@ logic response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data and it is advised to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
in the mon@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analyses , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated inter@@ pret@@ ations systems may be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the assessment of the activity of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies to exp@@ el the diagnostic tests , have clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r associate pattern creates a certain cru@@ el resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally remains intact .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and other proteins for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al @-@ treated scheme ( one of which showed a fossil @-@ resistance against at@@ az@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( three of 25 insulation ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insulation ) , Sa@@ iz@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insulation ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insulation ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( four of 24 Isol@@ ati@@ ate ) and ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insulation ) .
in reverse , Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other proteins drug @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in isolation .
the early break @-@ breaking treatment is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within borders , which may affect the following treatment .
the receipt of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nuclear therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with reduced rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; received .
a hundred @-@ six@@ ty @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the participation A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the waste management value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ al load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the Plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ correct wave of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the receipt of the efficacy of un@@ contamin@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving a total of 288 HIV infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase is used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day .
there was no low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI @-@ treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) who administ@@ ered N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a pl@@ asma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during the treatment of therapy with PI pre@@ destined for the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reported &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to maximum ser@@ um concentration of pay@@ load about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule , and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % reduced , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with pay@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pay@@ load 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration at the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake influences the scale and rate of resol@@ ving .
the apparent distribution volume amounts approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ interrupted penetration of pay@@ load of the blood circulation into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in pl@@ asma , whereas the quantity of un@@ mort@@ ally am@@ ity , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ mort@@ ally am@@ ity remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active components at the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that have to indu@@ ce CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , will be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ ate exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
eur@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al feature on the elimination of Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r will be small .
these treatment schem@@ ata are leading to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r pl@@ asma @-@ w@@ elling to those who are obtained on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies to can@@ yon with am@@ ity and rats , occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ epat@@ oc@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome in d@@ osing of d@@ oms ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r , Langu@@ ages .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the origin of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ omas was not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of this observed effects for man is unclear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on the person , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ iz@@ ations tests , the bacterial reverse in reverse tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ sc@@ opes on rats and chromos@@ omes in human periph@@ eral t@@ l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes were neither j@@ av@@ als nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical practice by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ are .
so far in clinical studies have not yet been observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as a result of a age of 4 , showed a high Mort@@ ality with the results of the treatment as well as those with Am@@ pren@@ av@@ r .
for a system@@ ic pl@@ asma @-@ position , the significant among ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected ex@@ position of therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and sli@@ pping sk@@ elet@@ on changes that point out to a delay .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase is applied without the intensi@@ fying add@@ itive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of pay@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be done in patients with weak or easier life @-@ functioning with caution , in patients with severe liver functioning , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and War@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) , methods are available to determine the drug con@@ centric .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms or the v@@ eil @-@ skins are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can cause a vi@@ ro@@ logic failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased for C@@ max on the other hand by 30 % lower when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with pay@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min value of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg / opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered .
a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous appointments by Am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to a nar@@ rative surveillance as the effectiveness and in@@ concei@@ vable of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ o in combination with am@@ y@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the ex@@ position of both proteins might be low .
when these drugs are applied collec@@ tively , caution is offered ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rology monitoring is to be made since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of pay@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients , which may possibly be highly sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , cannot be applied .
the European Drug Research Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to check all new information that may be known , check and update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who are Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the responses to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 the European Commission shared the European Commission Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV . approval for the Transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .

the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inher@@ ited met@@ abolic disease .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient gets it , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the security and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be advised by a d@@ osing scheme .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and for these patients cannot be advised by a d@@ osing scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop infectious @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any relative side effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the mer@@ ged @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be super@@ vised , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical setting , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical stage @-@ 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually form in 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infection @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution when using all@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , has to be careful because of the theoretically increased risk reaction after a inter@@ ruption of the treatment carefully .
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ gens ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ conditioned reactions .
in the case of a slight or moderate inf@@ usion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ ak@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wo@@ unded and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion with which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are dro@@ wned , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is too weak@@ ened .
inf@@ usion can be added with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal @-@ experimental studies cannot be det@@ ri@@ mental or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
because no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated towards Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to breast@@ feeding .
the side effects in clinical trials were obtained mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ conditioned responses that were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study conducted with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medication transactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 - study and its extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following cases : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , moreover , heavy reactions to , including bron@@ chit@@ o , breathing , and facial wr@@ inkl@@ es ( see section 4.4 ) .
children of un@@ solic@@ ited pharmac@@ euticals in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly heavy bur@@ dock and a total treatment duration of up to 12 months , were listed in the table .
intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ver@@ ine version , with the patients at the age of 5 with a heavy conversion form ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature exp@@ elling from the study ) at 13 / 45 patients no radi@@ o@@ immun@@ ized antibodies ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say thought@@ ful antibodies before , including 3 patients , where there was never to ser@@ vo version .
patients with error @-@ up to lower antibodies form a robust reduction in the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low NEU@@ TRA@@ LI@@ Z@@ ING effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ ef@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro , which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug actions , even though the appearance of unwanted pharmac@@ euticals typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ y@@ se of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzy@@ me .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken out of the circulation and recorded by cells into the l@@ ly@@ os@@ omas , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ en@@ rol@@ ed phase @-@ 3 study conducted by 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported by the central phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient dism@@ issed the heavy phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ stic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closure in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - case test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label templates , where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group improving the lung function and the in@@ ability which is shown in the following table .
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage process percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of the children .
of 26 patients with a h@@ epat@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG is seen in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) that remained constant up to the end of the study .
with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous auto@@ immune system between patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes for five efficacy studies , course in the 6 @-@ minutes en@@ test , movement of the deb@@ tor of A@@ HI and visual shar@@ p@@ ness ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ year @-@ 2 study conducted in which primarily the safety and phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined by 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study conducted under 5 years ( 16 patients with heavy loads ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks on 200 e / kg .
in case of multiple patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain increase ( n = 3 ) , after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the moderate ver@@ run@@ down form referred to a normal mental work speed , whereas the older patients with heavy bur@@ dock were limited , or no progress made in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations on pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test were performed .
intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg of intra@@ ven@@ ous every 2 weeks can present in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information , which will evaluate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is being updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study conducted by 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in were treated an average of 12,@@ 1 month , compared to 9,@@ 3 months during the period administration from Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer does not attack the record epi@@ th@@ el@@ ial cells , in administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survi@@ ving times than with the compar@@ ative media .
in September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company El@@ i Lilly ; a permit for the Transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the whole of the European Union .
any blood @-@ bottle has to be revealed with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which gives a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary res@@ h@@ sis is taken from and with 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) on 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in shown to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ cl@@ ine bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in the weighing epi@@ th@@ el@@ ial Hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ os@@ k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ kl@@ ine@@ tic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma except in over@@ care - form@@ ative col@@ th@@ el@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours around 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ specific bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after the previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F can be administ@@ ered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment .
reduction of pre@@ valence and sever@@ ity of skin interactions have to be given the day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed material , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ id .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of P@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid have to be taken and the intake must continue throughout the whole therapeutic dose as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also get a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) within the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed dosage , as well as after any third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed , should every gift created a complete blood image , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ zäh@@ ne .
the al@@ kal@@ ische Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , Asp@@ art@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place under Ber@@ brid@@ ge@@ - rape of the N@@ adi@@ r des blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ table therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degrees 3 ( excluded neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , must be interrupted for the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value prior to the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA needs to be demol@@ ished when in patients after 2 dos@@ ages , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued in the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no evidence that in patients at the age of 65 years , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 is an increased by side @-@ effective risk .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials occurred in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of than 45 ml / min there is no dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver refu@@ elling of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border @-@ value and / or trans@@ amine value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 times of the upper limit ( when the presence of liver metastatic ) is not specifically examined in studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ riages and p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ a.@@ s again is a value of equivalent to 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - enzy@@ me again achieved a value of equivalent to 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ite number , t@@ rom@@ atic number and maxim@@ ally @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity as they observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ine tox@@ icity such as Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ico Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been denied when a pre @-@ treatment had taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 .
therefore all patients should be instruc@@ ted to be dependent on risk @-@ fixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ es@@ y lak@@ ier measure for reduction in action @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium @-@ sized kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ met@@ rology ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , to avoid therapy and min@@ des@@ - after 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , provided for a therapy with P@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existence hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant liqui@@ ds - accumulation in the trans@@ cell@@ ular room a dra@@ in@@ age of taking over the p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed treatment are experienced .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ market , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ary events were reported in clinical trials by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application ad@@ dic@@ ated vital substances ( except yellow fe@@ ver , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) , not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible skull @-@ proof of reproductive @-@ ability caused by p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment reg@@ imen - to pick up consulting with regard to the sperm volume .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ met@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased sh@@ em@@ bo@@ xed fixed extension with the result of a multip@@ ly re@@ occurrence of side @-@ effects .
therefore caution is advis@@ able if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high d@@ osing .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high d@@ osing for at least 2 days prior to therapy , to be avoided two days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
given no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ core elements , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib needs to be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , in therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of t@@ inn@@ ess status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards @-@ Rati@@ o ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ ec@@ ents abol@@ ites are expected in pregnancy severe birth@@ effects .
p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , and after careful di@@ lig@@ ation of the utility for the mother and the risk to the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible complic@@ ation of the reproductive @-@ faculty by p@@ em@@ bo@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment course , advice on the inter@@ ruption of inter@@ vie@@ - .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on gest@@ ed mamm@@ oth can not be ruled out .

Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : for the prevention of acoustic nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy given to cancer of cancer and v@@ om@@ iting with moderate em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy given to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and om@@ iting that is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ bo@@ ating chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding any prior chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ y@@ ant@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nest@@ y ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 prot@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is not able to extend the chron@@ ology of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or with patients in which the Q@@ t@@ - inter@@ v@@ all is extended or the need for such pro@@ long@@ ation .
except in connection with other chemical otherap@@ eu@@ tics division , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy was neither intended to prevention , nor to treat nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies hem@@ m@@ ated Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron failed to in@@ hibit the activity of five car@@ et@@ ted Chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( Cis@@ plat@@ in , Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ etic interaction between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration or@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , of a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ov@@ in@@ etic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ oxet@@ ine , nec@@ id@@ in , Ran@@ iti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ thal@@ ene and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) have no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be used , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is necessary by the treating doctor as necessary .
in clinical studies the most common in a dose of 250 mc@@ g to observed side effects ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly with Alo@@ xi associated with Alo@@ xi related to head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of abundance programs ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar cases of undes@@ irable events like in the other d@@ osing groups ; there were no dose of outcomes to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably does not provide effective therapy in a su@@ icide @-@ assessment .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ placement studies were a total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with &lt; 500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g or 750 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time period 7 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ day 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on Day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ous .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study were a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ et@@ ved chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given to date 1 intra@@ ven@@ ous .
results of the studies with moderate @-@ resistant chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication @-@ in@@ duced sp@@ ill and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ u@@ ous and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block both the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved I@@ on@@ enk@@ ins and extend the duration of the shar@@ eholder .
the aim of the study carried out to 221 healthy subjects of the study was the assessment of E@@ KG @-@ effects of I.@@ V. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ osen of 0,25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ ale lo@@ resc@@ ence of pl@@ asma @-@ centr@@ ations a slow eli@@ mination from the body with an average @-@ dimensional semi @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum pl@@ asma @-@ centric variation ( C@@ max ) and the surface area under the concentration on @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire Dos@@ age range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
according to intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the average daily ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ pl@@ asma @-@ concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
derived from pharmac@@ ov@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that once again reached a full intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron by 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , with which a non @-@ recur@@ ring intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0,75 mg was higher . however , the C@@ max after the acquisition of 0,75 mg was higher .
about 40 % will be eliminated via the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic processes , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies for met@@ abolic devices have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a minor extent , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ ts at healthy , the total @-@ clear@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver functioning the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ tz@@ eit and the average system@@ ic ex@@ position with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction of the dose is however not justified .
clinical trials have been observed only after extru@@ ders who are considered adequate for the maximum human@@ istic exposure , which indicates a little relevance to clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies have cl@@ ues that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron is able to block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ am@@ channels that are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and prolon@@ ging the stock@@ ings duration .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose was given in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic dec@@ eption in man ) who were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly incidence of liver tumor , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin @-@ gates at R@@ atten , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses of met@@ ering and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for the unique application , the relevance of these results is low as low as humans .
the owner of this permit has to appro@@ ve the European Commission on the plans for the transport system in the context of this decision @-@ approved drug use .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the authorisation of the approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C is recommended in the treatment of Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections .
this means that the al@@ eon of a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should resem@@ ble the same phar@@ ma an effective component that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference framework ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long@@ standing ) h@@ epatitis C ( one by bacter@@ al infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue points out , and the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic Al@@ an@@ in@@ - Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been produced , which stim@@ ulated this to the formation of the drug .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon provided data provided by the comparison between Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and pur@@ ity of the drug , impact , safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C ) .
in the study involved in patients with h@@ epatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon with the effectiveness of the reference is compared to 455 patients .
measured in the study , how many patients said after 12 of total 48 therapy weeks as well as 6 months after adjustment of the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document only provided by the E@@ MEA is , What were the biggest concerns that have received the CH@@ MP recommendation to fail to permit permission for the transport system ?
furthermore , concerns were raised that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug can not suff@@ ice by means of the drug .
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C , which said to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon fl@@ ames the disease in more patients than in terms of reference , Alph@@ ons had more side effects .
aside from this , the test was shown in the study to examine the question , in@@ wi@@ ew@@ eit the medication constitutes an immune response ( d. h. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) un@@ solved , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be used to treat be@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation of in@@ coming skin infection ) and small in@@ it@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting @-@ wo@@ unds ) , de@@ ed and se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections , which is det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against these kinds of infections could not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2 % of the surface .
if the patient speaks to the patient after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by block@@ ade the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacter@@ ium in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
primary indicator of the effectiveness happened in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was dis@@ kl@@ ed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.7 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ s@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ alex@@ in similar response : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ s@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups relate to the treatment .
however , in these two studies however , was found that Al@@ tar@@ go has been caused in the treatment of waste ( the crowded cav@@ ities in the body tissues ) or infections , which have been prov@@ oked or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation by the order .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) suggests that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections against the risks are ou@@ tw@@ ined : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ cis@@ ions , de@@ dic@@ ed or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
may 2007 , the European Commission holding the company Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd. set out a permit for travel by Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
the patients in which no improvement within two or three days should be examined , should once again be examined and an alternative therapy is considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the case of a sens@@ it@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by using ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the ano@@ int@@ ment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used for treating infections in which MR@@ SA is known as terrestrial or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary schools , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ent st@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were un@@ insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected body occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the small Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which were obtained upon people after top@@ ical application on the dic@@ ed skin or infected with super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After equal amounts of 2 times a day 200 mg Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle fr@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin s@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on de@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not necessary for required if top@@ ical sa@@ vi@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ tox@@ icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are inadequate in regards to a statement about the birth and the Federal al / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin S@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to present a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding has continued / ended or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go continues to be ended , between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , was the most frequently reported side @-@ effect irrit@@ ation at the ab@@ reich@@ ungs@@ ort , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
it is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( former Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the drug mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective im@@ itation of bacterial prot@@ ections by inter@@ acting on a particular bond of the 50 sub@@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ ellen Ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ der@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P bond , and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ hass@@ ase@@ Centre .

should appear on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms , should be stri@@ ving through expert advice .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isolation were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of no show @-@ speaking on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
absorption in a study with healthy adults was charged 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily on Oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and on the skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days in the top@@ ical treatment of secondary education , individual Plas@@ map@@ ro@@ bs were obtained .
the sam@@ pling took place on days 3 or 4 with adult patients each prior to medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system inclusion involving human beings on a top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 with me@@ ager skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP converter .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ur@@ am@@ ulin in human Leb@@ an@@ mi@@ k@@ ros@@ oma was primarily supported by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , in the lower participation of CY@@ P2@@ X and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral Tox@@ icity at R@@ atten ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within the framework of a two doses of existing vaccines , whereby any protection against Hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is allowed only to be used if the immun@@ ization is a low risk of HC@@ V infection and is ensured that the two doses can end up existing vaccines .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix , or another h@@ epatitis A or B vaccine .
vaccines also function by bringing the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can turn against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix adults and the associated vaccine Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vaccines have to be used to protect the same disease , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix which will be administ@@ ered out of three doses of existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ X adults included identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as a test@@ et for applying Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness has been the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
in an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six@@ teen @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against Hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix which was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , App@@ lic@@ it@@ man@@ gel , pain at the inj@@ ections , red@@ ness , mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as fri@@ ction .
Ambi@@ rix may respond in patients , which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) cannot be applied .
August 2002 , the European Commission divided the company Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire
the standardi@@ zed plan for pri@@ zed and Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , may be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combination of combin@@ ant vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HC@@ V anti @-@ h@@ epatitis Consult@@ ants ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ fung@@ al values are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed up to whether immun@@ o @-@ expert persons , who have addressed a refres@@ hed vaccine as protection , as they may also be protected at no longer det@@ ectable antibodies , possibly by the immune memory .
3 As with all inj@@ ectors , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision always be available immediately .
if a quick protection against Hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation ema is recommended with the Com@@ pression wr@@ inkl@@ es , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ ine h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
with ha@@ yst@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , after prim@@ acy , under certain circumstances , no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
because a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the but@@ to@@ cks could lead to an sub@@ optimal im@@ balance , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or blood @-@ irrit@@ ation , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected however , as in these cases , in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift may come to ble@@ eding .
when Ambi@@ rix starts in the second year in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ ell@@ ul@@ a@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cot m@@ umps @-@ Roman vaccine was administ@@ ered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in case of patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with imm@@ unity , it must be assumed that may not be sufficient immune response .
in a clinical trial that has conducted with 3 vaccines , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ity , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , head@@ ache and fe@@ ver comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administ@@ ered by a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix compared with the 3 @-@ cans of non @-@ recur@@ sive disorder .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and in@@ activity on a calculation base for a vaccine transmission , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain has been observed according to the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the sam@@ pling after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses of non @-@ recur@@ sive disorder .
after the complete vacc@@ ec@@ y@@ cle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects , which had Ambi@@ rix administ@@ ered down over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % at the test subjects who have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ - combination @-@ gland .
however , the incidence of mat@@ activity was comparable to pro Pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vaccine at 39.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans of non @-@ recur@@ ring treatments ) .
the incidence of pre@@ cip@@ ant pain and mat@@ r@@ ity was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination of the drop @-@ in vaccine with the 3 @-@ C@@ ans vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccine , the appearance of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ence was comparable to that in administration with the 3 @-@ C@@ ans @-@ combined h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen observed .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , was a frequent appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ections ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , reported .
the proportion of vaccines that have severe adverse reactions during the 2 cans of vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or during 3 @-@ doses vaccines with the combination of combined h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen , was statist@@ ically different .
in clinical trials that were performed at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years were the Ser@@ o@@ con@@ gest@@ ive rates for Anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 . ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ con@@ versions advise for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 dos@@ ed dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined with three doses .
with the 28@@ 9 people whose imm@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity was dis@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ec@@ ution rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the length of the 3 @-@ dos@@ ages vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ isation , which have been achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old a month after completion of the full vaccines ( i.e. in the month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ C@@ ans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination of combined h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
persons who were at the time of pri@@ mer between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies were shown at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation of Ambi@@ rix which can be demonstrated in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immun@@ o@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that , the resulting after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination of combined h@@ epat@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface anti@@ gen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other paths , such as bathing in waste water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bub@@ bly face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow addiction ) and other symptoms which may possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B , even if the complete vaccine has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ inations , Ambi@@ rix is already infected with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B ( although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) may not prevent a vacc@@ ination a disorder possibly does not prevent .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or symptoms which are similar to those after a h@@ epatitis A or Hepatitis B infection can not be taught .
• if your child has already been an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by ju@@ ck@@ eting skin suggestions , respir@@ ation or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . • if with you / your child has occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against Hepatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • if you have / your child have a serious infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to have fast protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in a possible risk of an infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend you / Your Child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis A vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content on effective inventory is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination before ending the vaccines .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix which suffer from severe blood cl@@ ut@@ ations , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are weak@@ ened to your child due to a condition or treatment in your / his physical error resistance / or if you / your child can under@@ go a roll .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Do you take your doctor if you may use / Your Child further medicines / typ@@ ing ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated with no prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated with without prescription ( antibodies ) or any immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible in various limb@@ s .
if Ambi@@ rix is supposed to be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not administ@@ ered , except it is urgent need to be vacc@@ inated by both h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss an agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
( more than 1 case per 10 contamin@@ ated doses ) : • Pain or discomfort at the st@@ ich@@ ment or red@@ ness • Mat@@ iness • Rei@@ char@@ it@@ ability • Head@@ ache • App@@ lic@@ it@@ man@@ gel
( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ed C@@ ans ) : • sw@@ elling at the inj@@ ections • fe@@ ver ( over 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ ost • gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ail@@ ments
further side effects , the days or weeks after the vacc@@ ination with comparable drop @-@ inf@@ ants against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ver@@ im@@ pf@@ ved doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been announced since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the application , the CH@@ MP opinion is that the benefit risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive .
since Ambi@@ rix is only placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of low patient exposure .
Ammon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with in@@ compl@@ ett@@ ous enzy@@ me or with hyper@@ ammon@@ al en@@ cephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ i@@ ac@@ entri@@ cular ) in the pre@@ history .
Ammon@@ aps is - split into several sub@@ tro@@ users to meals - swal@@ lowed under the food mixed or via an gast@@ ro@@ st@@ cloth ( through the ab@@ dom@@ ic@@ ation in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ onde ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Ammon@@ aps not could be compared to any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a hypo@@ cr@@ ament , i.e. without a substance ) .
Ammon@@ aps can also cause loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , head@@ ache , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ability , irrit@@ ability , om@@ iting , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash , rash or weight gain .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) acted to the conclusion that Ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to be high ammon@@ i@@ ally effectively prevented .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of authorisation only limited information to this medicine .
the use is indic@@ ative in all patients in which a complete en@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine has already manifest@@ ed in the re@@ birth age ( within the first 28 life @-@ days ) .
in patients with a late manifest@@ o form ( in@@ complete end result , which man@@ if@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) then there is a indication of use when an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ op@@ tic cephal@@ opath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with gor@@ ges is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by means of protein ob@@ arbit@@ ration and the development and development necessary for the patient &apos;s development .
after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synth@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ synthe@@ tic def@@ ect must be obtained in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS pills may not be administ@@ ered patients with lo@@ vel@@ s- as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS includes 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or severe ren@@ ame in@@ suff@@ iciency , as well as with so@@ dium and e@@ at@@ ile prevention states only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate has been carried out over the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suff@@ iciency .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a stolen loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delay mat@@ uring of tor@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the lact@@ ation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS entered at 56 % of patients at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events have assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disease , heavy Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ als of neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of an over@@ dose entered at a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with a promised single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ is@@ lat@@ ch neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic connection , which is con@@ ju@@ ated by action with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated via the kid@@ neys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric has seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen glut@@ amine ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be accepted that for each gramm@@ es so@@ dium hydro@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis was posed early and the treatment immediately started to improve the chance of survival and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early @-@ manifest@@ ing form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the ren@@ aissance age was earlier almost always inf@@ ar@@ se , and the illness themselves led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their stu@@ res @-@ free an@@ alogy inside the first life year to death .
through the cat@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ox@@ ic@@ ation ( so@@ dium and so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced costs and so@@ dium of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first living conditions ) of diagnosed with 80 % .
in patients whose disease has been diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ com@@ ic enzy@@ me , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with the time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with bel@@ ated form of the disease ( including feminine patients with the h@@ et@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium cephal@@ opath@@ y and then permanently treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ta and a prot@@ ru@@ ding diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ox@@ i@@ fies to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ scienti@@ fic@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites in pl@@ asma and urine , in so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , the ha@@ em@@ atic metabolism and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts from or@@ alen doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
according to a distinctive single dose of 5 g of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ but@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ion measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been established .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary bladder dysfunction or hem@@ op@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ ally fasting is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the pl@@ asma .
for three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which have repeatedly been treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single pieces ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate conf@@ ec@@ es on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
outlet The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on kid@@ neys of the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ ogen@@ ic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h according to oral administration with a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules is taken either by or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who can not swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with gor@@ ges ) or via an gast@@ ro@@ st@@ yl@@ l@@ auch , or a nas@@ al bl@@ onde .
after the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular , double @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in pl@@ asma should be held within the normal course .
in patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synth@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if R@@ atten@@ de@@ ction were exposed in front of birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain rin@@ de .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) has been reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a met@@ abolic disease , heavy Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , Pan@@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ er@@ als of neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric has seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen glut@@ amine ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of over@@ sight
on the basis of studies on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be pres@@ umed that for each gramm@@ es so@@ dium hydro@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate between 0,12 and 0,15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
according to a prob@@ able single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after in@@ gest@@ ion measurement of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small f@@ po@@ on 0.95 g , the middle bar of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring po@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate .
if a patient has to get the medication on a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing certain live enz@@ ym@@ es , so that they accum@@ ulate the nit@@ rogen waste products that accum@@ ulate after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are made available for laboratories , you have to notify the doctor that you are using AM@@ MONA@@ PS as so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
during the lact@@ ation period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine could harm the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , flav@@ ity , dism@@ iss of hearing , mis@@ orientation , re@@ membran@@ ce and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed .
if you determine one of these symptoms , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or with the need of your hospital to establish a corresponding treatment .
if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short red@@ tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to avoid a closure ) and they received additionally other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as bu@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attack or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year a total of just as effective as the traditional treatment .
in patients who subjected itself to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators just as effective as Hep@@ arin , excluding serious ble@@ eding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ ox must not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any other ingredients .
it must not be applied to patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as with high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee on Human phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ et@@ ched replacement for Hep@@ arin is .
September 2004 , the European Commission holding the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the Transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the whole European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ ancy ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency measures or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ us@@ al of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and inf@@ usion can be increased for the duration of the surgery on 1,75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI , according to clinical requirements , the reduced influ@@ enza dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt @-@ overs of 0.5 mg / kg will be administ@@ ered by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y .
the recommended Dos@@ age of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous bol@@ um@@ ing of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of themselves directly subsequent intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the security and effectiveness of a all@@ form@@ ly Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to € 225 , a second bolt task should be made of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values , the re@@ const@@ ituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and dil@@ uted rapidly in prior application and the bol@@ us@@ ement can be administ@@ ered quickly intra@@ ven@@ ous .
once the ACT value more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided , the 1.75 mg / kg Inf@@ usi@@ ons@@ d@@ osis is correct properly administ@@ ered .
in patients with moderate kidney control , GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( ob with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value under 225 seconds is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis again .
in patients with moderate kidney cancer , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ P@@ LACE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , was the ACT value 5 minutes by gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment with an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney patients ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contrac@@ ted ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intra@@ ven@@ ous rep@@ ain@@ ted h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of Dutch h@@ ep@@ arin .
• well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity against the active ingredient or any other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood risk . • severe un@@ control@@ l@@ able hyper@@ tension and more subtle bacterial infection . • severe kidney failure ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood flow , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administ@@ ered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if PCI @-@ patients can occur under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most of the ble@@ eding to arter@@ ial point , with patients who under@@ go a per@@ v@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary coron@@ ary ( PCI ) during the treatment of principle everywhere ble@@ eding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that need treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted ( under the skin ) into the ab@@ dom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or as permanent inf@@ usion with ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin for the settlement of Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or may not process ins@@ ulin in the blood .
ins@@ ulin types diff@@ ers very little of Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change signi@@ fies that it seems faster and a shorter active duration is considered a short effective human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body is not able to produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
with type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the amend@@ ment of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at ins@@ ulin phr@@ ases .
in adults with type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes , lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration for six months after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in human Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients , which may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or any other components , or with patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when it is administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood @-@ glu@@ ing bri@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Avent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for appro@@ vals from A@@ pi@@ dra across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the ab@@ dom@@ ic@@ ation , the thig@@ h or the del@@ usion of use or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the stomach .
because of the decreased Glu@@ kon@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin may be set in case of patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of the active thickness , the trademark ( her@@ e- or ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delay , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can get a change of ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 A insufficient dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ulin @-@ in diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic Ket@@ o@@ azi@@ dose ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin types should be done under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage required .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the work profile of the is@@ ins@@ ulin delivery and can therefore change during the shift of the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that may increase the ble@@ eding activity and reinforce the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine , fi@@ d@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting @-@ enzy@@ me ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , flu@@ oxet@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pen@@ tox@@ ic@@ yl@@ lin , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ os@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ yl antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ol@@ y@@ tics such as beta @-@ lo@@ osen , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of rep@@ ain@@ ting medical regulation may be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal @-@ experimental studies on re@@ production @-@ tox@@ icity shows no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ ering ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether the ins@@ ulin gene enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general ins@@ ulin is neither in breast milk , nor will it res@@ orted to oral application .

heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with awareness can be treated by an in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Gl@@ uc@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which are given by an appropri@@ ated person , or by intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
after a bal@@ u@@ tic injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine , cause serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin lowers the blood sugar intake by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral sexual cosmic intake ( in particular through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous gau@@ - be done by is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in efficiency is faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .

ins@@ ulin types has twice as rapid as norm@@ alist as norm@@ alities and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ ing effect of about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data it was apparent that in an application of is@@ lan@@ ders in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control will be achieved as with human Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is 30 minutes before the meal .
