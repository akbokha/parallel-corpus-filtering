<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg of tablets (tablets that dissolve themselves in the mouth), as a solution to income (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. entres thinking and Speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and insulator; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic illness, in which the patients are manic episodes (period abnormal upset) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe Manical episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injecting solution is applied to the fast control of staggering unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral ingestion of the medicine is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="8">With both diseases, the solution for one or the melting-coated tablets can be applied to which the logs of tablets are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines, which are as likely as abilify, should be adapted the dose of abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. the chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears as a "participant agonist" for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter, in order to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin at schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has a role to normalize Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, eliminating psychoteric or manic symptoms and reoccur to reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of abilify, to prevent the reoccur of symptoms, was investigated in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, which are an equitable unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, abilify over twelve weeks of 347 patients with semi-operidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo that were re-occur to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of abilify injection solution was compared in a study in 301 patients with bipolar disorder that could be addressed by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the modification of patients were examined by a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also introduced studies to investigate how the body produce the melting-coated tablets and the solution to import.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection triggering, the abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced uneasiness than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying the bipolar disorder, abilify in four of the five short-term studies are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented until 74 weeks of effective as placebo the re-occur medical episodes used in previously treated patients and if in addition to an existing treatment was administered.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg dosed also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms stolen and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of abilify to take (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (obscurity), purity, nausea (nausea), purity, nausea (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleeplessness) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abilify during the treatment of schizophrenia and in preventing a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly some manic episodes and in which the manic episodes involved in the treatment with Aripiprazol, facing the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee reached the outcome that the benefits of injecting unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder when a orale therapy is not suitable to overlay the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients showing the predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazol. (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A more inclined effectiveness in doses on a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients achieved over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group should be considered a lower initialosis, if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-Indutor is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suizidalem behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and in some cases reported after the start or change of a antipsychotic therapy, even with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder does not have an increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic medication.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease (myocaricular disorders, stipulmonary diseases, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including akzelerated and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials which one year or less digest, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripiprazol in dyskinism.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in a with abilify patients are signs and symptoms of a spigonic anesthesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medication, including abilify, will be set.</seg>
<seg id="41">That is why Aripiprazol should be used in patients with cramps in the anamnese or with states that are used with cramps in cases, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol associated with patients with psychoses which were associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a increased sterisrisk compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted feebrovascults events associated with Aripiprazol responsible patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazidose or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related ununwanted events involving abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents, to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipher, Polyurie, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose values.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally considered in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolbidities, the application of antipsychotic medicines, which is gaining weight as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol based on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or any other central effective pharmaceuticals as encoding as encoding (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-protagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid-blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, although this effect is not considered to be clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy subjects, an highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) die AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisation can be the common use of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma-centred reflections compared to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolisation.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify, the potential benefits should prevail over the patient's potential risks.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protein inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">According to disruption of the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage should be raised by abilify on the Dosage before the start of the dental therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Esctract D6 can be administered with abilify, can be calculated with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day no significant effect on the metabolic mechanism of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymoran-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should get advised to notify their physician when they are pregnant or may plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "due to the insufficient data base on humans and because of the concerns, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are legally determined the potential risk for the fetus." ""</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including strength vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than below placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of downside effects is defined following the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study on patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystony and dyskinesia, compared to patients who were treated with semi-operidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS rose 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under semi-operidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In a different study conducted over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-time period, more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patients groups under Aripiprazol and placebo on those potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, revealed by no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (Creatine phosphate phosphate), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of the patients with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of the patients treated with placebo</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the adverse reactions, which can occur in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, and about their appearance also reported during the treatment with Aripiprazol, include the malignant neuroleptal syndrome and increased sterility at older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintended or intentional renditions with Aripiprazol alone with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">While there is no information on the effectiveness of a heralese with Aripiprazol before the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol before; it is unlikely that the catalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefits is, since Aripiprazol has high plasma-rotation.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol during schizophrenia and bipolar-I disruption via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors will be taught.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed in vitro a high affinity to the Dopamine D2- and D3 receptors for the Dopamine D4-, for the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 norepine and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers showed the titous reduction of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor Liginez, at the nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled spa studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophran patients with positive or negative symptoms show Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically enhanced bettering of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial was a week 52 of the proportion of Responsibility patients who held a response to study media, in both groups similar (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from Messpedals, which were defined as secondary study programmes, including a PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depressants rates, showed a significant greater improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significant reduction in backward rate that was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% less than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study was involved with schizophrenia (N = 18 or 13% of the expiry patient data sets) in significant less patients a weight gain from at least 7% compared to the output (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing of 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in reducing Manischer symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol against placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy treatments for 12 weeks in patients with a manpolar or blended episode of a bipolar disorder, showed Aripiprazol a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and an entertaining effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or semi-operidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also pointed 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie on like lithium or semi-operidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study conducted over 6 weeks with patients with a manpolar or blended episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological therapy, revealed a superior effect with Aripiprazol a superior effectiveness in reducing symptoms in comparison to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase over 74 weeks with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before Randomization a remission prior to placebo considering the prevention of a bipolar return, predominantly in preventing a return to the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyfication of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyregulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbwertszeit lies with approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazol at extender Metabolisation via CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisation via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in the Pharmaceutical inetic between male and female healthy subjects, equally demonstrated with pharmacogenic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A-specific evaluation of the Pharmaceutical inetic surrendered no indication on clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effects of smoking on the Pharmookinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacogenetic properties of Aripiprazol and Streto-Aripiprazol were similar to patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose of the study at Probanden (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Streto-Aripiprazol, but the study embraced only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, genotoxicity and canvous potential let the preclinical data have no special risks to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only by dosages or expositions that have exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to people, so they have limited to the clinical use only limited or no meaning.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects surround a dosisdependent adrenergic pigment detection and / or parenchycell damage (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis in man) and an increase of adrenal membrane keeper cination with female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the middle Steady-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis for people).</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli-active ingredient which promotes the breakdown of the microtubules from the Tubular indimishes and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibition of their deportation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilisation leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital design phase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albuminto the Transzytosis took place in the endothelm cells and in the frame of in-vitro studies was proven that the presence of Albumin the transport of Paclitaxel has been promoted by the endothelper cells.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed of a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and also contains the same substance (also "reference framework").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood levels, in which in connection with a blood transfusion complications might occur if prior to the procedure a self-blood circulation is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, which is shown for the drug.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-blood spessness, Abseamed is inenamed into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injecting can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received reasonable guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or patients who have received chemotherapy, hemostasis must always lie in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per decilites in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron-values of all patients are to control the treatment to ensure that no iron gel consists, and iron supplementary should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who have received chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems can be an aemia caused by a erythropoietingel or so that the body does not sufficiently respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used in operations to increase the number of the red blood cells, and thus reduce the consequences of a bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell to which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which they considered the formation of epetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with administration as an injection in a vein as part of a main study with 479 patients who caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems, with the reference framework.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been mapped by at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they were either introduced to Abseamed or continue to be Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the haemplate between the beginning of the study and the judgement period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study, in which the effects caused by Eprex / Titypo were examined by Eprex / Erypo with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the haematic values of patients who were directed to Abseamed were maintained in the same measure as with those patients who continue to be Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to that, patients continue to receive Eprex / Erypo, a increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output from 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptom of one encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, migratory headaches and turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be applied in patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injecting under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, since further studies are required to make sure that this triggered by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile like Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="390">If the herapcle binary around more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month infect or if the permanent herapcle binary 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) goes beyond, the epetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be supervised, in order to ensure that epetin alfa is mandatory in the lowest approved dosage, which is required for the control of anemia and the actuation symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low HB-value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher yields as patients with which the initial anaemia is less difficult (HB &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as not insulin-dependent diabetes). • It may be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (an diabetesmedikament) is not shown together with another diabetesmedikament (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may also be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted by metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulpylharnant or insulin, the previous dose of the sulpylharnant and insulin may be maintained at the beginning of Actos treatment, except in patients with Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulphylharnant and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body is better utilized, and the blood sugar levels can be improved, thus making type-2-diabetes can be better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tripley has been studied; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulpyllabnant, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosyliated hematglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar intake of the application of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripley study, the effect of the additional gift from accounts to existing treatment with metformin and a sulpylharningredient in lowering the HbA1c values by 0,94%, while the extra gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0,35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, examined the combination of actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients, the Actos in addition to insulin, compared with 0,14% for 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain increase and hypoanaesthesia (diminishing sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be used in patients, which might be possibly hypersensitive (allergic to Pioglitazone or one of the other components, still in patients with liver issues, congestive heart failure or diabetic Ketoaziah (high ketonlevels - Infidar) - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in context of a monotherapy is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment of metformin patients with which Metformin is not shown.</seg>

<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity in patients, the Pioglitazone as orale-professional or triple-combination therapy with a sulphylharnant or as a two-professional combination therapy with insulin, the risk of an dosisdependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">According to the market launch, the treatment with Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an appearance or deterioration of a diabetic Makulaödems, with a reduction in visual sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaödems, but comparative doctors should be aware of the possibility of a Makulaödems when patients talk about disruptions of visual clarity; a suitable ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>

<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants pregnancy or it occurs, the treatment is resorting (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the Pharmacology or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, alfarin, phenprocoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contrasts, cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMUGCoA reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) results in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Induktor) resulting in lowering the AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable that under the treatment of Pioglitazon, that is diminished by Pioglitazon and increased insulin resistance and thereby reduce the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal system growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the tower and the breakup of the lens elements, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic substance.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT-Anstift played over the triple of the upper border of the standardization also frequently compared to placebo, but rarer than in comparative groups under metformin or sulpyllabnant.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced makrovasculosis disease, the incidence of heavy hernia sufficiency is by 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazon or w.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has been reported rarely about cancer insufficiency in Pioglitazone, however, more frequently when Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It became a summary analysis of messages unwanted events with randomised, controlled, double-flashing studies of a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the group's uniform groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years ongoing proactive study, Frakturen at 44 / 870 (5.1%) who has been treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported top dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days stood no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific receptors (Peroxide Proliferator Activated Recepor-g (PPAR-g)), which results in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucoseproduktion in the liver and boosts the peripheral fortune in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time until the descending of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy has a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients treated under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebar-controlled study on 12 months, patients whose bloodsugar have been adjusted despite three-month optimization phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo randomized.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the medium HbA1c - value by 0,45%, compared to the patients, which continue to be insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group has been observed with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies about a year showed up under Pioglitazon, an statistically significant reduction in the Albumin / creatinin-Quotienten compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was evaluated in a small, on 18 weeks prior to examination in type-2-diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma-triglyceride level and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as low-level, but clinically increased LDL cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies for a period of up to two years of reduced Pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or limbclazide the total plasmatic-glyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was detected under Pioglitazon, not statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and extremist values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study about 20 weeks reduced Pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride level, it also improved also the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on the Triglyzerid absorption and also to the hepatic triglyzerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-advanced makrovascular disorder in groups were randomized over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiac therapy received either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly resorated, whereby the peak of leading pioglitazon can be achieved in plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV contributes to the effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficiency of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interactional studies, Pioglitazone could not have been proven that Pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the Pharmacology of Pharmacoxin, Warfarin, PhenProcoumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Induktor) increases or lowers the plasma-centration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactive pianglitazon, the marker was mainly found in the flaw (55%) and a lower scale in the Harn (45%).</seg>

<seg id="1176">In comparison, this was about 22% (60 of 268) patients under Allopurinol and in no of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhea, nausea, rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with cardioptics in the prehistory, potentially also a higher risk of certain side-effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) joined the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuriemia in diseases that have already led to priatablation (including one out of the health-history known or present present chichdelling and / or a gichtarthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the Serumharp Sealing occurs after 2-4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) can be considered a dosage increase to ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>

<seg id="1292">The doctor is therefore attentive to all signs and symptoms that are advised on possible malopophageal irritation like dyspheres, pain at lowering or retrofit, pain or new or even worsening of sodburn the medicine to fetch and medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malophageable side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not taking the medicine properly and / or it depends on symptoms associated to a malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is important that all doses can be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large, clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, were rare (after market launch) Mags- and Duodenalulzera, including some severe, and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronat Food and Drink (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antazida and some orale medicines can affect the absorption of alendronat when they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients need to wait after taking Alendronat at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interactional studies were not carried out, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials along with a multitude of usually prescribed medicines, without being clinically relevant interdependencies.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore neither applicable during pregnancy nor tactical women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronat can be no indication of directly compensatory effects in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or post-natal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonekrose of the Kiefers was reported in patients under Bisphosphonaten; most of the reports come from cancer victims, but was also reported on osteoporosis.</seg>

<seg id="1641">Usually, however, are the breast, the brain, the bones, or the whitespaces (tissues, the other structures in the body connecting, surrounds and rests) of it.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that genetically modified that it can wear a gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that there can be no copies of itself, and thus can not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been sent directly into the tumors and thus to allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, formed by the defective in the human body, is usually formed to restore damaged DNA and to aboutkill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-Gen is defective, the p53 protein has not been properly, and the cancerous cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study involving a patient at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the underground, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP received the answers of the company on the questions asked questions, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on testing the initial submitted documents created the CHMP on Day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumors will bring advantages to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the way of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficient to be established in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company not acknowledged the CHMP, whether or not the reverse consequences for patients who currently participate in clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed agents" means that the tablets are so merged that one of the effective components immediately and the other slowly is released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal rhinitis (hay drops, caused by a allergy to pollen protrudes inflammation of the nose-ways) in patients with nasal sskin-swelling (hidden noses).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and young people aged 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ends as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the Nasenschleimhaut (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced by the stipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective structure were the changes in the severity of hypocrisy symptoms that were reported by patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the trial the patients associate their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scala, as difficult to symptoms over the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In considering all hay symptom symptoms, except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the aerinaze received, about a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35,9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the Nasenschleimhaut, patients showed a alleviation of symptoms around 37,4% compared to 26,7% in the patient who captured desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykardie (cardiopacity), pharyngitis (appeal, fatigue), headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may be used in patients, which might possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against norepens agents or loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not being applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bottangle glaucoma (increased blood pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases (hypertension of the thyroid) or already have a hemorrhage (caused by brain disorder) or have a risk for a hemorrhage stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission shared an approval for the marketing of Aerobbin throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but to swallow in the whole (i.e. without cracking it or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should be applied in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on infancy and effectiveness (see section 5.1) in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after oral symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the time of application to 10 days, since in long-term use the activity of pseudoephedrine can take in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After declining the swelling of the veiled in the upper airways, the treatment can be continued when needed with desloratadine than monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimtic activity in combination of pseudoephedrine, pergolid, Lisurid, cabbage, Dihydroergotamin or other Dekongestiva, Phenolic, Dihydroergotamin, PhenylePhrine, ephedrine, Oxymetacolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The security and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient, and the data does not suffice to send corresponding recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver functioning, and the data does not suffice to send corresponding recommendations to dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be notified that the treatment in the appearance of hypertension or a tachykarthe or of Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any waids other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of the headache) must be set.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups to be advised: • patients suffering from digital arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients with a Myocardinfmarket in Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder removal or bronchitis in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours prior to implementing the matological testing, as anti-histamine can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for Hauts actions or to reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with desloratadine where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered however, were not observed a clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma-centration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotorical tests could not be found significant differences between the patients with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for Metabolism of Desloratadine Enzym has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin hemmed in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconceivable of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to incidence of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since the reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and because of the vasoconqueror features of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be noted, however, that in very rare cases it may come to one stuper that may lead to a impairment of traffic; or the ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS-depression (seeinment, Apnoe, diminished mental attention, cycles, coma, heart vascular collaps) and a ZNS-stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, convulsion, convulsions) with possible letins.</seg>

<seg id="1688">A ZNS-stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupillenrigid and - dilatation, hood, hyperthermic and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of propagorical cycles such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the Adhesive-oleküls P-Selectin on Endothelds.</seg>
<seg id="1690">For a single dose of dose with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks that are connected to the finger.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials was determined at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased incidence of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimtic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykaror or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients Aerobze tablets received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine effect of the aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall cores for symptoms (except Nasenschleimal swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of the aerinaze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect, determined by the Nasenschleimal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of the aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single-dose study on the Pharmacology of the aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroralen application of aerinaze at healthy subjects over 14 days the flow-up weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine on day 10 was reached.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharynthetic multidisciplinary study, which was conducted with the formulation as tablet to healthy adult men, was detected that four subjects of Desloratadine is badly miserable.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. dem Committee on Human pharynist (CHMP) officially declaring that the company takes its application for approval for the prevention of Aflunov to prevention of aviary H5N1 Influenza by adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied in adults and elderly people to protect against flu, which is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of Influenza-A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu breaks off if a new trunk of influx virus emerging, which can easily spread from man to person because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "after administration of the vaccine the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus as" physical "" "" body-virus "" "" and forms antibodies against it. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Thus the immune system will later be able to make a contact with a grip-virus that stem faster antibody.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus is used with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body-alien), and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study had not been conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not out to comply with the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the CHMP opinion, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years involving human immune virus-virus from type 1 (HIV-1), which is causing acquired the acquired immune syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can not swallow the capsules, Agenerase faces as a solution to income, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the security of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be ordered when the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines has been taken before, and the likelihood is that the virus is to be listened to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice a day 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is directed after the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase is reduced in combination with other antiviral medicines that HIV-quantity in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS do not cure, however, may not delay the damage of the immune system, and thus also the development of associated infections and disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, which previously had not been treated with the release.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low dosified konavir increased medicine Agenerase was compared to 206 adults, which had previously been protrued to the former protrums.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Primary indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-breaking concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In trials of patients who had previously had no prototype were reported after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than in placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase was also the viral load, however treated by the children who were previously treated with the release of the treatment previously.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, which were treated earlier with the release which had been treated with Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase the Viruslast after 16-weekly treatment as effective as other proteins</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was drug-resistant against four other proteins, it came under Agenerase, along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral last after four weeks as with the patients who reported their previous proclamation previously:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flarrhea, nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be applied in patients, which may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against facehavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should also not be applied in patients, the currant (herbal supplements for treating depression) or medicines that are as well as Agenerase and are considered to be harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV, Agenerase are taking the risk of a dual-podystrophy (changes in the distribution of body tissues), a osteonecrose (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immunomactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection which are caused by the recovering immune defence).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human Development (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Agenerase used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacovinic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously been unable to have a prototype.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons limited information." ""</seg>

<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, proteins and children aged 4 and older.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Agenerase capsules to be administered for pharmacovintic boostination of amponavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance clsters and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ameliavr as a solution for income is 14% lower than capsule; therefore Agenerase capsules and solution for income are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of payavir twice daily along with 100 mg konavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase is applied without the intensifying additive of Ritonavir (Boosterung), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of payavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of payavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharyninetics, effectiveness and safety of angenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data on infancy and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharynthetic data, the dose should be reduced to Agenerase capsules in adult patients with medium-tougher liver functioning on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver functioning on 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be done in patients with mild or moderate life-functioning with caution, in patients with severe liver functioning, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase cannot be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals, which have a small therapeutic width and also present substrates of the Cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing currants (hypericum perforatum) may contain, may not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plasmakonzentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Ameliavir while taking Ameliavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current anti-retroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, Agenerase capsules, along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with a anti-retroviral combination therapy, have increased risk of severe liver juices with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including a chronically-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver functioning under a antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticism or other glucocoroids, which weighs over CYP3A4, is not recommended, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment is overdue to systemic cortical-effects including morbus Cusdepended and suppression of the adrenal function. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reduction of Hemmer Lovastatin and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, is not recommended a simultaneous administration of vasculase, lovastatin and simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and Warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards-Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentric.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective for a decreased plasma-aspar of ameliavr (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Ameliavir can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given simultaneously with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of symptoms, especially if there is also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of a toxicity, due to the high propylene glyceration of the Agenerase solution for income, this is contracted by children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution at certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash may be accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the veil-skins are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an anti-retroviral therapy including prototyping, was reported via the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exception of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, their therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. Higher age, and with medication-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders, associated with drug interpretations.</seg>
<seg id="1956">With hashophile patients (type A and B) which were treated with the release of which were reported are reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous comcastanians and hemorthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV infected patients with heavy immune defect can develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factual aetiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy body-measure index), cases of osteonekrose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-substrates with low therapeutic width is not given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals, which have minimal therapeutic width and also substrate of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given together with pharmaceuticals whose active ingredients are primarily changed over CYP2D6 and are associated for the increased plasma bricks with severe and / or life-threatening adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in AUC by Amprenavir, which can cause a virologic failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">At the attempt, which humiliated plasma-asped by a dosage increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very frequently observed unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johannishable (Hypericum perforatum) The Serumspiegel of amprenavir can be degradable by the simultaneous application of herbal plugs (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already refers to currant, the payload, and, if possible, the viral load is to review and set the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not required if Nelfinavir administered along with payavir (see also vanfavio lower).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased for Cmax on the other hand by 30% lower when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with payavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of payavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and uncertainty of this treatment schemata.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when payload (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin value of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg / opinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ameliavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg konavir twice daily is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A metering recommendations for the simultaneous appointments by Ameliavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to a narrative surveillance as the effectiveness and inconceivable of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacogenetic study conducted using Agenerase in combination with didanosin, but due to antacid components of Didanosin is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the gift of Efavio, in combination with ameliavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavio in combination with amyavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposition of both proteins might be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other proteins and available data can be presumed that nevirons may suspect the serum Concentration of ameliavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin because of the decreased / or possibly subtherapeutic plasma may be less effective.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are applied collectively, caution is offered; a thorough clinical and virology monitoring is to be made since an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of payavir and Ritonavir is difficult for delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amprenate and rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmakonzentration (AUC) of Rifabutin around 193% and thus to a rise in associated side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons, refabutin along with Agenerase is advised to reduce the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical chemokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, could be the plasma-brick of both drugs in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir. a day led to an increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole in plasma around 25% and the AUC (0-balance) compared to the value, which was observed after 200 mg / ketoconazole once daily without a simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with Agenerase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs when they are applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it may come to resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva, which are known as enzymeriductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, Carbamazepine), with Ameliavir can lead to a humiliation of the plum shaft of ameliavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, diluted pin, cardio pin, carotpin, Nisoldipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased 10 by payavr, causing possibly boosting the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase considerably and increase with PDE5 inhibitors to linked side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days passed over, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% discount intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase is not recommended along with these glucocoroids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cortical-effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA reduction of inhibitatin such as lovastatin and cinvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases of plasma-aspire while in-time administration.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspiegelung this HMG-CoA reduction of inhibitors to myopathy, including a cohabdomyolyse, the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">There will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization the mirror, since the plasma-centredness of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at equivalent to ameliavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase should not be applied along with orally perceived Midazolam (see section 4.3), while in the same application of Agenerase with parrally Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protein inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma-waves of Midazolam around 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon administered along with Ameliavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opatentment symptoms of symptoms, especially if there is also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se of small reproduction of historical merit, there is currently no recommendation to be given, such as the preneurship's dose is to be administered by methadon at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In a simultaneous engagement of warfarin or other oroagulants along with Agenerase, an increased control of the INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of downing or strengthening of anti-oxidant effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive practices, therefore, are recommended as alternative methods of contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in a temporal gift of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used after pregnancy after careful diligation of potential usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk fractive rats has been proven amprenavir-related substances, however, it is not known whether ameliavir is over into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of bearer rats, which was administered by the unication in the uterus until the end of the lactation period was administered, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the income, including fertility and reproduction, was not affected by the administration of ameliavr to the mother's mother.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The infinity of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderate, occurred early and often led to treatment breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events is not clarified whether in connection with the intake of Agenerase or any other at the same time to HIV infection treatment, or whether they are a result of undersex diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with which accounts for the patients 1200 mg of Agenerase received twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), presented by the investigators as in connection with the study medicine, and more than 1% of patients occurred, as well as in the treatment (degrees 3 to 4) are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy has been associated with a redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV infection, including a loss of peripheral and fast-skin fatty tissues, hypertrophia of the breasts and dorsozervikal floss (pin).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Below 113-retroviral not available to patients who were treated with Amisudin / Zidovudin in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin on a medium length of 36 weeks, was only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- previously treated patients under amprenate 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with different NRTIs over a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Thousands of thousands were usually easy to moderate-shaped or makulopapulose nature, with or without itch and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with ameliavr had to be cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekrose were particularly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">For HIV infected patients with heavy immune defect can be developed at the time of introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dosified Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), were kind and frequency of effects (degrees 2 to 4) and CPK values, which received in patients, the Agenerase along with low dosified Ritonavir, very frequently occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose the patient is at sign of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if required, are necessary support measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ameliavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the procession viral gag- and gag-pol- Polyproteinlevels with the result of a formation unmature, non infectious Viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in akut and chronically infected blastema (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory (IC50) of ameliavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute cells and amounts of only µs in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The link between the activity of Ameliavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral patients with currently approved fossil fuels / Ritonavir-dosages were reported - as with other Ritonavir genoosterten treatment schemas with protein inhibitors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">With sixteen of 434-retroviral not available to patients who received the 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, joined a virological losure up week 48, whereby 14 insulates could be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolate of 13 of 14 children, with which a virology failure in the 59 entered, with which accounts not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns, which were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and her extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107), with which accounts receivable over 96 weeks, the following prototype mutations on:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing based on Genotypic interpretations systems can be applied to estimate the activity of ameliavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defined resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I, I54A / C / V, I54A / C / V, I54A / C / V, I54A / C / V, I98V and L90M in conjunction with a fueled phonic range with Ritonavir as well as a decreased probability of virologic response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data and it is advised to attract the current interpretations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In the monotypic resistance-based analyses, clinically validated interpretations systems may be applied in conjunction with the genotypic data on the assessment of the activity of Ameliavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to expel the diagnostic tests, have clinically-phenomenal cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to ameliavir associate pattern creates a certain cruel resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir but generally remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between Ameliavir and other proteins for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral-treated scheme (one of which showed a fossil-resistance against atazanavir / Ritonavir.

<seg id="2038">The receipt of the efficacy of uncontaminated Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving a total of 288 HIV infected children between the ages of 2 and 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase is used to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosisted Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients with PI-treated patients had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) who administered NRTIs together with Agenerase.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapists, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapists, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be enhanced by the extra gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient in a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemical otherapists received, which are powerful and excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are shown 59% of patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of the patients treated with Ondansetron (126 by 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are reported 81% of the patients who were treated with Aloxi in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">When compared with Dolasetron, these values were at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted the European Commission in Helsinki Erex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Aloxi in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indices: for the prevention of acoustic nausea and vomiting at strongly emetogenic chemotherapy given to cancer of cancer and vomiting with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy given to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and omiting that is induced by a strongly emboating chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding any prior chemotherapy given Corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colyantage, patients should be monitored with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subtle Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 protagonists, however, caution is not able to extend the chronology of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or with patients in which the Qt- intervall is extended or the need for such prolongation.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with other chemical otherapeutics division, Aloxi in the days after chemotherapy was neither intended to prevention, nor to treat nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies hemmated Palonosetron failed to inhibit the activity of five caretted Chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study no significant pharmacogenetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-static concentration oroclopramids, of a CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one on a population-based pharmacovinetic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Inhibitors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin, Fluoxetine, necidin, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertrthalene and Terbinafin) have no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies can not be used, so Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is necessary by the treating doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies the most common in a dose of 250 mcg to observed side effects (total of 633 patients), which at least possibly with Aloxi associated with Aloxi related to headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of abundance programs (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar cases of undesirable events like in the other dosing groups; there were no dose of outcomes to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis however probably does not provide effective therapy in a suicide-assessment.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-placement studies were a total of 1.132 patients, which received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg or 750 mg Dolasetron (half-time period 7 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-day 7.3 hours), which was given on Day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study were a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetved chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to the 32 mg of Ondansetron which were given to date 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate-resistant chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for the indication-induced spill and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters, including the QTc-Intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondanuous and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of preclinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block both the ventricular DE- and reolarization involved Ionenkins and extend the duration of the shareholder.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out to 221 healthy subjects of the study was the assessment of EKG-effects of I.V. administered Palonosetron in single dosen of 0,25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resortion After intravenous gift follows an initiale lorescence of plasma-centrations a slow elimination from the body with an average-dimensional semi-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma-centric variation (Cmax) and the surface area under the concentration on-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire Dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans, the average daily (± SD) increase in Palonosetron-plasma-concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Derived from pharmacovokinetic simulations, that once again reached a full intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron by 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), with which a non-recurring intravenous administration of 0,75 mg was higher. however, the Cmax after the acquisition of 0,75 mg was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated via the kidneys, and some more 50% are converted into two primary metabolic processes, compared to Palonosetron less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolic devices have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a minor extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 at the Metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosetron as an immutable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolts at healthy, the total-clearance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver functioning the terminale Eliminationshalbwertzeit and the average systemic exposition with Palonosetron increases, a reduction of the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">Clinical trials have been observed only after extruders who are considered adequate for the maximum humanistic exposure, which indicates a little relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies have clues that Palonosetron is able to block only in very high concentrations of Ionenkamchannels that are involved in the ventricular DE- and repolarization and prolonging the stockings duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose was given in about the 30times of the therapeutic deception in man) who were given daily over two years, led to a multiply incidence of liver tumor, pancreas, pannierenmark) and skin-gates at Ratten, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high doses of metering and since Aloxi is determined by humans for the unique application, the relevance of these results is low as low as humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) adopted a negative expertise in which the authorisation of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended in the treatment of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that the aleon of a biological medicine called Roferon-A should resemble the same pharma an effective component that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference framework)."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (longstanding) hepatitis C (one by bacteral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue points out, and the values of the liver enzymatic Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been produced, which stimulated this to the formation of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon provided data provided by the comparison between Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, impact, safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study involved in patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon with the effectiveness of the reference is compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Measured in the study, how many patients said after 12 of total 48 therapy weeks as well as 6 months after adjustment of the treatment to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were raised that the data for the stability of the drug and the drug can not suffice by means of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which said to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flames the disease in more patients than in terms of reference, Alphons had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test was shown in the study to examine the question, inwieweit the medication constitutes an immune response (d. h. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) unsolved, not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used to treat bepetigo (one with crust formation of incoming skin infection) and small initinfected Lazerations (Riss- or cutting-wounds), deed and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for treating infections, which is detectable or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against these kinds of infections could not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2% of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient speaks to the patient after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blockade the bacterial ribosom (the parts of the bacterium in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Primary indicator of the effectiveness happened in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was diskled after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.7%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hausunden, Altargo and Cefalexin similar response: if the results of both studies were taken together in Hausunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups relate to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies however, was found that Altargo has been caused in the treatment of waste (the crowded cavities in the body tissues) or infections, which have been provoked or presumably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation by the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human pharma (CHMP) suggests that the benefits of altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections against the risks are outwined: • Impetigo, • infected small incisions, dediced or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission holding the company Glaxo Group Ltd. set out a permit for travel by Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients in which no improvement within two or three days should be examined, should once again be examined and an alternative therapy is considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of a sensitisation or serious local irritation by using retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is canceled, the anointment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used for treating infections in which MRSA is known as terrestrial or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary schools, the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin resistent staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were uninsufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small Plasmakonzentrations, which were obtained upon people after topical application on the diced skin or infected with superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant imitation in vivo not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After equal amounts of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle frapamulin sC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on deed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not necessary for required if topical saviulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive-toxicity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in regards to a statement about the birth and the Federal al / post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Sbe should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicative and the application of retapamulin is preferable to present a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding has continued / ended or the therapy with altargo continues to be ended, between the benefits of breastfeeding for baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, was the most frequently reported side-effect irritation at the abreichungsort, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">It is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (former Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The drug mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective imitation of bacterial protections by interacting on a particular bond of the 50 subunit of the bacteriellen Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interbacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Binderstelle ribosomales Protein L3 involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P bond, and the PeptidylhassaseCentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Through liaison at this bond-point hemp Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, block partially P binary interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50-bosomal subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should appear on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin at least some infection forms, should be striving through expert advice.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolation were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of no show-speaking on the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption in a study with healthy adults was charged 1% retapamulin Salbe daily on Occlusion on intact and on the skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days in the topical treatment of secondary education, individual Plasmaprobs were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 with adult patients each prior to medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system inclusion involving human beings on a topical application of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 with meager skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP converter.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The Metabolism of Returamulin in human Lebanmikrosoma was primarily supported by CYP3A4, in the lower participation of CYP2X and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral Toxicity at Ratten (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>

<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the transport has to make sure that a drug vigilance is present, as in the module 1.8.1 of authorisation application (Version 6.2) is present and functions before the product will be marketed and as long as the product is being marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the approval for the Transport is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical chemist activities, as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management System for the products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms show at the operator's job, you should end the application of altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not turn other salts, creams or lotions on the surface that will be treated with altargo if it does not submit you explicitly from your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that concern the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used within the framework of a two doses of existing vaccines, whereby any protection against Hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix is allowed only to be used if the immunization is a low risk of HCV infection and is ensured that the two doses can end up existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against Hepatitis A or B, Ambirix, or another hepatitis A or B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines also function by bringing the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "as it can turn against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccination of Twinrix adults and the associated vaccine Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines have to be used to protect the same disease, Twinrix adults and Twinrix which will be administered out of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and TwinX adults included identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix Adults, also used as a testet for applying Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness has been the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a sixteen-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against Hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix which was similar to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, Applicitmangel, pain at the injections, redness, matity (fatigue) as well as friction.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may respond in patients, which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission divided the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix throughout the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardized plan for prized and Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, may be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalous vaccines or with a combination of combinant vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HCV anti-hepatitis Consultants (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV) antifungal values are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed up to whether immuno-expert persons, who have addressed a refreshed vaccine as protection, as they may also be protected at no longer detectable antibodies, possibly by the immune memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injectors, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against Hepatitis B is required, the standardization ema is recommended with the Compression wrinkles, the 360 ELISA units formalinine hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With haystalysis and persons with disorders of the immune system, after primacy, under certain circumstances, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because a intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the buttocks could lead to an suboptimal imbalance, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In Thrombozytopenie or blood-irritation, Ambirix can be injected however, as in these cases, intramuscular gift may come to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix starts in the second year in the form of a separate injection, tetellularem Pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined mascot mumps-Roman vaccine was administered was the immune response to all antigens sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In case of patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immunity, it must be assumed that may not be sufficient immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial that has conducted with 3 vaccines, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the earlier Thiomersal- and preservative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered by a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 up to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix compared with the 3-cans of non-recursive disorder.</seg>

<seg id="2754">Pain has been observed according to the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the Probanden, compared to 39.1% in the sampling after the gift of a dose of the 3-doses of non-recursive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccecycle reported 66.4% of the subjects, which had Ambirix administered down over pain, compared to 63.8% at the test subjects who have been vaccinated with the 3-dos- combination-gland.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of matactivity was comparable to pro Proband (i.e. across the entire vaccine at 39.6% of the Probanden, the Ambirix received, compared to 36.2% in the subjects that received the 3-cans of non-recurring treatments).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of precipant pain and matrity was low and comparable that was observed after administration of the combination of the drop-in vaccine with the 3-Cans vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccine, the appearance of local actions and general actions in the Ambience was comparable to that in administration with the 3-Cans-combined hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen observed.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been announced since issuance of the first approval for the application, the CHMP opinion is that the benefit risk-ratio for Ambirix is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix is only placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited because of low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplettous enzyme or with hyperammonal encephalopathy (brain damage as a result of high ammoniacentricular) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - split into several subtrousers to meals - swallowed under the food mixed or via an gastrostcloth (through the abdomication in the stomach of leading hose) or a nose-onde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonaps not could be compared to any other treatment or placebo (a hypocrament, i.e. without a substance).</seg>

<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "exceptional circumstances" as due to the rarity of the disease at the time of authorisation only limited information to this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicative in all patients in which a complete encipline has already manifested in the rebirth age (within the first 28 life-days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifesto form (incomplete end result, which manifests itself after the first life of life) then there is a indication of use when anamnese is a hyperoptic cephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with gorges is AMMONAPS also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by means of protein obarbitration and the development and development necessary for the patient's development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early lack of carbylphosphate synthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase is the substitution of Citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosuccinatsynthetic defect must be obtained in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS pills may not be administered patients with lovels- as a risk for the emergence of Ösophagusulzera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS includes 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe rename insufficiency, as well as with sodium and eatile prevention states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutate has been carried out over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of the neuronal multiplication and a stolen loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delay maturing of torebral synapses and a diminished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is eliminated in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS entered at 56% of patients at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events have assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>

<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis was posed early and the treatment immediately started to improve the chance of survival and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early-manifesting form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the renaissance age was earlier almost always infarse, and the illness themselves led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their stures-free analogy inside the first life year to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through the catalysis, the exploitation of alternative ways of nitrogen oxication (sodium and sodium phenylacetate), proteinreduced costs and sodium of essential amino acids it was possible to diagnose the survival of newborn in postpartal (however within the first living conditions) of diagnosed with 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease has been diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hypercomic enzyme, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with the time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with belated form of the disease (including feminine patients with the heterozygoten form of ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammonium cephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyta and a protruding diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat oxifies to phenylacetate, which is conscientificated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>

<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutted (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or as permanent infusion with insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the settlement of Glucosespiegels (sugar) in the blood or may not process insulin in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin types differs very little of Humaninsulin, and the change signifies that it seems faster and a shorter active duration is considered a short effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was examined in application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body is not able to produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">With type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the amendment of concentration of substance glycosyliated hematglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type-1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% at insulin phrases.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2-diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration for six months after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human Normalinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients, which may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against insulin or any other components, or with patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood-gluing bricks.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "September 2004, the European Commission shared the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approvals from Apidra across the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is considered subcutaneous injecting either in the area of the abdomication, the thigh or the delusion of use or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the decreased Glukoneogenesis-capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, the insulin may be set in case of patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active thickness, the trademark (here- or), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinc-delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can get a change of insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the breakage of a treatment, in particular in patients with a insulin-in diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and diabetic Ketoazidose; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin types should be done under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the work profile of the isinsulin delivery and can therefore change during the shift of the treatment schemas.</seg>
