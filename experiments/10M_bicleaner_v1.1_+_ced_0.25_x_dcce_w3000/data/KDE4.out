package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; you can set up settings extensions .... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list with standard software modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , that &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for extras down@@ s . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to the crash , or the list of the cr@@ ashes if present , delete .
the load@@ able filter module ( also called the folder filter ) you can reach in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras In@@ side filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different types of filters .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use extras ( M tree trees ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ ance , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this root proposition .
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text files , in order to view the content of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of ins@@ ulated Order hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so called Tree map graph@@ ically . each object is displayed by a rectang@@ le , whose area is proportional to its size . this size has to possess the property that the sum of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . according to that , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display a rectang@@ le , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation you own the right @-@ area meaningful shades and labelling .
the colour of a rectang@@ le , which is swit@@ ched via color mode , can be either a depth for the light detection of the dis@@ infection or the illustration of a different file type such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectang@@ le can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the relevant file or of the folder . for each feature , you can indicate whether enough space to be displayed at all or if the display may occur through restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the sign@@ age in the rectang@@ le .
in display algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this objective is not always respected . it will be frame to be available to the dis@@ infection of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectang@@ le square is square .
as is the distribution of an item for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate items , the implementation is provided . here it is to be sei@@ zed and into account for the areas of space so that rec@@ tan@@ gles , the best methods of this regard are rows , columns or record .
you can set the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu view view . instead , a smoke @-@ pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ ordered entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small application application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ Cach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .

modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transfer . the camera will then be implemented via the Picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may be used in terms of connection with the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which has an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . Winter@@ 2 also supports the Picture transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol based on the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it permits the transmission of images from digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . as photos are generally large files and transmission over the serial port slowly , this connection has now out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ phot@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be available at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ gu@@ x@@ if support , so that the pr@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might possibly do anything or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came , is how easy to extend his functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a shared module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the photo@@ graphic album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also use a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s essentially simple , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; even perform .

met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata are available according to your definition data , which will provide information about or a documentation of other data that may be managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t know &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; . the approach to store met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archi@@ ving to which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and you need to know anything in your system is to build up information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether to have other access to your own computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . do not mind that you have to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . accommodations can be found quickly via your location . if you want to make enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is a folder for images you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers could have different requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , work@@ flows , constant assignment of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files , and you will not be able to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the p@@ ile , easy . separate new ones of old files .
the separation of original and labour @-@ files simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend using met@@ adata in the setup page of met@@ adata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can det@@ ri@@ mental the met@@ adata from the database in the files by choosing the item from the item on the item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? it puts you to change a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now select each photo keywords , comment and an evaluation . of course you can select all the images that will need the same attri@@ bute and then bet the value . you start the best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s now take us with key@@ word , keywords , as you continue in other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import cat@@ alog@@ ous images from another source with built @-@ in key@@ word , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; automatically insert the tree for you to build the images to the right location . the changing keywords will be settled on a different one . the changed keywords are updated by &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; updated while it pursu@@ es the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata are re@@ gro@@ unded . this is a very cru@@ de representation , since each block of met@@ adata about truth consists of many sections . fil@@ ename and calendar dates of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaint or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you want to see most of your photos just as you want , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in getting your photos .
have a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . w@@ ow ! one starts to dream , associations , memories , the historical time @-@ span is again present , you may even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning to observer , to help Him via the mot@@ if you have moved to what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect when the strength has only to work with a complaint for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; you can store any number of text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , when cap@@ tion . you can even export it to your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the web design system . you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the opening @-@ release a second time .
do you remember the times prior to GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation have already begun with light speed .
the possibilities of Geol@@ ocation decre@@ asing are already countless and will open in the future as well . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can open your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data . you can also export the photos at the reception . you can also export the photos on the reception . you can export the images also to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps @-@ viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word @-@ game with copyright and refers to copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information on the one @-@ way pages of &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it was not desired by the name of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization should be saved . after that this value it should not be changed . this field does not support cler@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( syn@@ onym for use of the photographer ) : linked with the author . examples of this field contains the work drawing of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . as this is a note for the author &apos;s abstract , it must be filled out as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the offer field to identify who the photo . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photograph is listed here , you can find the picture here . if the picture is a bearing photo , the group / Agency will provide the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections . anyone who has no protection against abuse at work with computers can delete or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Half @-@ professionals , this protection against it is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; will provide such a module for p@@ ile processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that you can also occur with traditional paper pictures or negative . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called Neue Medien .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data @-@ breaking company of the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss .
to combat the problem at CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ ti@@ ous must be treated more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe this is in your mess@@ enger .
CD / DVD dis@@ ks can be read@@ able , but you can store this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording boxes , and they are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . it turns out to be the right option .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written about . 75 % of the data are just effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and controls . despite this massive protection they need by chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for broken CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster das apparently causes mir@@ acles in CDs and DVDs . it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to dis@@ rupted data from damaged disco@@ s , hard@@ disk , flas@@ hes , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual layer of Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB thus almost six@@ teen the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good entrance on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . read then the media with a description , date &amp; author and afterwards det@@ ain@@ ted on a clean , dark and protected area . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read through this media .
dis@@ car@@ makers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing operations include a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ ruption
in brief : dis@@ ks keeping in the temper@@ ament area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C are the most common error message , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of the SM@@ ART errors will notice the immediate forthcoming exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are in particular read@@ ings and publishing teeth . the expected lifetime situation is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete ver@@ ti@@ est due to over @-@ tension . of course , you can also backup data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be back without any major problems .
while most electric machines doesn &apos;t make much out , the device starts with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause heavy damage , complete data loss , hardware design , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect themselves from the inev@@ it@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of energy heat is absorbed and the rest is gro@@ unded . it &apos;s usually available in the form of a jum@@ per . don &apos;t think that any jum@@ per will also include an over@@ voltage shield .
if you are looking for an over@@ hau@@ ling protection , then you should pay attention to the UL in 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of the protection against flash envel@@ ope and thus protects the properly closed devices .
since any excess of cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention to the fact that also all the periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms , as well as by doing a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cables of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and TV .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ clo@@ ck@@ ering protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , which is therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem . this means that you are ideal for travel .
while an over@@ hau@@ er protection of your system will not really help you with a complete fall . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ cut energy supply .
in addition to the protection from surplus @-@ up , these devices can automatically be ref@@ unded . this gives you the possibility to store your data and manage the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are satisfied with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting .
you have concerns the potential risk that your b@@ ills system is exposed and and compare its safety with electricity dis@@ rup@@ tions with the costs for avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ service contains S3 - Simple Storage service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration you can use this as drive below &amp; Linux ; to use Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo @-@ community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com . their free memory is limited to photos and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional variant will not provide you more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data protection , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically termin@@ ated thanks to the TCP @-@ protocol and among the big companies it is included in the offering a backup and a di@@ visible memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and mal@@ fs put at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that you have occurred when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . it &apos;s pretty distur@@ bing that there is no protection to your computer . nobody seems to have thought of it . nobody seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer unit than the inside your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission power , since they create interference in the data currents . at normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already , 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates that can deal with records on lower level and can be highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many pat@@ ents and is available under one to the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle launched a new initiative with its b@@ tr@@ acker fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms being used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data lu@@ ke@@ es for not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . with not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses . it results in lower damage than B. theft or re @-@ install@@ ments . and it is currently not limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been assured no more .
open source fil@@ esystem are less pr@@ one to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itiner@@ aries , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the widespread file systems . a very good English article on this can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an in@@ defined status will be avoided before the problem appeared before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the root causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and smok@@ ables for all types of lighting sensors are no longer distant .
today &apos;s cameras go into the direction of 10 Meg@@ ap@@ ix@@ oc@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics . even DSLR cameras have your line with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format Sens@@ ors ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not make any other reservation responsible for data loss . so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any bit dangerous as the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on a remote SATA drive . if , then one day , a bolt suggests , you are lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot . forget air@@ planes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ er@@ ate is always a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stair@@ way up , into the neighboring building , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a backup loss in spite of safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot of your history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differenti@@ ation : a backup of the files which have been updated since the last complete backup began . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two tim@@ eline : to the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ation .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup began . you can restore the original status to any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system at the next with the exception it is only de@@ duc@@ ted and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to Script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other kinds of file transfer , r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens comp@@ ressed and if you would like to increase security via ssh .
make important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to have DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure lets you take enough time to detect losses and restore it . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least a month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further out@@ dressing should be done manually , after which you made a complete review .
themes : met@@ adata , in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding pictures and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , view@@ ings , ... , use of the internet .
that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
because the future because of your nature is un@@ predic@@ table you need to look at all of what is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance has to be taken . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the statements made in this document . use or switching to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alisation is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards .
scal@@ ability is an expert @-@ pressure for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means an increase .
let &apos;s suppose that you have planning the scal@@ ability with plans and the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not depend on it .
&amp; Dollar ( dd / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iron if needed
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
GI@@ F is a propri@@ etary , pat@@ ented format that is slowly dis@@ appears from the market . it therefore should not be used anymore .
PNG was developed as an open source standards designed to replace GI@@ F , but it can save X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ Bit per colour and Chrom@@ ati@@ ous data for improved color information , but not as many as TI@@ FF requires and a slow comm@@ em@@ oration . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF may be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed shape or in a container with a s@@ lu@@ st@@ free comp@@ ression sal@@ v@@ mus ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed according to the need for the need . it is now based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and comm@@ its to the use of met@@ adata : DN@@ G is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well .
this is perhaps one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ forms ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF . it is compatible with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer a original picture of your recording , mostly in the rough format , to archive . X@@ MP adap@@ ts , since it saves the met@@ adata se@@ perate separately from the image file , and as above mentioned it is noted , if you use DN@@ G as container and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization supporting a fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , supporting the work on a architecture and mod@@ elling , discussions and joint work in the D@@ CM@@ I Communities and the D@@ CM@@ I Group , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections , and awareness efforts to reach a broader acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera edi@@ um are you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a refined processing , you can use external programs . if you want to edit the images again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate , then you should add the met@@ adata once again . these were under circumstances cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited paintings for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ erien , ex@@ ts you in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print them &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; in the section Ad@@ ding a photo on an album you can add a description of how you have already installed on your hard disk . but the camera interface presents you with many advanced settings to import images to your b@@ ending database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val , connect them with the computer , turn the camera to the ad mode and switch it off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , this will try to connect with your camera . if the connection is established , a skill image appears at the lower end and the prec@@ arious images of all photos on the camera will display . some cameras are not provided . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for the file fil@@ ment for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information on any entry . with the page , properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an item or met@@ adata .
this dialog features file features and the photo@@ graphic information , which is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that at some digital cameras do not provide any information .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata like external , manufacturing , GPS etc. of the image . these information is the same as in the met@@ adata sheet , from the main window of &amp; dense ; or picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the button Download and then you download the photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; en@@ gi@@ arrived ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired starting with the default methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download copies . the button @-@ chosen template is loaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera is supported this is an option new download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; dense ; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the Show@@ room . if you choose this option , you will be downloaded only the new pictures .
when you choose the buttons All you want to download or download a program , appears in which the photos are retri@@ eved . details of the existing albums will be displayed like normal folder , displayed in the section My albums . select then the target album from the list and press OK .
after having selected the finish album , you press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of it at once , by using the button Clear , so you have to select them first and use the del@@ eting exit .
note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera . therefore , the photos are not deleted from the camera , so you should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ b ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete it from the camera , as this is significantly quicker .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially expres@@ sive name . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once again , in case you load photos of various recording criteria into the same album . therefore , it can be useful , the date and time when the image was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for turning and spi@@ res of the picture and for file @-@ based sub@@ folders . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options indic@@ ating the transfer opens three more options that are stored before the photos are stored on the record . the first two affect the data on the author default . if you choose this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the text @-@ information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format than the standard format , for example in the processing field the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % H : % M : % S . place this option date &amp; time to use . for further adjustments , you should be read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small @-@ case letters . or in large letters , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; dense ; for a photo used , is displayed below the name that displays the camera in th@@ umb@@ nails . your settings for ren@@ aming can be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera image .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; you can use any information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time to carry out an automatic fil@@ ing during the shut@@ ters . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side bar Met@@ adata , you can check out more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo .
the automatic fil@@ ing is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch to automatic fil@@ tering , use the button Advanced and choose the automatic fil@@ ing in the lower area of the window .
when your camera supplied information about the date on which the photo was made available , can create &amp; di@@ gi@@ b ; this nem@@ esis are based on the image data . not all cameras will be displayed in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras will provide this information . in the section side bar Met@@ a data you can check which information your camera could be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually off @-@ off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photos directly in the finish album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option and choose the option built @-@ based shelter at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos of their machine on their camera is to download . select then upload . the file choice dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files which can be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file using the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you , where the pictures will be up@@ loaded . a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera appears . pick up the desired folder and push OK to load the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general concept in this document , which is indicated in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and which can be indicated on a map . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photo graph@@ s it may be interesting to link up a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to manipul@@ ate an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents may use this capability .
if you later forgotten where exactly the photo was done , you can locate a postcard from another &amp; di@@ gi@@ b ; users who want to locate the location of the photos can thus be location , or simply wish to document the location , it is good the position @-@ data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ are assisted lots of GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card reference . therefore , there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via an processing of GPS data and image files with the IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally via the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .

downloading the GPS data from one device can be made with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you have to store this data in the g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical stat@@ ment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and long@@ itu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the bad@@ ges Co@@ ordin@@ ate coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com does not show European roads . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .

this page contains , as shown below , standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the appropriate IP@@ TC data areas , if the option is selected by downloading the camera data . even with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .

Over@@ - and sub@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or brigh@@ ter color in the image . these colors will be set here . in the picture editing , this attachment can be inserted and off @-@ off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sam@@ pling , the images in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance is coded than in the color @-@ form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation .
with setting of PNG comp@@ ression you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery does not reduce the image quality , since PNG is using a free algorith@@ m . if you have a fast computer , you can put this value on a high comp@@ ression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ressing you can switch to the Def@@ late -@@ comp@@ ression sal@@ v@@ mus for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the def@@ ect algorith@@ m is free .
with the setting of a free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can easily save yourself . even if you choose the lu@@ st@@ acked adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata was not supported , but was in the planning .
in the previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ us , the picture editing only an image for photos . currently , it quickly developed into a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image editing .
the default sam@@ pling is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option with a minimal loss of details . this option makes the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 transm@@ itter @-@ pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the whit@@ ew@@ n is used as equal to the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the whit@@ ew@@ ash is not set . standard is it a fixed colour balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting will be supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD S@@ LR cameras . the swe@@ eping of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps more details in the cutting edge . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is it the top spot , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture , as being per@@ sever@@ ing white . use the setting out un@@ folded results as they show the cro@@ chet in different Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the det@@ ox@@ es .
this is possible because blue pixels typically do not get as fast as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixel . of course this is a matter how much colour or white you want .
selecting the option re@@ constructed , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually .
Set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ wert to your taste . however , you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default one . but this can also later be made in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go con@@ serv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing - algorith@@ m is a digital image process to get a complete picture from the partial image data sensor , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix colour@@ ful pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ kon@@ struction .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m of cra@@ b . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting when you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ bab@@ ing of your lenses , you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a so@@ ot@@ able correction , since you are performed during the pipe .
a profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; information such as the color wrap from a color tree in the other are to translate the colors as closely as possible .
behaviour issues if a picture is opened in the image processing , / color @-@ storage module with raw files .
colours @-@ folder S@@ addle up here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you save all of your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; investig@@ ates this folder then during Star@@ ts .
determine Sett@@ ings of ICC profiles you have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed by opening the raw file later .
the color @-@ view view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed with the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the cam@@ er@@ ator and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or Gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently corrected d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not apply to con@@ versions at 16 bit depths . this means you need to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Proof profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually correct instead of being on the flas@@ hing algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile is provided for what is provided . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and prof@@ iling along . this answer is obviously in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the destination : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; imag@@ ery and image processing . by making this interface can assist &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; many modules were supported to work with each program , which support the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the one you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; all modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks which can be performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings sub@@ commands .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manual books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator cle@@ ared the time between the image processes , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other an@@ to@@ cks turn on the met@@ adata on the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera characteristics displayed on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side above there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , and in the image line mode . currently , here are Seri@@ elle , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire factory mass storage .
at the bottom of the end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage c@@ era . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ - , specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val , you must connect and turn the camera to your computer to turn it into the ad mode .
pro@@ bi@@ ere you know if &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will be displayed in the menu camera .
you can select any design@@ ation for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can fit all of it here .
with the option confirmation of confirmation of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ aps , you can view the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; by del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ente ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise , you need to apply the changes to the button changes .
you can also integrate the display of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome screen of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Star@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the circumstances , this speeds up the start of the start@@ up process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the setting A@@ m start looking for new photos , forcing the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start @-@ time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; . if something from the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schem@@ as can be in &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be displayed under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is recorded below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ val , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item advertisement
the picture editing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; therefore you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section image editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current date folder , aug@@ mentation factor and the current image size .
a tool@@ bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , no of the features will change the original photo before you save file stor@@ ing or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original foto once you have saved the picture .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file save .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu file reco@@ vering the button Rec@@ order Regen@@ er@@ ate in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time .
virtually any action of the image processing can be rever@@ sible or restored . the last action you can re@@ configure , by re@@ viewing back@@ ver@@ ges or be restored by selecting re@@ work from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to reverse and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ turn @-@ old @-@ Z to re @-@ produce .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB on the back @-@ board or re @-@ kno@@ b button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you choose one of the menu @-@ items you will also have the actions set in between also back@@ ver@@ ted or restored .
once you start the picture editing , you can move between photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image r@@ unter , or the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can get in the photo and find out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the use menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can choose this button in the tool@@ bar : enlarge factor
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you usually come into the normal view . if you do not want this , you can change this in the dialog dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; change . these can call you out of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ er ; main window call . see this section for setting up the picture editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print some images or whole phr@@ ases . all images can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu item Ex@@ por@@ tiert Druck@@ ent . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and campaigns for the selected images . it is displayed , without the navigation treatments , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked :
multiple click on because same rider leaves the side@@ bar seem or again disappear into the edges .
in the cap@@ ri@@ ft@@ ment view , you can enter or insert signs using unlimited size . this means that all special characters are permitted . the complaint form are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are illustrated according to 2000 characters and special characters will be formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC tool@@ box in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented on , you will either take the button to apply or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the add @-@ button there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or database . but this will always be done if you &apos;ve chosen a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the images .
the section review presents an assessment of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and s@@ ings . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the side@@ bar or with the short@@ cut of C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating of the side@@ bar is always applied to a picture . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them from and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the en@@ coding follow the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the key@@ view reveals a search@@ box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; -@@ session ad@@ dic@@ ated keywords .
the key@@ tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given search word . you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have lots of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering the keywords in a picture series . if you have given various keywords , those are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the respective cross fields in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images selected at the main view , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection using a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar sample @-@ filter is used to change the selection of the display shown in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar will be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , casting , and search views . if in addition , one or more key@@ chain may be used from the right , only the cutting @-@ quantity of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and im@@ itate them . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and then select a dialog , which you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the top example the main window shows the images of a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords which have chosen the amount to three pictures . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right key@@ tree to the selection and put it there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled under settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule and have created and determine that it would be one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry according to which in the database is sear@@ ched . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a virtual search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the cross @-@ field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r were not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked at &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ controlled work@@ flow , the colors will use of your camera or scanner to have a predic@@ table devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ controlled work@@ flow , you can reach that colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner , and that the colors you print or publish in the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme centered on color administration , everybody has to express what buttons he wants to make for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration . in addition , you will provide you with deep background information to make your own informal decision making you get the desired results .
if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about the administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color tree . ( more information can be found below )
your only other images are by email or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everybody so easy , why should you use another color tree and therefore have to worry about paint @-@ hits ?
a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared with the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ re@@ lu@@ ous region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ ale represent@@ ations of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger colour show , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I bri@@ ckl@@ er my monitor if I have decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB paint room ?
yes ! if you &apos;re working in the s@@ R@@ GB paint room or not , you must finish your monitor succ@@ ession , since s@@ R@@ GB goes out that your ; on@@ itor operates at s@@ R@@ GB . so if you &apos;re working as a far@@ my@@ ard of s@@ R@@ GB , you need to use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , to use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool displays five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you try a further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , automatic , automatic de@@ equ@@ als and contrast to expand from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ d automatic correction automatically try to make the best out of your colours . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which affects the best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous negative values about the whole image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color grad@@ ations . this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or well @-@ washed .
ab@@ ast@@ ing : this method is read@@ ed the illumin@@ ator of the colors of the selected image , so that the Hist@@ ogra@@ m of the Int@@ ensity scope is as flat as possible . sometimes , the compar@@ ative very good results in improving the contra@@ sts of an image , sometimes it produces just tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonders in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic lock@@ ers : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . you can select the dark and bright border tones and read@@ ed the red , green and blue channels on the complete Hist@@ ogra@@ m .
re@@ ast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by the moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible field and a new ji@@ ust@@ ing of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in full pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ distance from &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white pe@@ es of a photo .
the white @-@ right correction is something limited because about a color tree can occur with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform too far from the original image , in case you can perform the white stor@@ ks in the tube mode , which means in the 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities are correct for correction better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ ary of copyright protected by Paw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym . you start it on the menu @-@ order colors white @-@ like picture editing .
the curtain range can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and preview of the tool . if you want to view the original white background , then click the sub@@ window .
the Pre@@ view of the target pictures has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ary of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the Hist@@ ogra@@ m .
to the right up , a hist@@ o@@ grams will display that dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameter . this story is very helpful , even in well illumin@@ ated pictures , most pixel very small L@@ umin@@ - values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ite .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow &apos;s shadow allows you to improve the shadow &apos;s ails of your photos or download them down .
v@@ stat with the above controls are to play , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image show to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white wash . this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically .
in addition , you can set the white @-@ right with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color canal is over@@ exposed .. you will have the combined result in the whit@@ ew@@ n indicated . this is shown in the th@@ umb@@ nails as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this . any adjustment of the whit@@ ew@@ drop you have set , you can save it into a text file and re@@ charge you again .
the kno@@ b settings sets all filter values again to their default values and the associated neutral whit@@ ew@@ s . note that also , neutral settings will be a different photo than your original image . if you save this , your original image is changed .
you can set here the codi@@ fication of the ordered image . 8 @-@ bit en@@ coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit en@@ coding is better for high @-@ quality images . these coding also requires more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands on@@ ly@@ able for the formats PNG , PN@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G available .
this tool opens the same dialog like the processing of color pictures . it uses the change and transfer of color profiles . colour ton@@ ing can be performed by the sub@@ window for the bri@@ ghtness . a det@@ ectable instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors Ton@@ oplast@@ y . this tool provides an integrated path to save multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always have the same correction . in the manual for key correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility of correc@@ ting problems is to correct the tool for Grad@@ ation that you can find below colors Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; dense ; tool Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ects gives you four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ een filter available .
in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ato , a effect of the evolved when installing some partially developed printing of a short light@@ ning . this had the effect that the ligh@@ ten areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to be easily aligned with this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar zation . at approximately 50 % intensity the image shows what chem@@ ically possible . a further increase is ultimately produced a negative image , that is not to be created on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the trademark of F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color can be made for the film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated paints are also some photo@@ graphic photographers , especially those most difficult landscapes are light .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ licht to the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the bri@@ ghtness of the result and the fe@@ ver re@@ ps the strength of the new@@ com@@ ts . in large images the filter allows the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can look for experimenting with the different Far@@ bas@@ ins of your photo with the tools in the menu . once you are happy with the result you will use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can get a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the envel@@ ope with bad lighting . in this case , the tool for bri@@ ghtness / s@@ ati@@ ation can reduce a good choice to perform the satur@@ ation rather than they can perform . if you can perform the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / Gamma is the tool key @-@ correction for improving the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated , you need to explain here the scope of the fe@@ ver . more concrete the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s .
the window contains a graph@@ s of the Int@@ ensity values , a hist@@ o@@ grams , of active can@@ als , or of the selected part@@ itions . under the graph@@ s are three fe@@ ver into the inside and can be moved to change the core values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the shelves to look at how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted , if the hist@@ o@@ gram is often represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images a digital camera is often domin@@ ating . in pictures the large areas of a constant color will domin@@ ates the linear hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ing of a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic entry .
three shelves : the su@@ preme for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently g@@ amma values .
the three color chains can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically set the input values of the shadow , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is an kno@@ b for full automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two regul@@ ators who can be used to change the output values interactive as with the input values . for example , the comp@@ ression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is in the foreground .
automatic : with this kno@@ b , the image values are automatically set depending on the Int@@ ensity values of the picture .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the files created in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded , the Gimp Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and use the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically read@@ ed for all shadows , means and Sundays . activate the paint cl@@ amps which you want to use and click on the th@@ umb@@ nails of the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ esc@@ ale channels .
the option of over@@ exposure indicators controls all channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modification : this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module :
beside this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
if you move for example a short trip to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones will be correspon@@ dent with dar@@ ker and for@@ ks the corresponding image text .
on the preview of original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ ings in the field you want to change will be a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is read@@ ed to your taste .
save as and loading : with this buttons , you can do exactly this . each bend that you have created may be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is that Gimp is generated .
if you want to create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all the channels of shadow , middle and sun@@ shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ v@@ v .
the option of over@@ exposure indicators controls all shades . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result shown . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in L@@ umin@@ si@@ can . shadow and sun@@ shades has been applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; dense ; image editing is a tool to improve the channels or change the color grad@@ ations of the photos .
the channel Mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel Mix@@ er of the picture editing .
with the channel @-@ selection box you can select the color for the story : this gives you a first hint about how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
preview the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the Hist@@ ogra@@ m to display you the corresponding resource value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you also retain the option of Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , as the channel Mix@@ er then DAS tool for generating great black and white con@@ versions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of one color is visible from the color canal which does not appear at the same point in the color canal and their smok@@ patterns will differ differently in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion in which you want to reduce the paint first .
the stor@@ ing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any any bl@@ ender setting you can save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel format .
the option of over@@ exposure indicators controls all channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been newly aligned . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action capability . with the development of digital photographs , black / white a work@@ horse , since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . even with a set of film rolls .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tration with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery images and fits perfectly well with portraits against heaven . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Grün@@ filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tration with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ il@@ ter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tering coating with a red lin@@ ens filter . this creates a dramatic nature effect and can sim@@ ulate moon material for day time . thus , similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ tration with a yellow link filter . this is the most natural color @-@ tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Yellow @-@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle tones while he adds a bit cold into the shadow of a print and the re @-@ development in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; dense ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your picture , irrespective of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the pin of an old master , a pop species from enlarged points or how a wall @-@ picture can apply on a wall . the menu item PHP application can be used for this .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper Tex@@ ture@@ ff@@ ekt has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and this changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; dense ; tool boxes can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stretching eye . under the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
type : with this parameter you make the desired size type for your image . thoroughly r@@ umped the image with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , cou@@ pled with a nice three @-@ dimensional framework of ideal for a button @-@ effects and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : sets the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ att@@ ed text in one image at any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text @-@ device , orientation , color out of color tree and character . you will be the drawing size of image size . the larger the image , the greater the character set . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . already , the image is ready .
any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button &quot; OK &quot; . after that picture has been stored , the text part of the picture . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ b tool , you can apply a sten@@ cil about an image .
the menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put an image via an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions or size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) to the reduction of file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil files ; simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; mail@@ ing@@ liste di@@ gi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have requested the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cil has been set appears a belly @-@ view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil and reflects the selection of a folder , the show@@ tim@@ eline is automatically updated .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlarged factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the above image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
decrease : this kno@@ cked below the underlying picture . it is centered on the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to the whole picture , you must cut the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the sten@@ cil . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your picture . the image will then be automatically adjusted .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; three different tools available for blade holders . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool to sound . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gran@@ ny images .
non@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask is working on the contrast the edges of a painting look like . actually , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric Dun@@ st and it makes a really good job . the algorith@@ m was made of Gimp and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ sign is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the shar@@ p@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in his application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most dig@@ iti@@ zed images need a correction of shar@@ ks . this in turn leads to a common colour together . that &apos;s in turn leads to a common colour together . the same phenomenon can be observed whenever h@@ ann@@ ers are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more bear@@ able vulner@@ abilities as normal cameras for the private user .
at JPEG @-@ pictures is often a camera internal shar@@ pen@@ ing applied . images in the pipe format are always required in the processing .
some scanner is already using a sc@@ aler image while reading the image . if you dis@@ able these de@@ activate , you get the control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by placing a photo with the Sch@@ är@@ fen @-@ Re@@ ver@@ ine . you can call it with the menu @-@ register of con@@ sp@@ ine shar@@ pen@@ ing .
they should be careful with this , as the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the shar@@ pen@@ ing of edges , but also intensi@@ fying the smoking . in general , the need technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image will ref@@ lex in the tool . you can reach it via the men@@ ding contract . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to cud@@ dle .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : one image is too cris@@ p . the solution to mark the picture a little soft , is much easier than it is too shar@@ pen@@ ed . use the tool for smo@@ other . use the tool for soft touch with the menu item and experiment with something with settings . it shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ hed is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview the image to edit . the preview feature shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should first try out . an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you make the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness masks to make strong , rust@@ ling and the impression of caves in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius poses a how many pixels on each side of a cann@@ ed by the filter are affected . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ os . you should therefore watch pictures most in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image one of the original is added . thus , the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the Corpor@@ a value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the use difference . one can therefore define a minimal difference thus for a channel of filters . in this way areas will be taken with a soft switch between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore avoid beauty faul@@ ts in faces , sk@@ ies and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited painting ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a thres@@ hold = 0.0 .
das &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool ref@@ ok@@ er re@@ focused one picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used to copyright infrin@@ gement / algorith@@ m by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focused on . this is better approach than just trying the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it usually makes better results than un@@ sharp mas@@ king . you can start it from the menu by calling colors ref@@ lex in the image editing .
in practice the circular prot@@ ru@@ ding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which depends far from the original source . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular shar@@ p@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular prot@@ ru@@ ding . it is the most important parameter to use this module . for most images the default value should set 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but then to be vit@@ alized .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.95 and 0,99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation is reduced the tough@@ er effect of the module .
smok@@ er filter : an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 but rarely useful . if the fil@@ tering filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 will the image quality is very poor . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still further poll@@ uted .
gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche &apos;s har@@ ness . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid res@@ ourc@@ eful arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / o@@ der@@ the smok@@ er filter .
mat@@ ress size : this value determines the size of trans@@ forms sm@@ atri@@ x . an increase in the mat@@ ure@@ size may cause good results , especially if you choose great value for the circular shar@@ pen@@ ters or the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen country . however , in most cases , you should choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ ing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any ref@@ lex parameters you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded later .
try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity en@@ co@@ ctions in the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read pictures and comp@@ ressing , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image .
generally produces un@@ sharp masks , better results than blades . this could be caused by the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king of a larger neighborhood than hus@@ ks .
theoretically , to be bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness . practical terms , the result of FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the Un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness Mas@@ ke . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better with the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ sharp color picture that has to be corrected . this picture was made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light to the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information about the methods of sc@@ aff@@ s in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ ät@@ te puts the ir@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the area of the fu@@ ck @-@ dark , in order to create a natural cleaner .
the color @-@ tin@@ te makes a adapted colour for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to not remove desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ a algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are shown below :
if you want to adjust the fil@@ tering settings , you can use the rider Gl@@ amping and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of details . a small value leads to a moderate up@@ grading over the image . a value of 0.9 should be sharp . a value of 0,9 should be obtained , that no shar@@ pen@@ ing is required . please note that the detail management always should be arranged .
alignment of the Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value added even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gr@@ itt or create C@@ CD Rau@@ schen will create a high value wav@@ eable patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best with a value close to 1 .
believing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor about all@@ es. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , you attach this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is prescribed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorith@@ m is through . usually , here 1 or 2 .
multi @-@ grad@@ ual integration of the an@@ isot@@ rop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , there should also be small . pay attention to that small angle to generate a long term . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral St@@ range &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral St@@ ride range in pixels . you should set the value small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel bal@@ ing and never greater than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More about quality that you get through the choice of this option is only minor . he then doubled the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to release him .
the buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this . any adjustment of images error can be stored in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
images error is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still be very long and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can see how graphical errors have been removed with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is made on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar warm art act in the foreground , that is caused by a bad film break@@ down during the trip is wur@@ del@@ .@@ The original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; smoke @-@ reduction is a very powerful tool to ru@@ b images . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorith@@ m by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool establishes a sel@@ ectable machine filter available to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts , e.g. by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ory from the camera or mo@@ i@@ ber@@ ute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor screw from digital cameras , so you can check them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ting smok@@ er that can be successful with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced configuration settings may remain in the standard settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can switch the image . by the radius is moving through the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ ap@@ e@@ gel . this value puts the pix@@ el@@ der@@ up to determine the filter changes . you may need to re@@ define the edges of the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and rust@@ ling or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the ch@@ imp@@ rec@@ ision for the har@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be the whole noise , or smoke @-@ tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a sh@@ aking noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ osity of the picture . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance to change to a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process by the details .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process by the details .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ ble tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically ou@@ trag@@ ed stronger , but it is also the shadow of shadow .
absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is responded to . if it &apos;s increased , the edges of the edges can occur . if it is too high , smoke and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . he can remove smoke @-@ tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the process reduction you have set , can be saved into the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how long @-@ reduction of your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and this corrected with ( 2 ) , which is applied with standard settings .
sometimes an image is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to mark the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than one image to raise . use the tool for smo@@ other with the menu item and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . it shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; photo rest@@ art is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter to rest@@ art gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts , movie gr@@ ins , scr@@ at@@ ches , comp@@ ression , comp@@ ression , and local errors that arise in digital , original or det@@ ri@@ mental images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the image styles and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tures , with a different tool , the image error correction , executed . the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ c and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts may reduce : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a dist@@ ressing comp@@ ression or quot ; - small standards that are shown in the un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this attitude is intended to correct such problems .
the buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this . each adjustment of photo rest@@ ration can be saved into a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo rest@@ art is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to get off . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped smok@@ es , .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensation of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film@@ strip on the faces . you can see the original image below ( 1 ) and this corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo rest@@ art . this time tex@@ tures has been reduced to an old color photo which has been applied with a scanner which has been created with a scanner , and the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
das &amp; di@@ gi@@ kam ; tool hot@@ text allows to remove photos taken with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it is using algorithms from the J@@ PEG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression over a built @-@ built oppression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light pix@@ el@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file into the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button image . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to discover the dark &apos;s image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by C@@ CD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark @-@ image will find the bad pixels . please note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads the next session .
the image area and preview you can correct within the image the result . the preview feature shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all pre@@ ables .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels in the preview and the results of the filter . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ish this pix@@ el@@ card . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ section : it is determined a average of the neighborhoods . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional Inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ els which have a gap of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block , are pulled to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ tering method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block are moved , to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cu@@ bic cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ text correction on a color photo , out of a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to . the original image has increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ us ; Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ stic correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ et@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed places , an image .
expan@@ se objective , in particular that in the middle and large photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire Sensor@@ Range . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective shows may also be this behavior .
but it also has cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Bl@@ ending filter , which it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . vast@@ ly objective should , even using center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , since otherwise imm@@ in@@ effective effects arise by motion .
with the large expos@@ ing of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by simul@@ ated by an equi@@ val@@ ente transformation on a raw image which is being used without this filter . the tool Vign@@ et@@ ti@@ stic correct is applied to an image . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three shelves you can control the vig@@ or filters and take three more the exposure to target audience .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light generating the filter at the point of the biggest density . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a sound setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , ent@@ ru@@ pt@@ .@@ increases the density to compens@@ ate for a bigger degree of vig@@ or , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a little degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma @-@ settings : the mach@@ ining of an image with the vig@@ or correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ define the exposure to target image with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values available as you only need to increase settings .
if you want a fin@@ er real@@ y of the target audience , so let the values for illumin@@ ate / contrast / Gamma during zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; picture editing of the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the vig@@ or correction to one image applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the mot@@ if@@ ying in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; Lin@@ sen@@ ver@@ dist@@ or@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of cel@@ er@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses such copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m of David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric for@@ f@@ eit@@ ing . colored dist@@ or@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades treats the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ .exe form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third ridge has a similar round @-@ effect , flat but at the edges . this correction is not being used in the tool .
the Ko@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the distant corners for the opposite of the second Gr@@ ades . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion of the second Gr@@ ades . with negative values , tons of per@@ ver@@ b can be corrected and positive values can be con@@ cre@@ sted dist@@ or@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls , the &apos; bracket parameter has the um@@ med sign of the parameter ) .
Zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction first gr@@ ades through . negative values increase while positive the image is smaller .
bright : this value cle@@ ared the bri@@ ghtness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the bri@@ ghtness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
in order to help you find the best fil@@ tering settings , the dialog with a preview the dist@@ or@@ tion correction . the values that you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values .
the correction or con@@ cre@@ atively correction should be performed prior to all Zu@@ schnei@@ der or size changes . in case you cut a picture new and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious .
to help you find the best correction line , this tool provides you a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse button to fix the lines in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ ell@@ ar / con@@ cre@@ atic aber@@ ration with the help of the lines .
if you correct a con@@ cre@@ atively dist@@ or@@ tion , the resulting image black corners . you can transform them using the accessory tool in the menu , cut out of the image processing , or over the z@@ oom Reg@@ ler to remove this dialogue .
for most images the tonn@@ age goes down . the next logical step for some motives , such as photos from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all the angles in the image 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction is applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ ared @-@ film the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u website of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org Website . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensation of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window you can select the area for preview for preview . if you move the red rectang@@ le with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters set up film gran@@ ularity and film @-@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the ISO Reg@@ ler changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transforming . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter color @-@ channels to re@@ produce infr@@ ared film mis@@ ses , particularly the green @-@ channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos , since the color @-@ information is missing .
this is an example of infr@@ ared @-@ cin@@ emat@@ ography applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the cutting edge .
the &amp; dense ; filter film gran@@ ularity is a simple to use device to re@@ produce film gran@@ ularity in your images . this is known of classic high @-@ speed filters , such as B / W K@@ od@@ ak Tri @-@ X . to increase the sens@@ itiveness of the films the manufacturers great silver gra@@ ins of photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the movie &apos;s gra@@ ff@@ ect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to post@@ p@@ one in the past . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street pictures , especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the Kör@@ ner . the default value is , although higher values are required , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more kern@@ els , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the movie &apos;s body available on a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed ( 2 ) . the film @-@ sensitivity is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; dense ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to affect this effect . the top cho@@ oses the p@@ est size between one and five . th@@ icker brush are better suited for large images . smooth controls the glasses or , from the other side , looked at the char@@ ity .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and which edited is marked with the ( 2 ) . the original size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and gl@@ assy 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses paint and int@@ ens@@ ability to define a coher@@ ence in the drawing . therefore images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ating yourself . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper shelves choose the foundation size and the lower read@@ ed the contrast ( gl@@ oss ) .
this is an example of the drawing @-@ pass filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default image of 30 and 10 were used . the result may be further enhanced by adjust@@ ing the Int@@ ensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter engra@@ ving your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amp@@ ed in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour does not use the most important at the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ey@@ ed landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a artwork by dist@@ or@@ tions , it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and makes it look like it is looked upon by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 is dist@@ orted to the picture here with another version of glass b@@ loc@@ s .
some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of non@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom U@@ bl@@ i : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture along glob@@ ular lines that origin@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography .
radi@@ al im@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture by rotating the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of a revol@@ ver camera .
removal : bl@@ ur@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to emerge in the background .
movement bl@@ ur@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear mot@@ if@@ ying , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft mark : hidden the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle energy .
sho@@ oter : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
smart bl@@ ur@@ ness : finds the color @-@ pool in the image and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the picture in rectangular cells and then creates it with filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and do a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops in your image . this gives it natural your images a good look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of the dri@@ ps to change . since the dri@@ pping size does not automatically increase with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the quantity and density of dro@@ pping . fish is changing the optical effect of the drops in the picture .
you can use the &amp; dense ; picture editing an area free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ ine fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by spi@@ res or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be transformed into the menu transform or transform it .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to waste is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image infl@@ atable when the limits of dis@@ solution can be achieved ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below .
to change the tool in size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
lots of image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo infl@@ atable was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available at the rider New size and are recorded below :
aspect ratio : when this adjustment is enabled , the entry of the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is prescribed , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons are used as and loading are used accurately . each setup for photo can be saved as a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel calculation at any time with the button be@@ ad .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable , by increasing a small image image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear default penis for comparison .
the bra@@ kes of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to form a picture . to cut a photo with the mouse just throw the rectang@@ le with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectang@@ le , create . you will then see this rectang@@ le then check the mouse move .
if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change a good overview of your photo according to the cutting edge , by moving to the corners of the rectang@@ le . simply create a new rectang@@ le by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cross @-@ section , use the button @-@ cutting button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file sali@@ va or file stor@@ ing in the menu file to store the newly opened photo .
in the background , you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by changing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialogue remains .
in the tool after aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as high format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of width will be assigned .
the tool after aspect ratio is a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see for example a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
bottom in the dialog , you can set with the Max . relationship kno@@ b the area to access the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the screen @-@ orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you are using the inter@@ sec@@ ting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the modified images are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the open image and not the original image .
the settings of the implementation support allow it to be in@@ sured , so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party gel , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles have a possibility to share a rectang@@ le in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles into the di@@ agon@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth pattern as for example the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy , or the blood leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we find as beautiful .
the Golden division is the ir@@ ration@@ ale number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who made their tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have put together the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number leads from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from , where each number is equal to the sum of its two prec@@ eding numbers . the resulting part is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the Golden Mitte . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center represents smooth service lines when you put an image below . these help are re@@ cl@@ ed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you better results for your photos . compared to third @-@ party gel , the Golden Spir@@ ale creates a liquid line of the eye to follow through the image along the line of the spiral along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
a further rule are the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the Golden Spir@@ ale , also called Golden reef . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also guided from the top of the Golden Tri@@ angle . your ver@@ ti@@ ces are the central points of the golden tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles , no equivalent tri@@ angles and tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ally placed on these lines can place a static object dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create a effect of professional photo grapher Dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your picture battery in one of the cut@@ ters and other visual information in the tri@@ angles and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve .
the options Horiz@@ ontal mirror and Vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxili@@ ary lines can be invisible . this way you can adapt the color of lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you &apos;re not exactly ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates an image in which things are fil@@ med for an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; dense ; image processing and tool free rotation . choose free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the module is free rotation and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to position the two lines . after you have moved it through an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you shot a picture you will find unwanted fe@@ eder holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function transform into use from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is a Autom@@ atically Zu@@ cut . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation . keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tive transform@@ ations are carried out around one fix@@ point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red Quad@@ rate at the corners of your image . th@@ umb@@ nails will then automatically be re@@ calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information which can help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation occurs in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation occurs in pixels .
angle from the top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of transformed area .
following the adaptation of the perspective the picture gets a little poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation is this effect small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you acqu@@ ered the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way of getting this is the picture with transformed sugar cutting out of the image processing .
the activation tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite . it is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectang@@ le is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module into transform .
push your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press on preference , the angles on zero will be set . a preview of effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the front line .
with your help , a vertical and horizontal line ends . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the activation tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the p@@ adding , the image will be a bit wast@@ ed . for a single shift this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two per@@ dings can be dro@@ pping twice as much wis@@ er and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ et@@ ching , the picture has un@@ nice tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to transform the picture with transform plu@@ cked out of the image processing .
&amp; Pres@@ ent came ; takes a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats , but you will always be JPEG and TI@@ FF among them .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; displays only files in formats to the know . this happens upon the extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can edit this list of file reports , you can change . in the section configuration you will find more information about this .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format used . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression to digital pictures . thereby , red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced to store in this way the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG with the same comp@@ ression relation . the 200@@ 0s can also save free when this is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the rough format , you can read among Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert video format images into JPEG or TI@@ FF by the Roh@@ wed@@ ter von &amp; di@@ gi@@ arrived ; convert . in section configuration you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; .

all images processing tools such as har@@ dened , so@@ othing , so@@ othing , ref@@ oc@@ ating , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc . . use a unified dialog type , which is applied to the current image below . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : the progress of the filter at the current image shows the status of the filter at the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the un@@ transm@@ itter of the fore@@ viewer . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter to be applied to the right of the selected pre@@ view .
horizontal divide them without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top area shows the original and the lower shows the filters applied to the area below the selected pros .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ eme ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; software program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ eme ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ eme ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s newly re@@ counting and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ eme . )
menu , to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ eme ; in a &amp; Kate ;
loading of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; b ; -@@ program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window shows the opening graph@@ s , each in your own window . initially , if you start &amp; c@@ graph@@ viewer , the main window will open only the icon file and the ( empty ) list included . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files have selected the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview will appear in the corner , when the graph is larger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or let this position automatically .
the mouse wheel use ( high and r@@ less without extra buttons , left and right at pressing &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the straight file has been modified in a different program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose if the graph want to be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can change your decision later , you can set your decision later , you can set the menu item configuration items ; see also .
when you open a graphics outside of an ongoing &amp; user viewer ; g in a browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; user viewer , or want to present the loaded graph@@ s in a sub@@ window of already running instance .
as with the latest option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog .
at the program start you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both and later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use several pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph@@ s , which appear on a page , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the respective parts of the graph@@ s .
page preview with one on several pages shared graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font
the page again store gives the possibility to set the behaviour when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically loading or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the site opens the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ eme . you can set a standard behavior outside of a current session . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window ) or determine in a window of already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site administration site gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set up a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opening up more options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for judicial graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or historical depic@@ tions of graph@@ ed graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then trying to produce as short edges and as few ben@@ ches .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ trained graph@@ s . it produces depic@@ tions according to the jumping @-@ spring model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorith@@ m is used , the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m generated for un@@ law@@ ed graph@@ s a jumping @-@ template -@@ layout . he uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ Heu@@ rist@@ ik , and includes a multi @-@ honey@@ moon for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image and edit . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ casting of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed on a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools available to locate images geograph@@ ically in spher@@ ical Co @-@ system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , to locate . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in the g@@ px @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS equipment .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization cor@@ relation . this interface can combine a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above mentioned dialog will then download . to load a possible cor@@ relation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to download a trace file with G@@ P@@ X file . this file contains of course data the same time taken at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file loaded an automatic cor@@ relation performed , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS Track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera age must be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera age . if the diver@@ gence from below are the data gathered together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ px file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ish and difference in min. can be used if you do not have a suitable data . if you know that in reality is a loc@@ ation in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can set this boundaries here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ish .
the coordinates can be set with this dialog . this is useful when you have a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog de@@ struct the coordinates from one call to the next one you just have to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
location can also be found and set @-@ up . select the area and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Run this again and again through until you have reached a continuous accuracy . the card can always be selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums at a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can choose the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to make the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders where the settings may be adjusted . you don &apos;t need to select all the albums matching to HTML . you don &apos;t need these albums only . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly check a large number of albums on the right , including the Al@@ ben@@ schau and the text which will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each picture gets an image created . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in the image below . otherwise , the image is displayed directly with your standard screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have written permission . a sub@@ folder with the name KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have chosen the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF @-@ Information of your original pictures are also stored in the new pictures .
with another color @-@ depth , you can change the default color @-@ depth . it naturally influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the rider &apos;s paintings allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the photo@@ graphic images , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module created the pages is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program fe@@ eds to determine if errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press closing to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ betra@@ chter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to look at images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ betra@@ chter allows him to look at a selection of images and perform the basics such as la@@ ches , zo@@ oming or tw@@ ist . the viewer can be used with short moist@@ uri@@ zed and cra@@ fted . he was developed for quick display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in the full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG comp@@ uting module is a tool to change pictures without inter@@ f@@ ere with your quality .
this module allows to store files in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality and met@@ adata .
the consequence of the free storage is that the file size is rising , since no comp@@ ression of the color @-@ form@@ ations occurs . this can be found e.g. in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to combine your machine with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org. For : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module , currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import of the met@@ adata function you can copy data from one image to another . simply select the file @-@ selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you have to copy the met@@ adata so that the data is copied after you have pushed the button OK .
this function does not work with all images formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any destination format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , convert . this module uses the packages M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can insert a base material in MP@@ 2 or WAV the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose a back@@ color for the slides . with this module , it is possible to create DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medi@@ ums you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images that can be packed into MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can create the module for extras : Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected are then reported on image files in the portfolio . there you can also change s@@ orting the images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . if you plan to re@@ connect the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV Standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the one picture is shown below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high on the top change of image change .
the color @-@ color can be set next . in doubt you should let it be black . the name and path of the generated file you can specify the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind the du@@ ck @-@ off .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the film . after all settings are adapted to your wishes , you can start with the button code to drink the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your b@@ ills you can quickly leave a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au when you are back .
if an indication appears that Ko@@ di@@ zer or Tools will be missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ J@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Packages with the button settings right down .
the printer assistant allows you to print several images on a piece of paper together in default sizes . the combined images can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command@@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . ein original z@@ itat von Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw files which should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ Bild@@ converted window appears then in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now optimize the values to optimize the conver@@ gence process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings may be used for the whit@@ eboard . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , bri@@ ghtness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjustable . if the result is not optimal , you can proceed to the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches is no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the fil@@ ename remains identical and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a lu@@ ct@@ less algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free LZ@@ W comp@@ ression .
in case you are going to process your images often or you later go otherwise in advance , you should not choose the JPEG format before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ing . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you want to select as storage format the met@@ adata that are included in the RAW file are contained in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted to your settings , you can start downloading the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use this process .
the for@@ kli@@ ft @-@ processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode therefore when you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have here the possibility of existing file automatically re@@ writing . this is helpful in case they have been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . however , the progress report indicates how far the conversion is prog@@ ressed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and tim@@ est@@ amps which should be used .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a file collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge the image or enlarge .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the orientation orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 d@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
pressure preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , boundary size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the desired image before . further images can be drawn to the list of fine images and put it there .
after which you started the module will display the images window frames displayed by you . on the button images , you can add additional pictures with a file @-@ choice dialog . for the last selected image , a preview on the right is displayed .
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and add it to adding the list of images to be displayed .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of fine images .
once you have selected all images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected are attached already as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to send email to the size of the E @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send a number of emails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time it is used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ Mail@@ agent on your computer beforehand . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are attached to a text file and the mail is attached .
the PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted among the free @-@ free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you want to select under pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format , then the original command data will be added to the sen@@ den@@ ds pictures .
when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so you can see the status messages , looking for errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button closing , you can sch@@ y this window .
after the launch of the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appears a window with questions like you have shown your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the pictures selected from you and all pictures of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option OpenGL trans@@ itions in the presentation use very elegant image trans@@ itions using OpenGL . however , you don &apos;t have to possess a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename option show that the fil@@ ename will appear in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the v@@ eil option makes it possible to display the presentation in an end@@ off loop . you can manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images happen to be selected by chance that the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
under delay between the pictures can be set the temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should so check out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen state @-@ effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , cho@@ oses a different effect during each transition between the pictures .
during Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool@@ bar you can rest@@ art the presentation and start again , to the previous and the next picture , and stop the slides .
at the left of the screen you can see the current date names , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module book Time &amp; Date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org. For : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module background picture is a tool to set a picture as a wall@@ paper for the working space .
this module is using the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE working surface .
once you have provided your images and videos with editorial , you can look with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords items found .
in the browser window you will see the categories , which you have given information to look at your pictures and videos . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , viewing the latest fashi@@ ons . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture .
if you choose another person , only the images are displayed on which both individuals can be seen . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images to a few thousand images on some single pictures .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view the photos to look at the images of your field .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but for each person you can store its own image image , This also applies to places , keywords , and other categories which you have defined .
to view images apart from the name , select the button which is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the apparent context menu , you can select the view that you can view each category for each category ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must define yourself which image for each person is to be shown . to display this , you have to select the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in case you can select the image factor according to your preferences and select what part of the image will be displayed and cut off .
if you call the entry in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is similar to the dialog for the celebration of Bild @-@ Properties . this dialog allows you to see on the picture once more .
if you wish to enter a po@@ inter to the box type or description , the complaint and descriptions of the images are sear@@ ched for . if you wish , you can also enter a date for which to be sear@@ ched ; the date can either be part of the total dat@@ as , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images , on which Jes@@ per , however , not Anne Hel@@ ene are formed .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the fast entry , the screen pictures and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry . as a result , some examples are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an extended HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , take a look at the tim@@ eline . a picture of this p@@ est look here : . as the name suggests , this lin@@ ux shows you fil@@ tering statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each one will then show a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing out only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can edit the displayed preview View from the database ( if you select a date , you will see the first image of this date in th@@ umb@@ nails , and also displays the tim@@ eline always the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will be displayed in the preview view only pictures of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; displays you two options available to create HTML pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following part of the user manual , the installed in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , which you can create over the menu file ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following each area is described more exactly .
first , enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages , you will see an example of these settings .
next select you to see if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file will be created , which is to see on the review page . approxim@@ ate information about the export files you will find in .
finally , you can choose which information is shown on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed at the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . please note that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , why this is not specifically made .
at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions to the images and possess a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can be downloaded , for example , a resolution of 1600@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified . thus , your images can be seen with low resolution , which will result in a shorter transmission time , and if he wants to display a picture larger , he will switch to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you specify the different folder and the URL where your website is stored .
best to select for all your HTML files , select a base folder and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and you can select for all future pictures of the location . here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if this really is visible for viewers . if you choose the base of a URL , after the pages have been created , started . the URL you should specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you must manually copy it . to ensure the import function , see , properly functions you need to specify the final aim of the files , but the base folders in which all sub@@ folders are .
the just described settings are covered by all three on base folders and UR@@ Ls . in this one sub@@ folder , whose name you specify in the file folder .
if you &apos;re looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already been telling a lot of time for viewing the images , people on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ kim file . you can import them into your database . the picture features will be imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ kim -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in the file , whether the images are stored in the file , or whether the images are stored in the file , that you have all the images together and thus sharing this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ kim file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ kim file together with a HTML file , this is an external .@@ kim file .
an external .@@ kim file is searching the images in two @-@ fold way . first , the images are not found , so the images of the URL , which you have specified when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ kim file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for the ex@@ porting images described you can call via the menu file Ex@@ por@@ ate ...
the main option of this dialog is whether to act in order to act internal or external .@@ kim files . the following three options are available :
with the option manual near the .@@ kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ kim file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option to copy the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kim file copy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ kim -@@ files are normal Zip @-@ files . since most images are already associated with JPEG comp@@ ressed and the XML file itself is worthwhile if you want to get this anyway , just choose the option export file comp@@ ressed .
the last option of this site is maximum image size limit . if you want to send your friends photos , because the .@@ kim file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by example , for example , that each image has a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ kim from the web browser or from the menu file imports ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to Im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category persons interested to import@@ ing file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called in your database . therefore , you will be able to import the categories of imported file and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can choose the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example will see you on the picture .
it must be easy to browse pictures to browse and look at : when you see images , one wants to see often inside different pic@@ ut@@ ches &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this hand@@ book you will take the different steps from ( 1 ) consoli@@ dating the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the gateway and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adapt@@ ations through .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the management of your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ pp@@ y or re@@ visions at the CV@@ S , where they would like .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used again at the future start . if you want to read another database tree with images , you can start using the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu sub@@ contracting settings ; set up ... you will come to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following sections of the user manual , you will be explained the different settings .
left you see six different symbols with which you can access settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each adjustment stands a detailed help available , which you can call through a button print on the F1 button and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can specify for each image different qualities , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like items , animals or albums .
on the view you see the dialog , which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog Options you can set up full members , i.e. all members of one group at once in a group , rather than explained all the groups of a bank membership .
in view you will see the settings options available to you . with the top @-@ indicated selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left @-@ box , a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ Kam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system means K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . seam@@ lessly information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have however a help page that you can view over the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by multiple applications with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo recordings are always tested first with the demo album , before you visit them on your own pictures . demo album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ path \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via IP@@ I , are very different , making it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can use their images in albums : here , there is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , so you can sim@@ ulate the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
here are simul@@ ated &amp; cold album : the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture preview .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also has to pass a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photographer &apos;s browser ; s browser displayed in the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category is an album of the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you want to use the category &apos; category &apos; , then do so if you would have selected people and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible are you can remove them from the list of modules . start the dialog dialog , and select in the module modules that are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a boot screen , once you start your photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , you can &apos;t find a lot of information , since you still have no information about your pictures . in the section , we will look back to this window , then click on the entry page , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see each image with notes . on the picture , where the image has been included , you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per , you can see all images in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for viewing and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you see three lists with a text box by selecting individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as you will always use them again if you input information about your pictures .
the following idea is the re@@ loc@@ ating the images inside the list : if you have for example a family @-@ party and shown at all 50 frames the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , so that the used names are moved up@@ wards to find the people faster and arrange .
if you prefer to get a alphab@@ e@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for s@@ orting the date under the list .
if you have selected any remarks on each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with comments . click in this case simply on the front and back buttons , which are shown at the picture of the picture on the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item for multiple entries at one time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the US as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an overview , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the acquisition di@@ alog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also draw an entry into a category and put it there in order to sort this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this requires that you just sort your categories alphab@@ e@@ tically .
you can move the different elements of the item of particular , by form the gl@@ ue that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by pul@@ ling it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the button options ... which offers you the opportunity to store up the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and here window one / exit . this procedure can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry image in the browser you &apos;ll get an overview with demonstration of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filters to be set here . you can configure the size of the display images , by simply down the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easily .
when you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is furnished as a background for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will display in the picture record . if you have not yet opened a window with a photo display , a new ad scan will be displayed .
you can also delete images from the image preview . simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete or select either the Rem@@ ove button or select in the menu edit menu . now , the window will display you in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you for this problem a solution . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can also have the pictures stored anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if not all necessary images can be loaded from the disk .
images , where the right upper edge is cut is not stored on the hard disk . so , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the views are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture viewed .
as you see , this function requires that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it . if you would like to avoid the inser@@ ting of the respective CD . if you want to avoid the inter@@ tw@@ ist of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you can find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little bit of privacy , you want to stay in the end ones you want to see for others and click on the Current View locks in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the pictures that may see your little sister , w@@ ax@@ ing and w@@ aging the menu item Alles except contemporary view .
there@@ for you have fixed which pictures in the case of the case shall be hidden . if you want to lock the laptop with your little sister , you just choose the menu @-@ related images , which you will have locked up . if you want to view the images again , click on spar@@ se .
it is also possible to set a password which must be dis@@ closed for the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . at one point you can access or delete the password as an un@@ encryp@@ ted text using the password as an un@@ encryp@@ ted text only . those type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours with it is of course you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . for this reason , features a picture _ and video recordings . this allows you to preview from the preview , as described in .
the viewer may see you in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , so you can easily drag it with the mouse and elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . this then cli@@ pping context menu you can see below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the appropriate entries to this page . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images from Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as di@@ asch@@ au . however , then a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus . started and stopped using the Di@@ asch@@ au by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability to switch from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to the full screen mode .
if you use the viewer , you can get in the picture and get out zo@@ oming . with the minus button you can get back r@@ ins@@ zo@@ oming The plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rectang@@ le indicates , and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ om@@ t . with the equation @-@ key puts the zo@@ oms , so that every pixels with the screen corresponds to the image of the image .
keep in mind that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that fall in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and min@@ st@@ aste .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the actual picture with the menu item from the context menu .
if you can look at images it may happen that you may have forgotten an image with a person whose name you may forget to look at the image and open the configur@@ ations dialog of the image to insert this name . however , you will be able to mark the image and consider further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start watching the viewer with the pictures and start it as good or bad while you &apos;re looking at one by one .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer &apos;s option to show some features while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters . in view , see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you want to edit them in your browser , just print them all at once using notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want .
categories and special features can be shown in the view view . if you want to display categories in D@@ re Pre@@ view , then you can press features to the images by simply press the letter for the characteristic when the image was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on an image . for that case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . the way you can rever@@ t your gem@@ on later .
in the picture you can see an image on the painted game . to switch the painting mode by &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . to finish the painting menu from the context menu . to end the M@@ alen you simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you must not control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you should be read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wi@@ re@@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the items already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the item you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the tool@@ bar menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be built , so that you can choose the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under mach@@ ining or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed characteristics , click on to apply these changes . have inv@@ ali@@ d values indicated , a message telling a fault description indicated . then you can correct the input text and apply again or put the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to the Pov@@ ray ; -@@ user @-@ documentation in the dialog dialog , you can visit the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with the help visit .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can view a preview in the individual &apos;s own views .
press on preview in the peculi@@ ar view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture . as default , the whole texture is selected , even if you just want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture Map ) , you cross locally .
the screens@@ hot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can pull these check@@ points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation , as well as the position for shi@@ fts . you can change the shift through bri@@ ds with the mouse within the entire window .
every object appears as a wire model a visual level . you can indicate this value relative to the level @-@ level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only be shown when they are selected or their visual ampli@@ fier small or the same in the tool@@ bar of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window orders or if you need a different arrangement , you can use them freely . you can also store multiple lin@@ ders and simply switch between different regulations .
to an@@ chor a window on or under a view , drag the beginnings at the top or bottom of a view . a rectang@@ le then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then ancho@@ red on the right or left side of that view and covers the overall height .
if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the beginnings in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the cardboard box top in the views .
the last possible window order form a web@@ ting views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from an@@ chor , drag the beginning on the desktop or click on the small to the left at the top left in the bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the bar &apos;s bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu , you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are ch@@ att@@ ing , you can an@@ chor them to any user .
the current window view can save you with view window order ... save it . it will display a dialog in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : use &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; Version 1.0 not supported .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item scene scene .
one R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of high quality levels .
if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar , or select &quot; R@@ ender Mod@@ i &quot; menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can input any name , but sense is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you only want to ren@@ ame a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section down@@ side and give the picture cut to ren@@ dering into the input field .
in the drop @-@ down field , you can select the characteristics which are used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex non @-@ diff@@ user ref@@ lex@@ ions @-@ illumin@@ ation . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is struc@@ ted with only one ray depending on the pixels , these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or ste@@ pl@@ ess effect in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
the Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sam@@ pling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sam@@ pling rests with each other . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel continues to be split up and adap@@ tive because the Rec@@ order version depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray identi@@ fies a beam per pixel . if the difference between shades of a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sam@@ pling are processed . if you adjust the low value to 4 , a gr@@ ating of 4x4 points will be calculated , at a low value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated following : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays of pixels . if the difference between colours are divided the pre@@ defined thres@@ hold , the pixels will be divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which will be pursued individually further and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of record can be set with the low value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is called J@@ itter@@ ing process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , changing and Pov@@ ray ; the rays order for a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use ré@@ lex@@ ion . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light @-@ reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to let a scene with this feature .
on this map card you can indicate whether the Alpha @-@ channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is then transparent , if the associated rays are not made an object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expected , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ scene to import , select the menu item file to import ... and choose a file from the Colum@@ ns window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : not yet the complete command of the Pov@@ ray of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . when regi@@ stering error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support implementation in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , please write this code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can draw objects from the object @-@ tree into the editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . to import objects in the Editor . to import objects in the scene , just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it to the object @-@ tree .
cop@@ ying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor , you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : a scene in ren@@ dering . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the ownership view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user @-@ documentation for the displayed object . here you can find the path to your documentation and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example measurement data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if you include files which are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for the display of the selected checks points .
the colour of the rectang@@ le for the field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
you can adjust the object @-@ start of the points to the re@@ ster in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model &apos;s view . you can adjust the edges for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and fil@@ ings .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the indicated objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed stages for two directions .
if you cross High Detailed view for extended proj@@ ections , all the wi@@ re@@ model &apos;s views are further divided , if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering ren@@ dering .
when you cross wall , a wall behind the objects will be crossed . the wall is depic@@ ted in a chess column , consisting of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a floor is struc@@ ted below objects . the ground is depic@@ ted in a chess column , consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you want to activate the ch@@ asing order , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and thres@@ hold may be set . more exact details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section .
on this page you can modify existing window ordin@@ ances or create new window ordin@@ ances . in the section window arrangement will explain how you can create and store lin@@ ders .
the drop @-@ down field standard console : displays all available window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
the list of window frames displays all available window ordin@@ ances . a new arrangement can set you with the button added and ext@@ ingu@@ ish a selected order with the button distance .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be added with the button to create and delete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with monsters , you &apos;ll get a cardboard box together with the previous view and flo@@ ating view not in the main window but creates a separate window .
you just have just &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no closer knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , to be very popular : a ball on one layer .
but you should carefully notice the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you adjust no camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you make no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , following vo@@ icing Rules :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item references . you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model display shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the scene of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will find the content of the view object , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find out more details .
change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view points , simply click with the left mouse button on a cone point and drag it to the desired location .
when you apply the button , or press the input paste , change the wi@@ re@@ model &apos;s views and the object @-@ tree instantly according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting physique qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a comprehen@@ sible method of resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : does indeed offer a simple option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object @-@ tree , change the name and push the button use or the input paste . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model also indicates the level , even if at the moment only as a limited @-@ scale level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the layer extends to the horizon .
if you can look at the object tree , you will notice that you click on the icon + before the object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the different parameters for each object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the sky@@ line so you can get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as below :
only choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the property tree . you can view the name in the peculi@@ arities view ( name = ground @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you look like the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a Matt@@ es black material because you can check settings for pig@@ ment . therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on th@@ umb@@ nails . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you do not see color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if your image is now running with a click on the icon , you should get the following results :
of course , this is not the colour you expect . here are further settings necessary . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called paint colors . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object @-@ tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to run out , since you have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , which can be understood just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the inter@@ c@@ aste or the button to press ) so that the ball has float above the ground , since you have moved the ground by one unit to the bottom .
of course , the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball surface is like a Matt@@ es black fabric . put the following step of the suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can as@@ sign it to a material right now . as already in the floor , enter the sphere a pig@@ ment as colour :
select Er@@ stes sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select a color and make the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on to apply or press the input .
the settings shine @-@ effect and ref@@ lex@@ ion features already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; gre@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ arios is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you trace a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the observer ( d. h. by the camera , which will reflect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and like atmosph@@ eric effects such as fo@@ g . thus , the scene Pixel for pixels worked .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is supposed to be rolled , some light sources and at least a camera .
in the usual dialog dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard dialog dialog , you can select a file that you have previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu , and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already have saved the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
displays the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last storage are changed .
this menu item you can only select if you have not saved up @-@ to @-@ date changes in the scene .
repeated the last re@@ ver@@ ted command . this menu item you can only select when you have used rep@@ airing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing order arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , &quot; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut unit . you can change or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool @-@ ons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
a plat@@ former map is a way to pre@@ di@@ fy the surface without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ eled and without change the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
plots are simple geomet@@ rical shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from do@@ zens of do@@ zens of do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , by using a image file as a color card .
&amp; copper show ; is a comfortable machine visu@@ als and navig@@ ator . the application has a browser browser in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the use of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; printer browser &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very simple . the file navig@@ ator lists files you can click on clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ MB@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button ; or the key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Return &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can adjust if each picture is to be displayed in your own window , or if all photos are supposed to use the same window .
if you are searching for a certain file you just type the first sign of the fil@@ ename in the right corner . when a password file has been found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressures of Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog set @-@ up - &amp; h@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cardboard cards . in three of them , General and processing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two other , short commands for the browser , the key@@ boards can be defined for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the pictures are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the indicator is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . pres@@ et is not a full screen mode .
this point is activated , invites &amp; h@@ ick@@ show ; already look at the next image in the folder , while you still watch the current picture . this reduces the delay whenever you choose the next image and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; h@@ ick@@ show ; by reve@@ aling the name of the last opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the coloured beams to select a wall@@ paper . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the image is , also the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; spher@@ es , so that only a few of the file types will be displayed , which the program may also represent .
with this option the ad scan will be enlarged on the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
determine whether the slideshow with the first image in the folder or the selected image should start .
the time @-@ span between the image changes in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions . this value is set to 0 , the Dias@@ how long is repeated until they will change from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders right next to the input field . default is 1 .
click here the short@@ cuts for the different modes of modes &amp; h@@ ick@@ show ; in the box @-@ up @-@ commands for the display and short @-@ commands for the browser .
with this option you turn off between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the part @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short @-@ position .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short @-@ position .
displays lectures for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short @-@ position .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .

opens the input field for understanding . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; thick ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; make it as easy as possible error or possible improvements . this shows a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to post your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that is , that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , English speaking English , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to get involved in the show@@ photo ; it is the developer Mail@@ ing list . guidance to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to change as much control of your work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that access the behaviour of &amp; show@@ photo ; you have to adjust to these settings , you have to switch to these settings . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the sphere of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicators should be displayed in contrast . sub@@ ordin@@ ating should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions on the selected images . you can also display this page in the picture editing . you can display this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application for the scan of images that no longer power as images and p@@ ans .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan images , which is no more power to scan images or stor@@ ing . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; for each picture save a dialog to save and store the images immediately in a given folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner at the SAN@@ E project page by input the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or if no standard scanner was specified then a dialogue will be opened to the selection of the Sc@@ ann@@ ers .
the user can select the sc@@ ant scanner and click OK to open the scanner . breaking &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; quit .
the further settings contain more det@@ a@@ illed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) treats these options not particularly .
to obtain an image , the user can only start a screen@@ can and then scan scanning Range for the final scan . the preview is started by the preview button .
to select the picture better the user can enter the image and zo@@ oming out from the current selection . he can also adjust the Zoom so that the complete preview in the window fits .
if the image is chosen then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before the store is selected a preview in the settings is displayed , then the image is displayed in a window display as below , then the image is stored and scre@@ ens ? en leads to a break@@ down and you will get back into the main window .
with the button settings , the ep@@ onymous dialog will open before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture , if desired to view before the store . in this case the option required for stor@@ ing a preview display . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; photos saves up . dialogue to save for each image opens up the dialog in front of each inserted image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite , you want to store these automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must choose to ask for a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option of saving without after a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder is used as default for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatic photos and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets an numer@@ ical view@@ ix of each time that is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality for stor@@ ing images . this value also changes the comp@@ ression value when selecting the image quality is not selected , then the default value is being used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ manual . the button On laun@@ ches the KDE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; . the button Sett@@ ings displays the dialog for settings and shots can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ;

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . below you will find a list of this p@@ ump@@ tion and its function . the global short@@ cuts can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the glob@@ ulus required by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and choose short commands ...
you possibly can set existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . this makes your ke@@ yp@@ ad for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P &apos;s interface between Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general features that have mostly been found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists .
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command@@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command@@ line options .
you should give the user a review when the script should not be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are present and use different dialog , hence the user as@@ sign , why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Load@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE Bin@@ dings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder , full @-@ load you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as base for your own scripts , or simply extend the required functions . you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can be used with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included to each KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . usually , the function ex@@ ec is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively simply can be called : here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , shr@@ ubs should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it .
configure the script to preview the listing and loading of ordering data will take care of each script yourself . if a script is run , Amar@@ ok takes the labour folder on the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script may now be &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P features further information on the new piece ( for example , met@@ adata or pedi@@ gree ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ab@@ brevi@@ ated the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , if a user @-@ defined menu item is referred to . to add the script to the cli@@ ck@@ wise interface you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mov@@ e@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; stops , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed so for example the stor@@ ing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks &apos;s script can also install script packages , which have downloaded the user &amp; e.g. ; from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) comp@@ ressed . we recommend a archive name as z.@@ n@@ bsp ; B. stran@@ gen@@ pt@@ .@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok &apos;s script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Advanced application script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right properly .

the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can specify which screen should appear in a multi @-@ box monitor en@@ coded by the O@@ SD .
the map @-@ card Audio @-@ Edition lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable additional settings in this map .
the map collection will be used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that said &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . in order to refer to a folder in the collection with reference , highlight the an@@ to@@ box next to its name . this section also contains attach@@ fields to display , like with the selected folders .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ o@@ K requires only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ ver@@ b ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some features such as the O@@ SD decre@@ ases that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work properly , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example difficulties . we try Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the t@@ agli@@ b library . please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang down the broken file that causes the crash . then you can delete the file and let the collection again be created .
mostly , this is because the par@@ agli@@ der cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this bug to the t@@ agli@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try again SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something more mature .
make sure that all of the libraries were compiled using the same compiler @-@ version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x have been compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able you . switch off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically sent in a crash ) . if it is a frequent overthrow and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many program can write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but it is not listed as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; bug when writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random box / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the tool@@ tip is simply forgotten . this can be found in the Control Centre on Gray and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : resi@@ dual symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that Amar@@ o@@ ok will first find the right version first .
there are several ways . most installation problems are up ligh@@ test by the help of a experts of your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one mistake , if something is located on the troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting of a fault in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , only a blank play@@ list . how can there be music pieces there ?
this is easy . use the file navig@@ ator on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ window was converted into the web@@ stats window . you find it among extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : STARS stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to assess pieces must be displayed in the play@@ list for evaluation column . click on the top list of the play@@ list and select column show review . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works also when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press charge on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with your mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall , just as you would do it with other files . as simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , next to the Add @-@ button , the button play@@ list is located . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right button of the button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar at extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , therefore , is the real question of which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support you as pretty every only concei@@ vable audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even add text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be supplied in the default value no MP3 de@@ or . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , en@@ et@@ aste
start the Ya@@ que Online Update and install the &quot; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; playing MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the AL@@ SA @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a Mix@@ er device . a Mix@@ er allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and can be simultaneously accessed through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mixing ) . please take a look at the d@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this instruction should help you in search of the problem of a matter and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ ack ) .
that is doing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first de@@ code it . if you &apos;re looking for a fan or with little over@@ head . Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can spend straight to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound information sound &amp; multimedia sound system . activate sound@@ server with highest priority ( real time ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems associated with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause the disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . the magni@@ fier of sound @-@ pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts drivers , but instead , G@@ streaming or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for Analy@@ zer , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller der bu@@ ffer , the less agreements react to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but when I want to switch to the Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you have to register all the components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ stre@@ er FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask at IR@@ C -@@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g to compile and install it . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all the ff@@ m@@ pe@@ g files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; please report you below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org. if you have a full list of suggestions or wishes , please send it to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm to run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok runs before going to bed , then you will be arous@@ ed from the soft notes of the music that you stopped in front of bed .
how can we experience the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current tracks out when one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is available , you can proceed as follows . diesel command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user un@@ re@@ used Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Start windows on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in size changing windows .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button is a piece in the air @-@ row succ@@ ession in qu@@ eue . by pressing the input box after a search in the play@@ list , the first search results will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ ful functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can choose which browsers to appear .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K &apos;s MySQL support .
put the CD a , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . jump into the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired finish folder in a single @-@ section window . to automatically catch them files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ T@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SEL@@ ECT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; FRO@@ M &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Mim@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous review with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact has every single evaluation on the overall result .
you can enter the valu@@ ation for a piece by yourself by clicking on a sheet of an item in the play@@ list window . then you can select the valu@@ ation of a piece by clicking on the piece and edit : evaluation or F2 : you can edit the evaluation also in dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to give you that when you are to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have set a fixed open plan of the plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users may well find quite annoying . dis@@ able the option icon at the play anim@@ ate in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings to create boxes ... and take the desired changes .
download a design or create a custom . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation System allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . start con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sett@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu and select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add Amar@@ o@@ Properties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information that will be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ername and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please see the latest available versions . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore also causes a lot of troub@@ les@@ ho@@ es .
pres@@ um@@ ably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine this out@@ put@@ t module not compile . you need to configure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new con@@ figured and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules will still not appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution , which is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary development files . you now have to install the package g@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the mistake of the Stream@@ er Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with Pre@@ par@@ er , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you have to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without pre@@ amp . a tip of Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : Ver@@ wen@@ d@@ ne you do not compile a L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ streaming , has to be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad as well as the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you get the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ pe@@ g .
you play a MP3 stream from , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator G@@ ST @-@ register . then start Amar@@ ok again .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... audio output type the device one . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

the play@@ back window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of play@@ list , such as the context browser . the play@@ list is easy to use and nevertheless the play@@ list itself is powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adjusted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and inter@@ pre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained later in detail . they represent information on the ongoing pieces at each different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok , maybe you may have noticed that the sub@@ window will be off . the information presented there are now in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . besides , the information will be collected in the statistics window ( extras statistics ) .

if you want to search for entries , the spaces are included , then include the search term with ge@@ ese @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . thus , according to entries , the Mike Old@@ field will contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search expression , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for g@@ aps , which have higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece ( not included a certain search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for mos@@ quit@@ oes , which does not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ tax variations according to Bel@@ i@@ eben . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is searching for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or contain higher rating than 50 , and not included the comment .

&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface with the help of this interface can be controlled parts of the functionality for example via a shell scripts .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can use either the command line d@@ co@@ p , or use the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programmes are crucial in the functioning , therefore more your taste and the type of your requirements will be crucial , which of the print@@ out programs you give to .
in this chapter we take that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then give something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program reported , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two further parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions to test new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XXX@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : &quot; K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project can be obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . through this reference it is possible to change the project through K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only available on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :

with this , it is possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data @-@ project , several folders and then insert files into the new folder :

&amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; is the user interface from c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern ( comp@@ ression ) . currently , l@@ ame available for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( comp@@ uting packages ) will still have to be installed from Linux distribution . additional co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( free and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ressed into the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the lu@@ st@@ ine FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio sp@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer are already available , so it is very likely not necessary to compile some Linux distri@@ butions too . however , only the codi@@ fication packages are not used , the installation is also not required .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ fter Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of co@@ ar@@ er , audio quality and comp@@ ression factors .
a word on cop@@ ying of protected audio CD ; s : how already said , used &amp; c@@ audi@@ bility to cr@@ ack . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD @-@ device , it is not possible to avoid any cop@@ ier @-@ CD ; even if not the mechanism of cop@@ ying protection . simply avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ying protection . simply avoid the purchase of Cop@@ ier@@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once must be done ( the dialog dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard drive explains . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand for the slim approach of the user interface , about which you can frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ zer programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can be collected from the internet or can completely work without a network , whereby everything will manually be recorded .
this is only a brief list of commands of the main window . on the side step by step , you will find further information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request from the CD data accordingly to the establishment of request at the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . )
starts reading and - if a en@@ coder was con@@ figured in the Data tab in the installation folder - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , making the selection with a different en@@ coder than the default can be read . it is noted that previously the en@@ coder was con@@ figured in the dialog box settings in the dialog dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected for coding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and ex@@ pose .
opens the dialog dialog for the type of not@@ i@@ fications ( such as proto@@ col@@ s , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; ends ) .
opens the main dialog dialog by &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; with different card cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ co@@ ders ) . so far , you must go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and comp@@ ression @-@ rates and helps you to choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a lu@@ ous audio format required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low comp@@ ression rates and barely available commercial devices that can give these files .
among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ ression depending on their p@@ sycho@@ acou@@ st@@ ical model are MP3 and O@@ GG the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower Bit@@ ters ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but over this bit@@ rate , the differences are less important since both co@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality .
o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided with most distri@@ butions for free but there are open license issues
+ high up to very high tonn@@ s ( at high Bit@@ ters ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at low bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system , and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG Ab@@ duction is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as Standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car @-@ stereo installations . today - in the beginning of 2009 - these devices are mostly available only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting comp@@ ression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ Pres@@ et medium &apos; = This option brings good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ Pres@@ et standard &apos; = This option should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most musi@@ c@@ s. acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . need up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo , high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo , high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint Stereo , comp@@ ression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good gen@@ dered for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and car stere@@ os@@ ks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment .
&apos;@@ --@@ squee@@ zing Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or obtained through the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be handed over / used with &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; and the body &apos;s code to create the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programmes , there are often a combination of program settings for the codi@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help with codi@@ les explain the switches for these programmes .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s will be coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameter from &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences to be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ be@@ acon in assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can load the audio CDs , so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer . it is noted that here only text is spoken by : &amp; CD ; title , artist , behalf of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ry : that &apos;s the author , I can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so the artist can be inf@@ lic@@ ted by the artist or the music . all information can be obtained by a B@@ umm@@ el through a &amp; CD ; store , physically or virtual .
in &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; is active a cru@@ ising field ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eve the data from the server ( This may only be used only the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; for use of free@@ DB is set up , the geographic server needs to be used . this saves band@@ width in the network and balances the load between the b@@ ills .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of reflection on the online pick @-@ up of &amp; CD ; information on the read of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only to update the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that it is used to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who is always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see below is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed from suitable distribution first if this has not yet happened .
to Save the WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be chosen and thus the desired file format . on the first opening are the defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a free @-@ free comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the Data tab . other Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added at this tab .
the code @-@ package should be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined codes . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ der Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about his switches , by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check out the device design@@ ation recording of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk drives , the writing and read@@ y@@ cle of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs , f@@ lac &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; and this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this tips can give how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set out those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and read all our first &amp; CD ; read by MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) of 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . any suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , since it is not necessary to compile data files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own it ( eg ; by trying to copy with the con@@ quer@@ or something . )
the first section covers basic usage of &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; something which pres@@ um@@ ably be done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out@@ on &amp; CD ;
here we determine the use of Ko@@ di@@ erer to comp@@ ression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with , free@@ zing the free@@ DB to load the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it from any selection of a &amp; CD ; once the matching settings are found .
the device design@@ ation is delivered to the read@@ out program so it is able to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real de@@ vic@@ tor of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be specified , then a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment used for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map for General Sett@@ ings . here there is no much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything will be given so bel@@ low as in the screen photo .
only in case of un@@ complete information please choose , so that you are advised if information is missing for the test@@ er of keywords ( tags ) .
the map card CD ; settings . just choose both items . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected with the Internet during reading the &amp; CD ; so that he can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry now begins to read the reading of the &amp; CD ; and this is linked with low @-@ file name / fil@@ ename or a day @-@ file , they can easily be modified with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame as modified and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , further to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , you can start using free@@ DB locally in offline mode , if you want to use the database before . however , this is worth considering using free@@ DB in the Off@@ line mode , the two choices must be selected at least the first . the mode is set on the following map .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB @-@ server on the Internet . how do the system which data to get the CD is set ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything in the screen photo .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed among the b@@ ills . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function in@@ comparable what the server is concerned , as though a lot of fire@@ wall is the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first application field should de@@ activate .
simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
number simultaneously exten@@ sible pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel Reading and coding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply trying .
CD ; after reading the last song , you cross this to cast this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this folder , then the folder / folder can be stored , in which the WAV files are stored . it may not be useful when the files will be installed in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
everything as it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is something long , under certain circumstances , something must be broken down to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ squee@@ zing extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the result of this result is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and energy efficiency .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the creation of tags to Version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary , in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously looking at codi@@ fying WAV files : at a du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can try to ex@@ clude more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic establishment of &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; ends . this configuration is used as default for each out@@ reading of a &amp; CD ; if you chose the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , which is described in the previous section and is set up . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to pick up . the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each book@@ able &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD included , which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screens@@ photos show a little different from those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully issued by free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually input instead of taking them out of the Internet . comments will point out to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this sample s can be found . it is a &quot; special &quot; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet happened , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this is only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be read and by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia can be read .
if this does not happen , then ask in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD ; successfully managed by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces have already been filled out , and the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; indicates , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion the best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the cross @-@ field for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , but the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the document title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist should no longer be given in the input field &apos; Pres@@ ent title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the single comments ini@@ qu@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB is the CD @-@ Editor , but it &apos;s always a good idea to check the content of the CD Ed@@ itors . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to begin the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of fields on 30 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags , you have unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the tab lab@@ eling settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag from the generated files later with the day @-@ editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer to get more information .
just select an entry that is obviously agre@@ eable to the style of the original CD . in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway does not submit . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are available amongst rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Ed@@ itors will appear again and you &apos;ll see that the fields are already packed with the included data , which we recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . please enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to you all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed about the piece list .
note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of one piece . only the titles which are selected and select . a simple click on the line will select the selection of the piece , or you select the button all pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
has been started by clicking on the button selection read out the read@@ out process , this window appears to confirm . OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what proceeds .
click on the tab orders to turn on the order window . it is in the upper upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the bottom lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folder are not what we have entered in an example . have you checked whether you have any writing on the folder for the temporary files and the target groups ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the lecture given by the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new post : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . therefore , read out and ex@@ position parallel . take note of the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration adjustment to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous output and ex@@ ts ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is coded and a third order in the qu@@ eue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers is . after the last piece is coded , a small window will be built with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate comp@@ ressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the cook@@ er of your choice .
&amp; c@@ audi@@ ences ; CV@@ S is going to know from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions you can already download a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ ences ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ ac@@ ulate media from your distribution . if you &apos;re reading this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to people that compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs if it once runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many varieties of settings . best to read the step by setting the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different card maps of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still at the end ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked , without any reference point as it will go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially when at the time of program @-@ off@@ s do not find audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author can not sustain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to add or change , may it do . at least , after contact with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
strange if it succeeded to pick you up the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information yet , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; . beside others he has not have real @-@ time and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting from texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; supports also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ Proj@@ tt@@ ger , which is needed for the CIS cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as there is a sequ@@ encing .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the text text on the screen with altern@@ ating color , making it simple to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI @-@ channel on the high@@ lighting buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag into &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows on K@@ Mid .
supports the two available standards to store text in MIDI files ( Lie@@ der@@ events or tex@@ as@@ events ) . K@@ Mid automatically identi@@ fies the procedure used .
seating support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; quit the end of a song , the mid will start again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI @-@ synth@@ esi@@ zer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can Open ... from the menu item . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and add the button Ab@@ playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu piece or pray you the Spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; Start windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then re@@ played down . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and drive through the rain .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right the template speed . to get back the original pace , double click on the template LCD .
the Spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break like a pressure on the button break , or selecting the menu item a break in the menu , so taking the playing . if you play the Spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playing .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of tracks . some pieces are using Tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis , others use Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis and another both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the event type is automatically selected , allowing you to manually set anything manually . so if you have selected anything manually , then you have selected the kar@@ ao@@ ke text in the menu , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a event , select from the menu settings the entries file events or songs . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played in line . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collectors bear@@ ings . here you will find the menu collection under the point of Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the f@@ ake at the collector &apos;s match .
in the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection is not stored . you have to add that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected at the collectors &quot; ager . there , you can add a song with the kno@@ b button . it also appears in the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is added to the opening ( using file Open or drag &amp; drop ) automatically to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece , the temporary collection is activated and listed . this collection will then be added to the continuing pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you have to open the collectors bear@@ ings , select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series according to the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collectors bear@@ ings , or use the selection list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump to a song , choose the next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right .
to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry pre@@ dat@@ ory pieces from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collector button , choose the collection of del@@ eting collection and click on the button Clear .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not being saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synth@@ esi@@ zer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map General @-@ MIDI events in events that can understand the synth@@ esi@@ zer .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map , converting all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in Events of the Change File patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always leaves a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound@@ card GM -@@ compatible are ( incl . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END options ... END
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and END , that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the pat@@ ches of General MIDI can be assigned to your specific keyboard . general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM pat@@ ches lie in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard drives not a gun patch ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a Drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun tip . to this point you carry the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term &quot; Drum Patch of the patch , in which every sound is a different perc@@ ussi@@ onist ( Drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound means the tone @-@ height of the ever same drum ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds on a particular channel or instrument are illustrated .
as with PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their availability . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to form notes on the Per@@ k@@ isses channel . take a look at the provided key@@ maps .
this section can be used to create some channels to other . if you want to share the first and second channel , make it easy at CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a particular channel ( general MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ devices need@@ 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , built by following the pattern :
n it is the channel , which is depic@@ ted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map must naturally be defined forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this canal . in this case patch x is used as patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful for example to always use the per@@ plex@@ ing patch on the Per@@ k@@ tre@@ k channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates which ratio of pitch @-@ notification events are multip@@ lied with the value n , this is calculated with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed it only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to stand in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ komm@@ as ) .
this setting is needed because GM gives you that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch @-@ mail event with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone above . unfortunately , but trying some key@@ boards by two tones to play up to an oc@@ t@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ;
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under settings , item MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row keyboard ( one for every MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you can see what sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument to a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to preview the played sounds . view the view settings in the menu setting under the point of can@@ al@@ view : settings
the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is recorded . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while a mp3 @-@ file you need a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; with no A@@ we support was compiled . to remove the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s Home )
I &apos;d like to add an entire folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files individually .
agre@@ eing , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
activate earlier the setting of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can click the arrow @-@ button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD replacement to re@@ locate the play@@ back . to restore the default speed you can double click on the LCD double .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or I &apos;d like to play a file , just enter into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; drag the file and drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file quickly without giving them equal to a collection , turn the setting of automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection of added files .
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so , adjust the setting of automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then un@@ lock yourself , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid : was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; look ( Spain ) . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take me a bit of time . as Hob@@ bies I have sco@@ oter , MIDI files , music and phr@@ ases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me feel happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a pleasure for me to send me a postcard from your apartment or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ ao@@ ke file by a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want to send it to me ) . before you send a MIDI file , but you should contact me , as I already have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and was swe@@ pt by anybody for money . I therefore want to empha@@ size that I just get about program@@ mi@@ ere because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .

in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can watch the development , information and look at images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synth@@ esi@@ zer because the sound quality depends on your sound@@ card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an ax@@ we card .
if you have no sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card except that you can of course listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is used for playing video files of the M@@ players or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this host .
for additional help please check the page The KDE website to new versions or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to send the Favor@@ ite links under the menu book@@ marks but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are going to be played down , so you should use the category of play@@ list play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarchy of hierarchy . if you are entering an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the playing begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; up@@ light piece &apos; , television and durability play@@ list can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a category of a category cli@@ cked out of the menu view and displayed as next reference mode . by the cli@@ cking of a sub@@ group is displayed only the XML content of this part .
according to changing XML files , you have to choose the same with play@@ list from the menu or selected either the delivery mode , or another category will be selected .
all changes are lost if the mach@@ ining mode is left or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at Star@@ ten and Be@@ enden may be disabled by the edit of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ Player ; will be the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ i@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at Star@@ ck does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate through the opening of another source . this would be annoying at the end of the animation however , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the displaying of a favorite image ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g ; Start ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory test / some examples of sm@@ il that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here the path can be set off from the player and the mezzanine size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troub@@ les@@ ho@@ oting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this play@@ room in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be con@@ figured by manual mach@@ ining the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ful . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the module sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ z@@ illa ) :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can re @-@ play , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a utility vend@@ or for the MI@@ ME type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the dialog dialog , are specified by KDE labels .
the con@@ quer@@ or or kn@@ m@@ player ; is in a con@@ soles applying to search and browse after error messages related to loading the browser module library . if no error occurs , the che@@ ating issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
thus , a blu@@ ep@@ rint for a particular MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change@@ ment of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ ful c . for instance , phon@@ on can be rec@@ ated to all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ Players ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either using M@@ player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be con@@ figured , the scanner is used from the configur@@ ations dialog , or the configuration file may manually be edited .
for the Con@@ figuration of the V@@ DR ( Video data Rec@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is to use the dialog under - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be found ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB match .
since the V@@ DR may use support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video ( pres@@ um@@ ably this kind of play@@ ful of video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension required for the X server works . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , it is necessary to contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this d@@ vd@@ n@@ source , d@@ vd@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , commercial source , ur@@ p@@ ource , copyright source , source source , and source @-@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ list of the play@@ list .
are there evidence as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive le@@ iser , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is as user root according to incorpor@@ ating the device . it is absolutely sure to make sure / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must every time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ Players automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux operating system . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution and installation CD ; / DVD should be applied .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the k@@ ile .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual at ease . however , all suggestions for documentation should be considered . if support for this project or its documentation should be desired , the contact through the k@@ ile ; website should be made .

once the top @-@ code example has been typ@@ ed the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ code @-@ text will be compiled . the easiest way to do this is using the men@@ to or the bone loss .
the implementation must be saved from the comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for the storage is automatically saved .
slim the comp@@ ression of the document , should be sought in the log@@ ging of errors . if using quick@@ set , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started . if this is not the case , the proto@@ col@@ s should also be taken .
an environment ( c@@ f. environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest@@ ful document . for example , a report with the writing process is created and only a few rop@@ es are created . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } have equ@@ itable its Ã ¶ n@@ bing of the ty@@ pe@@ dest@@ Ã ¶ e within the surroundings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; &quot; &quot; ( en@@ f. HU@@ GE ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the changes are merely applied within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no circum@@ cis@@ ion ( number ) for imp@@ air@@ ment within one environment .
there are many possibilities for the read@@ ability of read@@ ability and usability of the document . it can be used for example certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , cur@@ si@@ veness , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either con@@ figured with the command \ \ , or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long g@@ low , until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after writing the source writing with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; display language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once in assist@@ ants a bit of text was typ@@ ed , a few adjustments to achieve the better read@@ ability of the document should be managed . here , you should get a quot@@ ation , a few places in li@@ pid and Cur@@ ves and a poem to apply to see the differences of this prec@@ ep@@ ts .
once the document has been viewed , an editor or C@@ tr@@ l can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) , with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try out and fun .
DVI ; is a det@@ ectable file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer monitors .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correctly adjusted ) .
the tool@@ bar attach the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ code version has been created , the conversion can be converted into f@@ eit other formats by means of chest strap .
the preliminary search results for the direct leap from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . this must be used only modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools b@@ auen .
in order to pick up the preference , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in one line of the source tex@@ tures and as@@ le@@ ep on pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer will then be done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; compatible and available to appropriate line . there must be defined &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( setting ey@@ epi@@ ece Set ... Editor )
should in the case of rapid construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewers do not Ã ¶ ff@@ nen , there may be a mistake . should an error occurred , this is displayed in the log file and in the message window .
the proto@@ col@@ s file ob@@ struc@@ tions the error source in the source code . in the editor , there are always the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the pres@@ et features are :
when selecting such document , a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . for more information on this topic are included in the section .
cro@@ pping users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be stored , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file contained or a new file is created . &amp; k@@ ile ; a new template can create a new template by means of a document of an existing document and selection from document templates ...
when creating a new document from a template using file new , some string chains are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can set up in settings K@@ ile ... Sett@@ ings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced .
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ ENT@@ AL $ $ : this string is replaced by entering in Docum@@ entation class . typically , they will be used as : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the att@@ acking of commands in the editor . once the document has been created to this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document then its own template is balanced rather than by default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . becomes a simple way for creating a template used , should be sear@@ ched for one in the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for the menu , can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
to learn more on Emer@@ ald &amp; Kate ; and its features would be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; have you been able to start reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for men@@ tioning La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all prec@@ ep@@ ts , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; usage can be found , as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with penet@@ rated Str@@ g -@@ button to adjust the &amp; tex ; -@@ words , that in this way is balanced by clicking \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p just \ \ par .
when pul@@ ling the text with a dr@@ illed mouse button , the full text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
if you use the arrow buttons with penet@@ rate Shift key , can be balanced parts of the source tex@@ tures in the monitor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; the features varied the most different types of source codes to search and to emphas@@ ise this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands of the normal text and also the mathem@@ atical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can make up the jumping mat in the text . the menu pop@@ up spr@@ ing@@ board or the appropriate key@@ chain can also be highlighted , so that it is also highlighted to the jumping side , so that it is automatically squee@@ zed during the first input of a sign .
working is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; various commands have been added , many environments and groups and therefore under@@ lined ; special commands may contain the following commands to contain the text @-@ selection :
w@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive matter in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the passing t are separated by two empty lines .
arous@@ ed the word under the current Cur@@ sor@@ position . this selection has also an extended meaning as this command is also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return risk ( \ \ ) and a vast@@ ly star ( * ) at the end .
to the len@@ schen of a part of the document can be removed from this first and by pressing the button de@@ f . &amp; Kate ; offers the touch panel C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire row is removed . under editing , the following commands may contain the length of the text :
re@@ moves a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of survey evalu@@ ations .
it has already been clar@@ ified that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for the other commands some work as well as simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command is sung to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the command to the remote location .
with this command will be sung to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is directly placed behind the command to the lie@@ ve of the environment .
if the cur@@ sor from or within the command \ \ begin { environment } is located to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many inter@@ tw@@ ined ambient commands may be quickly lost sight . this command includes the most recently mounting environment , so that the wast@@ ed ambient structure does not dis@@ integ@@ rates .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by br@@ ack@@ ets { ... } . under mach@@ ining Te@@ X group are a few important commands that suit the environment .
this command is sung to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps .
with this command is sung to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , is sung to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ rac@@ ed groups of br@@ ack@@ ets can be lost quickly the remote sight . this command includes the most recently printed group , so that the s@@ laugh@@ tered structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups not dis@@ integ@@ rates .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple initial translation is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character is used for two simple beginnings . also for the end of the initial mark , the character is &quot; used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and also includes two slept next sign for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic in@@ soles of the double initial mark can set under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X in@@ - and left @-@ out .
you can also include lÃ ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and thus German or French beginnings . there are also many other languages to be found .
when looking for Shift ; input paste and k@@ ile ; an intelligent f@@ uss wr@@ inkl@@ es . if the current position inside a lists -@@ environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is , for the current position inside a lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables environment are slept &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a as@@ hing en@@ closure off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to under@@ land . these can be added by settings k@@ ile ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X
some users want to arrange the columns in tables - environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) to as@@ sign up to each other . although this t@@ ulator is trying not of the corresponding tab@@ ulator , for the back @-@ hungry , for the columns , for the columns @-@ position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers a good source code completion , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to add special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) there are also three for need and the other two are for automatic understanding . all these modes can set up various working procedures under settings bo@@ ile ... susp@@ end .
when starting a new environment by using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when returning the return taste , the last character of the input will be removed and exac@@ ting , so the list can be reduced by entering another letter even smaller .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , descriptions are removed from &amp; k@@ ile ; also jumping brands , so that a simply jump to these positions means using mach@@ ined jumping brands N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est diving is possible and the best parameters can be inserted .
with settings k@@ ile ; set @-@ up ... k@@ ile ; comprehen@@ sible settings can be made for these lists . there can be different wi@@ res com@@ ings for tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as wound closure of the general voice available .
the command mode is for the comprehen@@ sion of environments not to land . it is always a few letter with \ \ begin , and the call of comprehen@@ sible mode will have a great list with ambient temperature . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for understanding the environments to create .
during the call of comprehen@@ sible processor , the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber Old + Shift key + Shift key , the command becomes un@@ folded of the environment automatically and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued by the sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pressing the input taste .
once this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists location , even a first \ \ item -@@ command is consolidated .
with settings k@@ ile ; set @-@ up ... k@@ ile ; comprehen@@ sible settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the winding result of the def@@ ect @-@ mode and tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; Main@@ ly custom lists of covers , which are instantly replaced by number of settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sion@@ ers set up . as an example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word comp@@ ressed the Men@@ Ã ¼ ber Str@@ g + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter L replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
Gro@@ Ã ¶ e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ more are not useful for automatic mer@@ gers . however , it was noted that many wound in a document has more than once written . thus offering &amp; k@@ ile ; the understanding has been written for all already written .
this mode can set up in the menu setting s@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ fully shi@@ fted . here also the Corpor@@ a value may be defined for viewing of understanding .
the most comp@@ ressed files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / mode / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian Home @-@ folder . mode is available for brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( Wide ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graphics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to include graphics as simple as possible . on the basis of view of the graphic formats , sections should be taken and respected . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to be able to watch the outcome of the work , it has to be compiled in the source text . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the volumes of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating collec@@ tively .
for the comp@@ elling of the source text for viewers , like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used by using old ; 3 , using old ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file is converted to a PS file and be viewed through old ; 5 the PS file .

should the working file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then they leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file using the other file file sel@@ ector .
type the name of the file , as the result is to be named , the file is usually stored in their home folder .
the plugins , the &amp; quantitative , have little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even perhaps little to do . thus , the plugin system will benefit instantly and must not wait until someone is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements that can be used . read more about it below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a package , we begin using the plug @-@ ins for plugins . this dialog will open :
this dialog allows , to manage all the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search box . when exec@@ uting plug @-@ ins without a storage place , and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the seeking of plug @-@ ins .
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be con@@ figured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project @-@ Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look out from the list of te@@ amm@@ ers who he is . this happens when he is searching the team member from the list and replace the button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears after which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on notes .
beside the overview of their team , there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team : the event can be created an event to inform the team leader when something happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific to the project happens . an example would be how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into the CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc .
on the event &apos;s event @-@ configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings , and events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the recipi@@ ents selected at the recipient list . the address can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , such leaders will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
submit comments is simple . it can be selected either the note -@@ entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box , followed by cont@@ act@@ ment text .
notes may be sent to a determining member of the team . in this case , the syn@@ tax is the name of the team name ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader , sub@@ project leader should be introduced in the relevant area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roll names are independent of large or small prescription , but spaces around the br@@ ack@@ ets and the : make the note inv@@ ali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages , which is D@@ TD fi@@ du@@ ally and web@@ based form @-@ based and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a brief description for others can be found in .
the settings may be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . Dies@@ er@@ Dialog extends over several pages that are treated in succ@@ ession .
the behavior of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car insur@@ rec@@ ation can thus be changed .
large / small @-@ scale of tags : big / small prescription of automatically added tags . normal wholes@@ ale / mini@@ ature means , the tags are to be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / small @-@ scale of attributes : big / low @-@ prescription of automatically added attri@@ bute . normal wholes@@ ome / mini@@ ature means , the attributes are inserted just as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; enclosed .
un@@ optional tags automatically close : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish tag automatically update : when swit@@ ched on , the corresponding tag will be with@@ drawn and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs into appropriate coding during dispos@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by means of the default standard the standard specifications can be restored .
standard @-@ coding coding : coding from newly created or in other ways than using file op@@ ener files ( where the coding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed ) , however , this setting will be loaded by the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not detected , but this setting will be loaded from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regular backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or overthrow in the next start of the program the document may be recovered from this backup . it is not the same as saving the file . even for yet not stored documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the time you created .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or in one &apos;s own opinion ( or the documentation in a box ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
replace the window settings on the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface by changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mod@@ i and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views on each other . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line .
the warning @-@ breaking area serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the display of war@@ nings by no longer inquiries .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation process of the V@@ PL@@ - and the code view in line mode . in terms of different modes .
here is the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the illustration of the Par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , in detail .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the rede@@ em@@ plate by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree settings , the visibility of k@@ not in the tree can be opened automatically and how deep within a change of structural tree can be opened automatically . clean knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , whereas the empty spaces are not found in the current document .
the area for the determination of ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded to editing of large contents . ab@@ brevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . this means , it can provide a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause exemp@@ tion is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are spro@@ uting @-@ applications from third @-@ site , which can be re@@ used by any other @-@ part application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified :
address : the path to plug @-@ in if it is not on a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be transferred to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folders .
component in &quot; Only &quot; read &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied boarding . only @-@ read @-@ kits usually refuse the store , if this option is not chosen .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the specified information is correct . pick the storage system if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the error was completely renewed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept was implemented , the various Imple@@ ment@@ ations about plug @-@ ins allow .
currently only a plugin available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options besides the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings may be changed .
if for a project a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view that is displayed in the contents of covered variables . usually , appears in the left dock .
a view , in which all shelf points , are listed with number@@ ed num@@ mern and conditions . usually , appears in the lower dock .
a view , in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually , appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ation . this action is caused by default when a project is opened , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is not necessary , so that in the normal case it does not have to be respected .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the leaf according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initi@@ ate a debug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the view of Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
displays the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , and the current line @-@ up specified line continuously . if this happens , while the script is raised , the execution carried on . happens before a debit request was started , the script starts with the request .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information about over@@ watch@@ ful variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is app@@ ended , the execution continues . happens before a debit request begins , the execution starts as soon as a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement on the script , without entering the functions or decre@@ ases .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement on the script , and if possible in functions and includes faul@@ t@@ less .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the directive and go to the next as if there is the current not .
opens a dialog , where a variable or expression can be inserted , the super@@ vised value appears in the variation view .
this dialog can be issued a variable or a new value of variable variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to suit your needs and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; helping them get better .
documentary type Ed@@ iti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car comprehen@@ sible and non @-@ need@@ ing ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s there are two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script folder and the tool@@ bar . day folder includes two file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML @-@ files with the extension .@@ tag@@ ged window ) , the text and instructions faster to insert in a document than a user could ever be .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create t@@ XML files then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
meeting files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attri@@ bute for tags as well as the layout and content of the original shared catalogue ; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bar allows quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without any danger of any typ@@ ist .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the files des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ bing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 @-@ related )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better overview and more information on the work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders are presented in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type above itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the subject class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only available for the type of method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ able group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; text &gt; -@@ day . this is a single element type element .
describes an attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attri@@ bute . additionally it contains the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally it contains other tags , descri@@ bing how this attri@@ bute should be displayed , etc . this is a single element type element .
returns the source used for bot@@ t@@ ling source texts for the attributes in the day @-@ Ed@@ itor@@ dialog , and in the attri@@ bute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; will be used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a stroke and a methodology . the arguments to be handed over to the method . can be empty or % day name , that means the name of current tags .
a tank @-@ tag group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can occur for one attri@@ but@@ able description only once . it is a only element type item .
sets the position of the attri@@ but@@ able of a tags inside a dialog box . this day can happen for any attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; col@@ abel &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
prints a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this item is a single element type .
prints a list of elements that end a day . this item is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML @-@ file : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be cool@@ ed and closed .
blan@@ ks affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; amp ; characters . these should be done by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; be replaced . this will cause no cur@@ ri@@ mental effect , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools Make dialog up in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start window and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place in the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ Element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ sch@@ ema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ portable Type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is just as simple and there is an editor accessible via D@@ TD Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ TD settings . this can be di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c : should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nickname = The simpli@@ fied name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
an action can set up action with settings . click on New action to the same dialogue :
this can be assigned to this action . by clicking the button user , a short@@ cuts may be assigned ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ cuts removed .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current C@@ ursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick@@ start @-@ dialogue or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
the first thing should be the name of the script and interpre@@ ter . for example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified p@@ ade allows , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting variation in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / p / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special vari@@ able that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file : / from the document name .
% pid : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if run by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is applied to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods can be a script required from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the default input . in the optional entry you may be determined what to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected Text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % of the variable is usually useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the performed application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , to which standard default sti@@ pul@@ ations . it can be specified by which the text should be done to the default version , by adding value the selection issue is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to accommodate the tags in logical groups . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add action and configure . select Sett@@ ings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts to start working mode .
complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes have and you intend to use their use , activate a dialog &quot; day &quot; to call , if available , so that a input in the Promotion will be possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we got difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; select other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose editing size another .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green , usually as useless , sti@@ ff , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; Start one day in the current document .
upon the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this will take place via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box there is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the apply button and continue it with other tags , so there are still what there or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplement functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared this to a better overview through some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialogue about settings of the tool@@ bar . make sure the tool@@ bar desired .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( on the left side ) for my work product . after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to get a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my work @-@ equal , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button is .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested through pro@@ b@@ ieren of all symbols to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be im@@ plant folder , but your tool@@ bar should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( n ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type .
maybe the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; add to the normal user is the opportunity to like documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create one &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; check the Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you have to search an existing documentation for the formats / script / etc . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we have to leave the first part we treat you here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ version 1 = func@@ ter 2 = func@@ 1 , tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP , documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 . PHP 3.0 &#93; , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .ht@@ ml ... Language Reference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .ht@@ ml ...
pay attention to the # and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for chess tel@@ eph@@ ones ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash , but try it yourself .
you notice that the content directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the top of the construction of construction &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
blan@@ ks affect nothing , but watch out and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ eries are replaced .
the table section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended to display in context sensitive to context . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script running the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array _ function , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the cont@@ ext@@ list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ linking .
a simple list of co @-@ defined context elements which are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and worth are shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the comp@@ art@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places we will send an e @-@ mail menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in templates , and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users will be checking and only available when our team needs them as accurate and beneficial for publication . to make a useful contribution , we recommend using resources to be a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources will be guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
by up@@ loading , you are asked for their special G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to find out . in the dialogue New resource needs to be completed ( URL preview can be empty ) and by clicking on OK the up@@ loading .
the upload can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in Tem@@ plate and scripts .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigated &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it may be taken into consideration . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is possible to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . it gives the sim@@ pl@@ est way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that should be used . afterwards the following dialog :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ ition@@ s@@ zeile : the string , die im ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d may appear
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to take full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , one has to bring to them precisely these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit to them .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; utili@@ zes , available . from materials such as global indicates , stored in the joint folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; . this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different materials , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web@@ developers for a single user . they are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a certain project . this can be all done by &amp; CSS ; methods up to tool@@ bar with special actions , especially for the files of a particular project . simply stated , this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns from all staff within the project .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the screen window , the construction insight , the cardboard , with info and the tool@@ bar . please propose and for further information about these fields .
you can click the map with the right mouse button to get a cont@@ end menu with the current document immediately , such as close the current , other or all cardboard , re@@ loading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click menu in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the edited Docum@@ entation , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , processing of under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or aper@@ ture the file , if the string under the mouse @-@ line is called a file .
at the top of the editors are the tool@@ bar . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Trans@@ itional can be shown as default , for which a set of tool@@ bar will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , such as &amp; lt ; then click the symbol which represents the tag on . well , you can insert the data for this just added day . if you wish to insert the data for this just added day , you should insert a day that has multiple attri@@ bute ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog separate fields .
the buil@@ ders ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them and en@@ roll@@ ers . in the presentation with cart@@ els are available for files , project , pattern , scripts , scripts , scripts and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative concept . this view displays all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project through right mouse click . actions such as add , removal , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the right @-@ click menu .
another way of VER@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what purpose they are used . the category depends on the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working area . global Templ@@ ates are always available , local codes only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right button , you can access the available information about a script , such as the script should start , edit or send your mail .
with this view , one indicates the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking on the element &apos;s position , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking a elementary propos@@ itions it opens a list of commands with regard to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other construction views . with it , man@@ if@@ ying attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces may change the change of all available attributes with few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development to find . it can be previ@@ ew@@ ed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added , edited and looked at .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes at the bottom of the window , can be reached on the beneficial information : the message window and the problem window .
this map reveals information about each in the Qu@@ anta &apos;s current script . thus , for example , the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes available to D@@ TD .
this map reveals all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there is ) in this window .
the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bar are being extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the tool@@ bar side of the tool@@ bar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as comp@@ ression T@@ ar @-@ archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an E@@ Mail , they can secure it in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you want to adjust the files to your system . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . options are easy to understand and here not executed .
if you have trouble downloading &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 I folder . also you should ensure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE @-@ surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a swift web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; the editor began to create the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stub@@ born Mark@@ up languages would go ? well , this would make him an absolutely great@@ ness web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confin@@ ed to pure and HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE should be ; for that .
well , to the above mentioned claim must be noted , that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developers , which has already developed anyone else ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ aff@@ old is not only this possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables Web@@ Develop@@ ers to increase productivity with a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program comp@@ lements it is possible to remember the program of comp@@ elling them &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand without getting to remember a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more information about it in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast design development and quickly expanded to an enhanced editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers made the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more into the details of the documentation is with help : / quantitative ( either this URL to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; input , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative a run ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ encer @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the paragraph about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project file folder , only one error is reported .
convert at paste from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special character to the &amp; HTML ; - Pres@@ cription , allowing them to be displayed correctly and not by the browser as a form@@ att@@ ing guide .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; which is the correct way to paste special characters and blan@@ ks in &amp; URL ; s . first , foremost to paste &amp; URL ; s in the an@@ chor @-@ day .
divi@@ des the block@@ selection to or out . this allows you to select text blocks using the help of the &amp; Shift .
move directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
looks a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window up or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
curing and turn of the problem regul@@ ator at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem sol@@ porter will be activated once you change to the structural tree .
displays the symbol@@ ism left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are reading characters in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or nights , depending on the position of the C@@ urs@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file turn .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to paste files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
sear@@ ched the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows , e.g. graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more on / output emo@@ unt ( KI@@ O Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be explained by the details .
loads of the project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project @-@ box / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or Project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings actions ... or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to store the tool@@ bar .
removed a tool@@ bar from the point of view . that del@@ etes they not from the disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that .
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar in the next release is present ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows up@@ loading of materials on the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anything else has done and convert into that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / auff@@ eur of the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; . is useful when the ab@@ norm@@ alities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without renew the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and is not present a b@@ undle in the global KDE folder , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar , there is in tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day dialog dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the smart head of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the items listed below . click on . click on an active plug @-@ in disabled .
chose the syn@@ tax@@ ing mode for the current file . the list of available lighting schem@@ ata depends on the f@@ ates ; -@@ version ab .
choosing the type of tick @-@ identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people , use other OS platforms to wrap . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; load by means of external application .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . through some restrictions in the KDE libraries can cause changing times or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the cardboard box , which is also default , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the display in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and sooner .
in addition , this menu provides for each open sub@@ window to an entry . with a selection of an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated .
swit@@ ched the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window g@@ sters , or out .
the changes in this dialogue include any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
targets the behavior of the Ed@@ it@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; Kate , one finds details .
a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which can change the sequ@@ ences .
this should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project by filling the entire directory @-@ structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project characteristics .
here is the name for the project to give , for example foo . when entering the name file is automatically filled out .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , she has saved the name of the project in small case and with no space with enlargement web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine , which you want to access , except you may use local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets you be empty this field , the standard settings of the selected proto@@ col@@ s may be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adaptation might be necessary .
that is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default net@@ bars . if a joint collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you have static web@@ content you want to download and change . with server @-@ page scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
compact en@@ act when files that are located somewhere in the main folders from the project . if a project is newly started again , not an@@ h@@ aken .
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder , and you can make a precise selection of your li@@ king .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ hook or , by removal of the ho@@ oks , cl@@ ing out of the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings may be up@@ loaded in the menu with Project @-@ Properties in the box window profiles in the basement window , or with the key Shift ; F@@ 7 Shift .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional items will be explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which can be re@@ classified in project @-@ related operations like Project ord@@ ner .
comple@@ mentary option to top , even files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read .
this can be selected by the required de@@ bu@@ gger . at present , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set with the button options . in case the error is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles up@@ loading up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) be set , as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing an own construction view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window configuration , project members can be added , edit or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the window configuration configuration , one can insert action @-@ actions and add these actions , edit or delete . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see into the details .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior can currently not affect .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be automatically stored . you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you load a new project .
the project @-@ view @-@ view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files in the current project can be managed .
folders behaviour also , however , are missing the entries opening and opening with ... in the right button of access to the right button :
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of upload files . see .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button is canc@@ eled to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the energy storage and forget for programming . this option is useful when choosing files needed and the more un@@ secure password on the plate is not saved into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog until you change your mind from the up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many up@@ loading profiles can be compiled and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) are up@@ loaded to various servers . when working or creating a profile will be shown on this dialog :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied , either a fully qualified dom@@ ain@@ name or IP address .
the Trans@@ fer@@ protocol for the high load . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and installed KI@@ O Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not conduct a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it can not be easily read , but everyone can see with programming conditions , it can easily be seen in the plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be in a project many views , i.e. by simply tick the view , various files and materials can be loaded and replace the current open files and tool@@ bar .
views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible or deleted from the tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with whom to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to his own way of working .
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best covers the tool@@ bar menu . usage and execution differ . the addition of tool@@ bar is handled at the bottom in the section of the tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and symbols may be set to remove a new tool@@ bar with new action ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , and can remove other promotions as a tool@@ bar , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action have been edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of tool@@ bar ... and settings actions can be set .
Templ@@ ates are essentially docum@@ ent@@ ative , code sc@@ lets and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a common file system with expan@@ sive organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each at the system existing directory in the deposits . Templ@@ ates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template carried out carefully before using .
bin@@ ary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary styles are usually included in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in preference under global templates . further information on templates tree is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special sc@@ aff@@ old documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . it makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ old for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . some examples can be found in preference under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted based on a template , but the same text area is again inserted in the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in preference under global templates . see for more information on templates tree .
as the name says , serve these templates for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure , together in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
create a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as a template save as a local template ...
once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look in the pre @-@ storage room under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Now as a template to save the selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the choice can simply be drawn with pul@@ ling and jun@@ ctions to the construction of the template .
the creation of bin@@ ary templates is simple : copy the file into a file folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pul@@ ling and distribut@@ ing , or inser@@ ting about the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
one can click in the file tree or in the project files of window man@@ power to a folder on the right and secure site template , a name for the template and backup . by default in the project folder , but of course , it can be saved as local or a global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented preview . you can insert head@@ lines and pe@@ ers or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can insert some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the sub@@ structure structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / text / quantitative and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantitative a / vend@@ or . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of tank , as explained above .
to determine the behavior of a folder , in order to click with the right mouse button , click on the folder and select in the context menu characteristics . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or Templ@@ ates . this selection is canc@@ eled as soon as el@@ ter@@ ous attributes have been planted .
this is by default and fit for everything except the stem folders in the pre @-@ page overview . if a stem ord@@ ner would generally dis@@ abling , unless they are explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text construction . if nothing appears , one is probably in a trunk .
permits previous or put text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or feet for all templates for a specific project and enables cop@@ ying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / track @-@ lines a whole presentation already using the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , you have the right @-@ click menu ( show the right mouse button ) on a full command collection for the addition of folders or copy and insert from templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; HTML @-@ Editor , which are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor through the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the Z@@ ATION divide the editing window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit it and when needed for the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; in order to edit &amp; PHP ; furthermore , the source code is necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time , the modifications are visible in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously enabled , this mode is already active , the key@@ press lists the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ isation process between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta ; -@@ view can be adjusted between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in the selection , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation applies : a small margin for quick machine and a large span@@ ish for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the title of the website , so the processing of un@@ visible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be created . it serves the decre@@ asing of the final code . thus , you can change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags meet the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ items can be added below or removed by pressures of the contents , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ note 2 on the page column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way of designing the look of pages on the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list . a change on the list is possible as with the met@@ a @-@ elements . editing CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style sub@@ folder by selecting the file @-@ opening button and choose the corresponding file .
the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is as described in a text processing , by referring to the arrows , possible . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and cle@@ ared by means of de@@ pressing or removal .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . it is to note that the inser@@ ting of tags previously mentioned already existing ones tags , e.g. if an an@@ chor @-@ day , is inserted with text , everyone has to re@@ moves the surrounding an@@ chor @-@ day .
some tool@@ bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will later be installed in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bar must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of breast@@ feeding . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of breast@@ copy can be prosec@@ uted .

there are many graphical tools to the compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ory many changes made and simultaneously in many places the classification have been corrected ; another programmer had altered much text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts at the same time .
the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps just the re @-@ change had changed . that &apos;s how this changes occurred a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; it could represent differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , a lot more useful functions were added .
if you want to compare quick text for example , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons , and contrac@@ ted by folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; nearly to a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ ways together are fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of each other on a piece of co@@ sting and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps solve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result expected outcome . in this editor you can even edit the result even directly . the screens@@ hot displays three Qu@@ ell files combined :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with compar@@ isons and merge complete folders . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; execute the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and pres@@ cri@@ es the possibilities of hypo@@ cr@@ itic . if you have often check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and sp@@ ul@@ si@@ fiers are shown visible . if the lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see a look at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no hass@@ le more when someone and the reverse is changing . )
if a file is the same , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red colour means that both differ files .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make your typ@@ ing work only by writing the file name from the first file . example :
Alber@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 folder
the opening @-@ dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames when selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the open list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons is selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if together , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to set a output file . you can do this step later by the stor@@ ing .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialogue with settings . here you can set options before you start with the compar@@ isons .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text compare . the comparison starts then immediately . in the opening @-@ dialog you need to select no files you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use pul@@ ling and distribut@@ ing : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar features . if you like to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would have to load just two corresponding files , they into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , insert and then compare .
note : currently you are not able to draw anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; just draw . only the falling apart from text into a compar@@ ative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret and insert text into another program as trigger and inser@@ ting ( instead of cop@@ ying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the information line contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ( if the path is to a file long , leave the mouse a while over the line . then a small utility window will show the full name . )
the three sources are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the pres@@ et color is Red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( together ) .
links next to the text is the association column . if differences were found , the color indicates the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.@@ g , white signs is relevant only in character and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line , which points the summar@@ izing column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the particular source file has no lines . if the column is enabled , the line is dot@@ ted on the line lines .
the result page ( under the compar@@ ative stars ) also has an info line with the wording issue : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; when you have dealt with the result . usually , it includes the automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dis@@ solved , the stor@@ ing is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to the stem solved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative stars be used , each contrast can also be resolved at the same time a conflict which must be manually solved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group &apos;s group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows , where the group would otherwise dis@@ agree with the color background color for the current range and on the left appears a black beams .
sometimes , through auto mer@@ ging or by manual mach@@ ining no more line will be left in the group ; then it is only a space for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again select a different source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ ings that you might copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; assem@@ bling concerts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result list . go carefully with this feature .
note : if you select the sources the options do not ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments may also be treated like white signs .
this navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll @-@ runs and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the window , you can use the arrow buttons right , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w how you can also use it by other programs . the over@@ look column next to the vertical picture bar can be used by clicking on the N@@ avi@@ gieren Sie .
in the Aug@@ ef@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons for working . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ tion and trans@@ cription mode . ( pres@@ et is the inser@@ tion mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as mentioned in the section and explains the ed@@ itable output file ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / advance difference ( C@@ tr@@ l below / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / un@@ solved conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , must be distinguished between sol@@ dered and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ ings in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this option is automatically deleted , whatever you mark , automatically entered into the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual Cop@@ y disk . be careful with this option but carefully as you could not re@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a f@@ uss @-@ sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use w@@ agen@@ übersicht + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ sch@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ user does not keep track of the source files so that &apos;s why you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the recently used files will be automatically saved , and will be restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue also displays scripts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in recur@@ sive script are represented . if the chosen script does not support this representation does not happen at all .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be represented later . on these systems the button pres@@ ets will automatically create an un@@ modified color .
when this option is enabled , the pressures of the tab@@ ulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator is inserted .
if you press the input or return , the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically copy to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board expi@@ res then .
you can choose which type type you prefer to save . the vo@@ icing value is the generally common selection of the used operating system .
while compar@@ ing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step allows white signs to be ignored . the second step is not ignored each line . in this step white signs will not be ignored . also in the white signs , white signs will not be ignored .
some Ed@@ it@@ oren ( on some systems ) save a car sign &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then they could be activated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , but then they could be activated with different sizes on the side @-@ side comparison , however like a white character . during which , this option must be de@@ activated . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
in preference , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in preference , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensi@@ vely searching for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effectively with complicated and large files , but slowly with very big files .
in the automatic transmission mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will be proce@@ eded .
solve automatically all conflicts in white character by using the chosen file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files need to be less important . if you only use this from time to time , then use the automatic choice also conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ignor@@ ance C / C + + -@@ Com@@ ments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on Scan@@ nen von folders and lead to a merger . look for details under the documentation for directory comparison and con@@ duction .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ alled . if already a such back@@ up@@ file is app@@ ended with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ulator , this will be deleted without further backup .
adapting the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program . you need to stop and rest@@ art that the change will be active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set up globally via the control center ) .
the following codes can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the above setting will be used for all entries .
over the selection fields for coding a brief reference , which is a brief reference , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
adjust the file code for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpret . as coding for each file is adjustable individually , even files can be compared and combined with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding for stor@@ ing should be used .
if you define the processing command , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can set the coding of the output of pre@@ p command folders .
turn this off to press the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options do not ignore or Ig@@ nor@@ iere C / C + + -@@ Com@@ ments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are shown . however , sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is shown next to the normal nor a second over@@ lap column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . you can easily use the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the compar@@ ative side by side or side to each other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . a simple click starts the merger and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as vo@@ icing names for output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot that , then the name of the most recently used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file , it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that meets the exact requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out @-@ out parts or to correct the setup .
when reading a file , it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the instruction will be given only at the line @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your own CPU , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line has to have an associated output line .
the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is however , that in most cases cur@@ sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ amp command for loading in large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . * is a erg@@ ative expression of the text displayed on each string and in this connection , the \ \ 1 is based on each string text . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other Ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some keywords within the same pattern of $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you might even think that regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ us@@ e.@@ sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 6@@ 78@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; any sign between &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing but almost er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several deposits at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l @-@ . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ p &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Re@@ placement / switches &apos; allergi@@ es are required at per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for viewing and related . the further operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ bi @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m appears .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the prec@@ essor commands are very useful , but as with any feature , the text is altered or differences , you may fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , programmers are going to edit in a folder a lot of files . for this reason you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and combined .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the sim@@ ulate and shows the simul@@ ated changes without it truly perform ,
... selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 button ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) ,
this is the compar@@ ative and comp@@ uting of individual files to be very similar . you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog .
if three Fol@@ der will be assembled , folder 1 is used as base . if no target file was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as target @-@ folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start working together , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform a small message window on the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared to that .
when the scan@@ tool is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and each folder in the scan was found , is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking on the arrows icon all sub@@ directories from sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories that you can fold or cl@@ ap all sub@@ directories .
when you double click on a file , the file size will be started and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the icon in the column Name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the fil@@ at@@ ype is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the connections will not be selected automatically . if this will run together , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as seen in the above image , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , the colour is also identical , although the age of the items is different .
folders are considered as identical if your whole content is identical . then , the folder also have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant to its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y that is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A , B and C not have the same data type ( for example , if a folder and B file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started together .
... A and B do not have the same data type ( for example , if a folder and B file ) : error : contradic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started together .
the mode to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze is active if only two folders and no explicit target were specified and if the option directories are syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action in order to make the both folder identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ ename for the output file only B ; directly after the composite , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folder will be combined and select the new file instead of going on ( uns@@ afe ) then exam@@ ining &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the exact date is identical ... files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the file cannot be started together .
while co@@ operating , one file will be processed after the other . you state @-@ column signi@@ fies if the result was successful , and accordingly other messages , if something dis@@ nex@@ p@@ ected . if that &apos;s come together , you should check a final review and see if the status is all right .
if in the dialog dialog , the file method is selected , K@@ .COM is displayed more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only appear when three folders compared or combined . )
you can either have the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries have selected at once . if you have selected all the one @-@ clock actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) you can perform that together .
please note : if you do not have a Target folder , then in the three folder mode , C as a destination is used , with a two @-@ folder , B as a destination is chosen and synchron@@ ise the A and / or B as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries will be displayed in the target structure , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to be covered by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises :
to make all the entries together : select directories / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard ) . in order to make the current entry / select action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if due to contradic@@ tory data types still exist inv@@ ali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , will appear a comb@@ ative window with the options circul@@ ating , sim@@ ulate and ab@@ ort .
select simulation , if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes you &apos;ll get . you will receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual intru@@ sion is necessary ( comp@@ uting a single file ) , then you will open an open window ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again directories , or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue will be . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continued work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; click on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll be able to try out the cause of the problem . if you choose to re@@ locate the cause of the problem , or to ski@@ p the problem of the problem . thus , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue to merge with .
if some entries have been individually assembled , notes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these items ( in the current session ) and leads them later related to all entries . even if this has been related or not recorded , these entries will be considered settled . only if you change the merge promotion , these entries will again be mer@@ ged .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Def@@ 3 set ... ) now has a section called directory interaction with these options :
only files fit to the specified pattern will appear in the elementary tree . there are multiple pattern to be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . folder you must not correspond to that pattern .
files and folders correspond to that pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to that pattern , are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ atic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file can be set . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ esystem files , files have a default attri@@ bute . a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary file or not . this option is enabled in default .
if left on files : if the option is swit@@ ched , symbolic short@@ cuts are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
if the option is swit@@ ched , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is swit@@ ched , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively per@@ ately . ( note that a link to a folder of a link on itself would result in a power loop and refuse off . ) This option is not swit@@ ched in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and essentially s@@ lower if they are applied to files that does not contain any text ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
when you compare large folder via a slow network , it may be faster , only the amend@@ ment date and file size . however , this speed requires a degree of security . please use caution . this option is displayed in default .
similarly as confidential to the amend@@ ment date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if when cop@@ ying the amend@@ ment date . please use caution . this option is displayed in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ise mode when two folders are compared and no target section are specified . in this mode , the suggestions are made to the assem@@ ble . also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is placed in default .
if there are differences , the cop@@ ying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered as uncertain as it is provided that the other file is not also changed . you should consider this in any case . ) This option is placed in default .
when a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .or@@ c extension already exists , then this will also process the normal assem@@ bling of individual files , not only the associated whole file . this option is enabled in the default .
usually , the folder &apos;s di@@ version stays visible ; you can move the window p@@ one with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window in the window -@@ menu and switch between directory &amp; text windows between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , you can create a single file directly , without the folder you launch , the status will be completed on finished and the file will not be brought together once you launch the folder .
this status is however lost if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : new read
KDE supports network transpar@@ enz with the help of KI@@ O @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ user uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a ftp @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder in a comp@@ ressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax as local files and folders . some things should be observed :
a path can be relative . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Leer@@ es &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then , one file will be accepted as a link objective . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no way to edit author@@ ization or modification date . therefore , the author@@ ization or modification date from original . ( note the option confidential of size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main reference purpose is currently known as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . by means of K@@ Z@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewers , and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part , dating back to the context menu .
usually , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as the default file , taking a patch file in Uni@@ fied format . then ent@@ ails &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the con@@ quer@@ or you can select on a patch @-@ file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ user . please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable when the original files since the patch of the patch .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the same or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the module mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist es Komp@@ are ) there is already . besides , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can be combined like the program diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs very long and have learned a lot by running into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or go to this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and are not communicated to the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default case , configure / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the README file you will find more information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are considered as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical to each other , if similar lines are the next to each other , this may be , but this is the case .
the editor keeps for every difference in the files he begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , which could save this information .
the effort for this has been too large until now . you can restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src lin@@ ts ; released and the text cannot be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to distinguish from differences . even more blood@@ ho@@ oting would be conf@@ using and lack the purpose . do not use any other editor .
many good ideas and troub@@ les@@ ho@@ res came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of latest changes can be found under ht@@ tp : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the README file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or reverse @-@ removal ) copies the marked text . paste ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Exten@@ sions ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current Cur@@ sor@@ position or replacing the current mark@@ ings .
only differences appear : files all identical in all folders appear not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you must read following changes to these options the folder with the function Ref@@ res@@ h . )
it will only appear to display the differences . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain , they are likely to have changed after that . ( the behaviour will be cancelled later in a later program version ) This option is not swit@@ ched in the default size .
note the buttons to choose the source with the sign@@ board A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are app@@ ended from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result pages ( if the lines are already present , they will be re@@ located at the button accordingly .
in preference , this option is de@@ activated . the differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) will be treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the desktop surfaces , to change their size , to finish them or to post@@ p@@ one it . this works both inside a desktop and at several times .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display all virtual des@@ k@@ tops as well as those running on current applications . applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , then click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context of the application and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize space and ending . the commands make the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only if you cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only if you click on an application .
is this attrac@@ ting field marked , you can move window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , the names of virtual des@@ k@@ tops are displayed .
to cross this field passes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is indicated with the name indicated , the names with or@@ din@@ ers will provide , and eg ; 1st working space .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the ongoing programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . a symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and Pix@@ map . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; controls are determined : classi@@ cally @-@ known as from p@@ ager applications in some other Win@@ dow@@ s@@ s ; wa@@ agre@@ es shows all virtual des@@ k@@ tops in a wa@@ ist and vertical in a vertical series on what is very good for viewing on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right click on the right button of mouse button , and then select the switch between switch ... lets the dialog adjustments appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ . if you do not want to register as a user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you need to register the key win@@ dow@@ ed fashion and as@@ sign it to this a value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ likes ; it is a screens@@ hot . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag . this application is interesting for different users . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual imp@@ ending . this documentation should be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance b@@ ills .
if you like to start ; start a window like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged zone of the screen . below , this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fier window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor such as an mov@@ eable magni@@ fier . alternatively you can find a select screen menu or the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor on the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor . please note that the mouse @-@ like ; currently still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the standard @-@ k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
if you choose either , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse @-@ keys and change its size . this can take place in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the enlargement window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the contents of the magnific@@ ation window and move it with the arrows .
if you additionally use the &amp; Shift , taste or the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the op@@ tionally stand firm and only the lower right corner to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to file into a file to insert in the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turning the image and much more .
starts or stop the update of the display . the st@@ opp@@ y of the update means that the required CPU time goes against 0 .
select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , bar@@ ing , means , ho@@ ch , Very High ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will display . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your fil@@ ename to save files , aper@@ ture of a new window , prints , new@@ com@@ ings ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ern and multip@@ lier &amp; etc .
k@@ ills also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen sa@@ ils . you can enlarge a range of the screen , so as if you use a lou@@ pe in order to consider the printed printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for various people of use : from research or artist to web@@ designer or visual disabled .
for more detailed user documentation you can find with help : / k@@ mag ( specify either this URL to the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; a or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor a while on the same place per@@ sever@@ ed . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI Syndrome ( rep@@ lic@@ itive imp@@ in @-@ ins@@ cription syndrome ) and those of each single mouse @-@ click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click on the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer from the rep@@ lic@@ itive pen@@ alties in the jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and each of each single mouse @-@ click pain . this , however , it requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer because of the mere reference to the mouse . unfortunately , you suffer p@@ ains that are related to the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened .
in order to get it even clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by referring to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonom@@ ic assist@@ ants , the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click once you break the movement shortly .
is the intelligent moving activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after being executed using the mouse button . move the mouse until the end of the mouse button . in this way you can run the pul@@ ling with op@@ pressing mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this s@@ low @-@ time must be ri@@ dden down after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click on .
is smar@@ ter swit@@ ched on , the rotating season is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the descent of the mouse button is waiting until it leaves the mouse button again , if by the meantime no account has been done by the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the Click @-@ shift service . this feature is enabled , creates a slow search for right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ t@@ xt ; the first time started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times ; then click Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider Allgem@@ ein . there is a sli@@ der sound @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you adjust to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers .
once this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; Start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
all settings returns on the values that were shut when opening the dialogue . have you already pressed the button , the settings will be applied to the state after the last drummer .
best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all using the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent moving you should start off at first . if you then click into the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : the clicking on the neutr@@ ality components of windows and in places in the browser window that do not represent a link , does not lead to unlimited reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . like that happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole , in which the ball has been used . the dirt and so@@ iling can easily be scr@@ at@@ ched with a flat blade or the tr@@ ap@@ ern@@ ag@@ el scr@@ at@@ ching .
in very rare situations the operating system collap@@ sing the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use just an accident , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the surgery can no longer end through the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use one other window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; return and you can proceed as usual .
problem : if you input text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and thereby putting the cur@@ sor to another point .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor from where you want to have it . however , a conversation on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to call it out . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the titles lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit them .
the intelligent moving is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and move again or any other action , where you want to move your mouse at the pressing mouse button . however , some advice will probably be ready for them :
use the smart lock@@ out not when you are just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead , perform at an end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the reverse button , while you move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and then once again move the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this becomes every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when the smart move begins at the beginning . later you can use the smart lock@@ out even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are furnished correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is short per@@ sever@@ ed . this program has been designed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those who are hurt those of the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; also , can be con@@ figured that there is a certain time waiting for a pull @-@ out process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , the pul@@ ling can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program designed with the mu@@ te user to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the inter@@ viewer , which should be discussed again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left screens@@ hot ) you give the command one , which will later be used for the language version of text . further details can be found in the description of the description .
on the second page you can choose the standard text text@@ book . from the text@@ box you can often choose text @-@ pass@@ angers , without having to typ@@ ing them . the text@@ pass@@ s can of course be edited .
on the third hand ( right screens@@ hot ) you define the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ ess . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the incidence of individual words . in addition , you can get the list recorded with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can get the list recorded with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ment of your sent@@ ences ( the lower white field in screens@@ hot ) and a desc@@ ending memory of the already forgotten propos@@ itions ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you have k@@ mouth , properly installed , you can enter the propos@@ itions the propos@@ itions you want to hear . each ges@@ pro@@ ch@@ ene set is app@@ ended at the or@@ bit s@@ itter . you can select from it , which should be discussed again .
with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog includes two map cards , voice @-@ overs and setting , the page of Wor@@ ds and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language services .
in the input field of the box @-@ card language , you give the command to call the voice generator . in the selection field below the input field , you put the character en@@ coding fixed , with the text to the voice generator will be passed .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; doesn &apos;t know two ways to pass the text . select the cross field when the text will be dis@@ closed as standard input to the voice generator .
if the cross @-@ field does not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command will depend on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as possible as language service use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page is a stand@@ ar@@ dised interface for voice selection and which is currently advanced in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first choice of action in the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the box for text@@ books .
with the selection of instant , the chosen text passage will be directly spoken and in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage will be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box of the editing window for the text@@ book book , you can specify whether the text@@ book book is automatically saved at the closing of the editing window .
with the selection of text@@ books save the book is saved . if you choose changes , the text@@ book is not saved . select from Save Time , is &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book should be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ ior contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ ess . in the main window beside the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can choose the currently used dictionary available for Wor@@ ter@@ ess .
with the buttons right on the page you can delete or add the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and register the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads a score , then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . in addition , you can check the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are gathered , and how this can be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically adds into the dictionary , then generate a dictionary over time with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window for the processing of text@@ books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text@@ books are presented as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text@@ book or books add or selected text@@ books and books , you can either remove the tool@@ bar from the tool@@ bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text@@ books or text@@ pass@@ s you can change through to@@ es with the mouse to the new spot or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a tex@@ tiles section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ nam@@ e@@ tion .
the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the field of input a tex@@ tiles is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the or@@ nam@@ e@@ tion .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected movements of the or@@ nam@@ e@@ tion .
is this menu item in the menu , a ver@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for commonly used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default using the editing window directly under the menu bar . through mouse @-@ click on the left hand side and pul@@ ling can be moved to the tool@@ bar at another point .
if this menu item is crossed , a narrow cor@@ pse in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appear , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
is this menu item in the menu , a ver@@ able fri@@ ction is displayed for text @-@ pass@@ ag@@ gra@@ aries with entries . the ver@@ tex is arranged by default using the processing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the sh@@ red@@ ded left side and pul@@ ling can be moved to the tool@@ bar at another point .
probably you don &apos;t have the command of voice settings right or not complete . open settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice selection on map language selection . ( see the dialog dialog for language synth@@ esi@@ zer to further details . )
the Festival is an English @-@ purpose system of the Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is supported . the license allows to use the Festival free of charge and spread without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the setting of voice transmission , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice transmission is then :
Free@@ TTS is a in &amp; Java ; ground @-@ level voice generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS free of charge and spread without limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the language version , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example the option has to be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a W@@ av@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to run the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la are installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more costly than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la / de@@ ro@@ la / de@@ ro@@ la / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / t@@ mp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into a line . the option will be able to send data as default .

as the setting of language generators only occurs in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as possible as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting you use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , published in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; takes about 15 MB storage ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends in detail on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak out text through the calcul@@ ator . it will be a list already saved , which the user can always give new le@@ vies .

filters for drawing up a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or wrong messages ; it is a good example . you removed the tags br and b from the news , the mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this in most cases as assumed can be accepted .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in Fil@@ tering , text is processed , before going to the program Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , or to avoid a suitable language and speakers , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthe@@ tics and their votes .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; diff@@ ers four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the remaining orders will resume .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; win ; processor is to be hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message collap@@ ses normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you see &amp; win ; a long text on a website read , you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; k@@ not ; -@@ not@@ ices are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . any order that you encounter from the map card contracts is a text contract . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications that are used by text applications , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four of the order cards are processed in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the output of screen sa@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen sa@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such pre @-@ read , this issue will be raised and ended .
first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and y@@ ields as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in the future it can be still further types of filters .
string @-@ string replace parts of a text by other text . the set @-@ up parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expres@@ sions ; the creation of chat @-@ emot@@ ic@@ ons such as : - ) is made by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages &amp; conversation ; or e @-@ mail ; to a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ former use a X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from a format to transm@@ ute the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; include some X@@ SLT files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker cho@@ oses , you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program you send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set the text on the map @-@ card or@@ ator a female voice , you can read text from KDE news about it . Si@@ eh@@ y@@ . read about it .
each of these various filters has en@@ vision@@ ed rules , according to which he is applied for voice transmission . if the filter does not apply , that its rules are not accurate , he keeps the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a notification , warning or a message ; sent by all the activated filter that is set up on the page below . the processing of the filters usually takes place in the order in the list from above down@@ wards .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter are processed as a row after down@@ wards .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ filter , and it will display the characters below .
for the set of character files , you need to enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions as compar@@ ative patterns . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text .
type your filter a name . those names can choose any number , it just needs to distinguish by the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expres@@ sions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the character in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column . the list will be processed in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can load or delete a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file you can store or delete a list from a file , the entries file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
here is a language registered here , the filter is only applied , if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click at the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pushed down .
here is a value entered , the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : Kon@@ ation , k@@ mail
the Application ID pl@@ ender programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the number you need is we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the U@@ d@@ ungs @-@ ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter Kop@@ ete .
the drawing filter filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions can be used with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter , if all input cells is empty , the filter is applied to all the texts .
in comparison of words , the drawing filter terms in the form \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by part@@ itions ( space ) .
in this hand@@ book you will not find instructions for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; terms &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alog@@ s or add @-@ work as help to meeting these expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; expres@@ sions can be found in the k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Def@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SLT @-@ files from a format to another format . x@@ s@@ lt ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such surveys . it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the auxili@@ ary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H , it reaches x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker Elec@@ toral filter , you can send text to a specific speaker which is installed on the map @-@ card or@@ ator , or to a spokes@@ man with certain properties . you can specify for example that texts should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text indicates the filter there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker &apos;s properties , which sends the text on &amp; kt@@ ts , and the properties of the speakers selected by speakers . with the Spe@@ aker editor allows you to write the selected speaker .
here is a value entered , the filter is used when the text contains the in@@ given regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; terms , you can call this with one click on the button starting to obtain help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , d. h. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you define the properties of the desired speakers . if the text meets the above filter terms , the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements most frequently . click on the button on the right to indicate the dialog &apos;s choice .
use these buttons , to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker filter will only be applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box of Di@@ esen . you must register at least one condition .
the voice @-@ overs API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ;

none of the mentioned language synth@@ esi@@ zer supports my language . where can I get a synth@@ esi@@ zer for my language ?
I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; Per@@ former@@ filter , but in use of the module for festival , websites are not read out .
caused by an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of the di@@ phone so that s@@ able at all works . that &apos;s why you don &apos;t have to do so if you don &apos;t have this voice to read on websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or point of points appear to cause mistakes in synth@@ esi@@ zer , so that whole propos@@ itions are over@@ spra@@ yed or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure that the option character coding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a drawing filter filter . see .

the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , please take a look at the description of the synth@@ esi@@ zer to rate . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information which are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice synthe@@ tics . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another synth@@ esi@@ zer , please contact the team team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; it is not mandatory . Debian @-@ users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ on ; you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the content @-@ files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts from the source text , from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ - or downloaded the tar@@ ball from the source file , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first to check if Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is properly working with your language synth@@ esi@@ zer . you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ acking SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ is ; , which is the first version of Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g is to be developed so further that the setup of Spe@@ ech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ sem@@ bled into individual sent@@ ences . the user can re@@ boot stat@@ or or di@@ sat@@ lan@@ s , repe@@ ating the output or ab@@ ort .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the characteristics of the preferred speakers for the output . thus , if you have a spokes@@ man , whose language English and whose sex is female , this is used , otherwise , will automatically choose the best fitting speakers . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker selected , you will see in .
if you click on the map and click Add to Add a spokes@@ man to the list or click Edit , the map for speakers will be shown . as an example , the module set up for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path to a festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival .

the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works with you . in doubt select standard .
on this map card , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice entries :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is with@@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the stopped orders are recorded again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; win ; processor is to be hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks new text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you win &amp; win ; just a long text on a website read , you can take with &amp; k@@ mouth , nevertheless someone welcome the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen sa@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ overs in qu@@ eue a long one .
this audi@@ od@@ at@@ ei is always re@@ played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory message are active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is played in front of the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map will only apply to normal text applications . for messages , war@@ nings and issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice control , the talk speed , the volume , the sex of voice and pitch . furthermore , marks for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you need to install the Ra _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) because this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or tape at the Festival Con@@ figuration is not installed on 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and typ@@ ing filter filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds are subject to synth@@ esi@@ zed text in individual sent@@ ences . this means that you can also synth@@ esi@@ ze the whole phrase , not the whole text order . so you can also drop down or stop down and ab@@ ort , even though the language synth@@ esi@@ zer this does not directly support .
here you can see the rules of the proposition . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as prec@@ eding a propos@@ itional filter filter , you can change its settings or add any other stat@@ ute filter to beginners , but will not get out of it .
at the sim@@ pl@@ est you learn the arrangement of language selection by trying out . turn off the Spe@@ aker selection , you choose some features and check how the selection of the microphone is changing . of course you have to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the read can start since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the entire text block , which can take very long .
you may then keep orders on the map card or inter@@ rup@@ ting , even if the language synth@@ esi@@ zer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal propos@@ itional filter parameters will be automatically set up if you start the measurement @-@ gr for the first time . it cannot be swit@@ ched , just removed . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
propos@@ itional filters compare text with a regular expression for stat@@ utes and add a tabl@@ ature sign ( dec@@ imal characters are automatically removed from the text ) . please note that the default value of the default filter is included .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( re@@ wind ) , war@@ nings , news , or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed from verse the normal propos@@ itions filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file .
on the map module , you can write the speakers for the application . the map card is shown , if
use of the default speaker ( the top on the map ( speakers ) . in other words , there are no Spre@@ cher@@ properties specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which shows all the properties of a fully equipped microphone . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the microphone , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker dates . otherwise , the spokes@@ man cho@@ oses , the speakers , which originally described the properties .
select the method to enter the desired Spre@@ aders , by clicking on one of the choices .
select the properties of the desired talk . if this feature does not play a role , enter nothing .
highlight this chec@@ ker if the property should have priority prior to other properties . you can also set a number of mark@@ ings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is , it will always use as a priority property . it is the only case where you possibly want to specify the attri@@ bute , if you know that a particular application has been written text in another language than that in the work environment .
to use all the properties in the range speakers , to clear the following her@@ ein@@ after , click on the selection of the standard speakers and then use on speaker at the most indicated below .
in this case 0 is available for the last word order in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number ( no order number is the input 0 required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr rus@@ hes immediately when it started . I have compiled debug support , but I am not coming any recall .
G@@ Stream@@ er is cr@@ ashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , it may not be a compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update or un@@ install it .
the audio @-@ book over AL@@ SA does not work when I have to play music at the same time with another application . if I have a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears , the said : a to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts can occur at AL@@ SA , which can prevent the simultaneous aper@@ ture of multiple PC@@ M devices . indications for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for the festival on the internet . I installed it and you can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr this voice does not show .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / child@@ birth . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map card audio , there is a setting speed . that this works , the program must be installed and used on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synth@@ esi@@ zer modules like Festival Inter@@ active provide for setting up a setting for speed . depending on your chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( see , that the HTML is transm@@ uted in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very bra@@ ve , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML Um@@ former@@ pass , and set the talk speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I set out a female festival speakers , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day s@@ able gender does not appear to work . so the festival does not produce any mistakes , the X@@ SL file bur@@ ns the converting Open@@ SS@@ ML to S@@ aber , the Gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate character filter filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ is ; not more sat@@ lan@@ der or return . on the map @-@ leading orders is shown , the order is pun@@ ched only out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?

Festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ synth@@ esi@@ zer whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can use volume , talk vel@@ ocity and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts ;
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions provided with the festival , you need to read websites to read , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code from the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / / / Russian / . if you enter Russian votes , you need to enter the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ ns@@ h _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions you find the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the en@@ coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the en@@ coding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Kyr@@ ill , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ synth@@ esi@@ zer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and mb@@ ro@@ la ; then generates the audi@@ oph@@ ile . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ ick@@ center , which allows the management of net@@ interface , rout@@ ing and DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ cont@@ ac@@ entre ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop con@@ stell@@ ations via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ cont@@ ac@@ entre ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ Cont@@ ac@@ entre .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ cont@@ act@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installing a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ ick@@ center ; displays the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting from k@@ ick@@ center ; internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; @-@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning and con@@ figured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device itself shows and the adjustment of the network features .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the Inst@@ all of &amp; Linux ; and installed network devices later , the driver must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the core version , be loaded :
the module network settings is loaded , when the option interface settings in the &amp; k@@ ick@@ center ; -@@ index selected is selected . when starting the module network , this one is trying to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the suspension selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that the distribution and release date is best suited . by marking the setting non @-@ once questions the setting will be made permanent . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically pres@@ bi@@ ased .
the changes in network settings are possible only in system management mode . previously , all the options are obvious , which means , the settings may only be considered , the change@@ ment mode is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can enter by clicking the button system mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface is to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the rider network sections , the following tasks can be performed :
select network interface can be arranged by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface ... to be edited in dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below , displays the dialog with further possibilities .
with the selection Automatic the TCP / IP settings are done by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings is required for the system simultaneously with the start of the system services . therefore , the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server is required . in the selection list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP , according to the system .
with the selection of manual can be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field Network mas@@ mask .
once this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the system interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device box .
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or swit@@ ched off on request . turn off of an posted network you can activate by selecting from the list and click on interface ...

defines the IP address of the b@@ ills in local sub@@ net , which is convey@@ ed the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with b@@ ills in other sub@@ folders .
if there is a computer more than one network interface , the interface needs to the net , where the gateway computer is located , is selected .
a computer with DNS support is replacing a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be understood as IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will rede@@ em this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to nam@@ ing part of the e@@ quest@@ rian nam@@ ing solution enables a simple management of this list . entries may be added , re@@ moves or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and execution or de@@ grading in the list with the buttons , or are ordered in the priority .
by clicking the button you add ... from the group machine to nam@@ ing a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the dialog new Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the nam@@ ing solution , choose an entry and then click the button Edit .... There will be the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes b@@ illing @-@ to @-@ IP address for TCP / IP sub @-@ system . it is used primarily with boats if no DNA server is available . in small , remote networks it can replace the DNS server .
usually , the list contains particularly well @-@ known calcul@@ ators , some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ il@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses are supported . this still runs in the test well @-@ being version of IP must be replaced in future version 4 .
type the IP address of the well @-@ known in@@ voices and click Add ... The dialog &apos;s new Ali@@ as is displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the well @-@ known in@@ voices and clicking the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , de button add multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known maker from the list and choose Edit .... The dialog t@@ int@@ ed machine is displayed .
it may be one of the following tasks to run then with clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module process settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ tp : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of the bin@@ ary distribution ( usually r@@ pm packages ) is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively you can use a tool with graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice , but additionally the development of the development of libraries and other libraries are needed .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile . the following commands should achieve this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP @-@ networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PCs is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
currently IP @-@ networks are being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found big spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that it is going through in the near future . this description focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the understanding of which IP address is attri@@ but@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , on the bench ; the workplace is the contact person , which uses a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen freely .
when adding a private little ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address reports with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded to the Internet , therefore , its arbitr@@ ary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks are usually used in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually placed on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some ad@@ resses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the Z@@ width the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP rout@@ ing .
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL links , there is another content than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected , therefore can happen .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs according to a timetable in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX operating system cr@@ on .
when you start &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you will see a list of log@@ ged tasks and related ambient variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system and for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be checked and folded .
for a more de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed , and the description will be de@@ activated .
the added ambient variables put the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks and power . with an integrated variation , appears as a description disabled .
to create a new task , select first the tasks -@@ folder . go then in the menu to Edit New .... Tro@@ v , you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and click on the cli@@ pping context menu Neu ... or C@@ tr@@ l ; N press .
enter the name of the program starting to start the program . you can either give a relative or an absolute path@@ name . if you want to seek the program first , press choose ....
select the minute ( n ) where the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in fifth .
if you specify both Mon@@ at@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the task will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected month , regardless of the week@@ day , regardless of the date they fall .
as when creating new tasks , changes will only be active if the cr@@ ont@@ ab has been saved .
to cut a task , they first choose the too remote task . go then to work out .
alternatively , you can right click on the task and cut out , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; X .
to copy a task , they first choose the vali@@ dation task at first . go to editing .

&amp; g@@ dat ; is a backup program for new@@ com@@ ers on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to make several archives on a band . the first goal was to answer a surface for tar , providing the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar for quick , sel@@ ective output . the second goal was the answer to a question that asked my wife : how much longer takes it when you secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be involved by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen on three ways :
&amp; dat ; sp@@ ake the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the belt . re@@ alis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat ; the preliminary on the band will not be asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed .
recogni@@ zes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ch@@ ann , searches for the suitable index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band@@ name is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt works , in order to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar appears a corresponding message . the contents of the belt can now be sear@@ ched by out of the entry for the band .
before the design of the belt , the inclusion must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a change to the symbol of symbols for the band that the inclusion of the band is solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without any danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; to be used it must be run by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed .
a band type must be form@@ att@@ ed before you need to be used to save the data . this procedure does not have to be form@@ att@@ ed to the form@@ att@@ ing of the user , it must happen before you can be form@@ att@@ ed by the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ att@@ ed it is usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the Ban@@ der , DAT @-@ drives , however , not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the belt . all the data on the tape will be lost automatically ! after completion of the format , the band is automatically integrated and is fully operational .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the secure files you need . this can happen on three ways :
select a file or folder in a local file tree . it is only stored this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in a tree . it only lists the files specified in the profile .
highlight files in local file tree with a tick . only the such marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings the dialog will be shown . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the disk . it will only be checked for the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . it will only be examined the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on one of the archives and choose the menu item .
once the test process was started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialog you can check once again your choice and change the folder for verification .
if you confirm the settings for the review , the dialogue will review consideration . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data set and the remaining time .
before you can manage the re@@ produce , the files that are to be restored , this can be done in two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which includes an entry for the belt system . it will be restored only the selected file or sub @-@ folder .
highlight the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . it will be restored only the files marked and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu select ...
once the recovery process was launched , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your choice and change the work folder for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings for recovery , dialogue will be rest@@ art@@ ed . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process , as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band@@ contents . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently marked files and the standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be made . the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to your selected work folders automatically .
for all files which are listed under backup files , is considered that only the files are stored on the same file system , like the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ esystem , you can enter separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files have since changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files fails ; and lt ; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings by selecting the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Sett@@ ings menu . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to the device file for the band@@ wagon ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring variant of the tape .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; soldier ; before the band is integrated load the command mt from the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing instruments can be performed .
if the option is enabled , the option is trying to lock the rash at the tape &apos;s drive . maybe this setting does not work with all the band@@ works .
if the option is swit@@ ched , the type of integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the belt is dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option at Flo@@ pp@@ y Stream@@ ing .
if the option is enabled , tried and a soldier ; the hard@@ att@@ ing block size does not support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you need to be a soldier ; in any case you have to communicate the block size for your band@@ work .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the gang . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file will be composed as follows :
( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this character series is b@@ ent : seconds , with b@@ ills of the complete name of the system , where the tape has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the band was form@@ att@@ ed .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files in the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar -@@ Ver@@ sions should work , as long as it is not related to incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup bank . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system proto@@ col@@ s . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; ks@@ pot log ; experienced users the quick access to information about problems that may occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users to understand what your machine is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information on issues related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions provide , with their help the protocol files of certain programs are fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful functions . this includes a number of useful functions .
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba .
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens@@ hot , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , using their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort . the individual options for s@@ orting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting &amp; ks@@ v@@ log : first , you have tried to open the most important protocol on the system - the system protocol . if you have not shown this , and it opens , instead , you have a small disk window , so you don &apos;t have to find the protocol . the protocol files usually find under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user , usually no justi@@ fication to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected crit@@ erion . to display a string into the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection field will be displayed , next to the filter entry . then , a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns contain the string string of the filter server .
you can also select a different entry at this point . the string of the filter template will then select only with the entries in the corresponding column . select the column process in the filter bar , thus displays you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines . protocol lines of step errors are shown with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of step indication . the colored presentation of log lines can be swit@@ ched in dialog dialog .
if you want to see only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can choose the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window , to show all the new record lines displayed .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub @-@ window and once you have selected a sub@@ window , select the menu a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has an own website on ht@@ tp : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further recent information on the supply sources of &amp; ks@@ v@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ zent@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section holds a few concepts , and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V in@@ it quickly developed to the standard for the control of the program starts at the top of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful and also more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it system .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ ary file lies under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on System V in@@ it , without a re@@ install and re @-@ format . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that is the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead right in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ d. however , you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ tee , which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should sit down upon / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even though there is not much use for it . you can also run a r@@ c.@@ string in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run out something to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks for different places according to the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line as the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to edit it , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and edit the 3 . if you have a little con@@ verse , then you will fix it by rest@@ ing the system and execute the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you input l -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably will see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how do and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written that there is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this script from hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name and when the one includes , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people wish to set a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level , which can only ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ level level , which is &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not be tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or alter the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of the available system services .
note : entries are moved if you simply drag them to a new level . to copy them on a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select cop@@ ying from the menu edit or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the type of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the box numbers of the surrounding items before you can once again try to insert the system service .
note : at present there is no way to re@@ produce entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) and the C@@ ursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another Run@@ off , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with paste ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row drummer or the name of an item manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . include the dialog by er@@ ne@@ ous glands of entering the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to design the changes .
because of the danger of the amount of data , all entries in the menu file call a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard Run@@ level on a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE , or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) then you have to edit additional files in / etc . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way how system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are required ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; the running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user .
once you have made changes , you must save this . either you use the appropriate symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry store in the File .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two box @-@ cards , user interface and us@@ ername . to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears in the dialog user or group features .
some map cards are displayed only if you have enabled extra @-@ settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , will make a map card available to which you can make individual settings . other cards appear , if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD .
the card @-@ card password appears if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD .
