<seg id="14">The distinctive feature of & FSView; consists of insulated Order hierarchies with the help of a so called Tree map graphically. each object is displayed by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size has to possess the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then can be easily detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. according to that, & FSView can be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation you own the right-area meaningful shades and labelling.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched via color mode, can be either a depth for the light detection of the disinfection or the illustration of a different file type such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the relevant file or of the folder. for each feature, you can indicate whether enough space to be displayed at all or if the display may occur through restrictions on the sign of the Treemap. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the signage in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In display algorithms for treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item. at the Treemap in & FSView, this objective is not always respected. it will be frame to be available to the disinfection of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As is the distribution of an item for the subordinate items, the implementation is provided. here it is to be seized and into account for the areas of space so that rectangles, the best methods of this regard are rows, columns or record.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu view view. instead, a smoke-pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-ordered entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small application application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets, which was developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) to data transfer. the camera will then be implemented via the Picture transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may be used in terms of connection with the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicame; used the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which has an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. Winter2 also supports the Picture transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol based on the International Imaging Industry Association. it permits the transmission of images from digital cameras to bills and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. as photos are generally large files and transmission over the serial port slowly, this connection has now outdated. & digiarrived; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gphot2. a complete list of supported cameras will be available at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must be created with liguxif support, so that the prif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2. if the exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might possibly do anything or the generation could be very slow.</seg>

<seg id="147">& quot; digital snapshots takes on, categorized, categorized, asserts, transforming, preassembled and exported content to a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata are available according to your definition data, which will provide information about or a documentation of other data that may be managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly don't know & digiate;. the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving to which you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and you need to know anything in your system is to build up information structure in contrast to data structure. you have to decide whether to have other access to your own computer, whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. do not mind that you have to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. accommodations can be found quickly via your location. if you want to make enough photos, then you will use sub-folders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is a folder for images you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers could have different requirements like versioning the photos, archiving, workflows, constant assignment of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files, and you will not be able to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the pile, easy. separate new ones of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and labour-files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend using metadata in the setup page of metadata in & digiarrived; this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can detrimental the metadata from the database in the files by choosing the item from the item on the item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? it puts you to change a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select each photo keywords, comment and an evaluation. of course you can select all the images that will need the same attribute and then bet the value. you start the best with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense when you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now take us with keyword, keywords, as you continue in other programs frequently, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogous images from another source with built-in keyword, then & digius; automatically insert the tree for you to build the images to the right location. the changing keywords will be settled on a different one. the changed keywords are updated by & digiarrived; updated while it pursues the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are regrounded. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata about truth consists of many sections. filename and calendar dates of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to complaint or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most of your photos just as you want, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in getting your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Have a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! one starts to dream, associations, memories, the historical time-span is again present, you may even hear the silence. the caption has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning to observer, to help Him via the motif you have moved to what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect when the strength has only to work with a complaint for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digius; you can store any number of text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), when caption. you can even export it to your wishes into the marking and / or the title of the web design system. you don't have to tell the story for the opening-release a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times prior to GPS? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation have already begun with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of Geolocation decreasing are already countless and will open in the future as well. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can open your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data. you can also export the photos at the reception. you can also export the photos on the reception. you can export the images also to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps-viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word-game with copyright and refers to copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information on the one-way pages of & digiarrived; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it was not desired by the name of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization should be saved. after that this value it should not be changed. this field does not support cleras nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for use of the photographer): linked with the author. examples of this field contains the work drawing of the photographer. examples for this can be titles as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. as this is a note for the author's abstract, it must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the offer field to identify who the photo. this does not necessarily be the author. if the photograph is listed here, you can find the picture here. if the picture is a bearing photo, the group / Agency will provide the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections. anyone who has no protection against abuse at work with computers can delete or change the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Half-professionals, this protection against it is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per image. & digiarrived; will provide such a module for pile processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: PLATTENFEHLER, records, electric violations, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterprevention, age, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire. these kinds of losses are the same that you can also occur with traditional paper pictures or negative. in this section it is about problems with the so-called Neue Medien.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data-breaking company of the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem at CDs / DVDs, these cautious must be treated more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 pieces that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe this is in your messenger.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be readable, but you can store this risk in which you use good disks and good recording boxes, and they are not much more costly than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. it turns out to be the right option.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to error, even if you have just been written about. 75% of the data are just effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and controls. despite this massive protection they need by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For broken CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster das apparently causes miracles in CDs and DVDs. it is still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to disrupted data from damaged discos, harddisk, flashes, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to win the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual layer of Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB thus almost sixteen the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs naturally also applies to the Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good entrance on high quality media in a non-proprietary format. read then the media with a description, date & author and afterwards detainted on a clean, dark and protected area. do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read through this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discarmakers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing operations include a new disk, but not the data. Google will provide a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: disruption</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks keeping in the temperament area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C are the most common error message, SMART cannot determine this error. some of the SMART errors will notice the immediate forthcoming expiration. these are in particular readings and publishing teeth. the expected lifetime situation is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete vertiest due to over-tension. of course, you can also backup data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be back without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric machines doesn't make much out, the device starts with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause heavy damage, complete data loss, hardware design, destroyed motherboards and other defects. therefore, protect themselves from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blacktips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of energy heat is absorbed and the rest is grounded. it's usually available in the form of a jumper. don't think that any jumper will also include an overvoltage shield.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overhauling protection, then you should pay attention to the UL in 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care of the protection against flash envelope and thus protects the properly closed devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since any excess of cable can be used to your computer, you should pay attention to the fact that also all the peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems, as well as by doing a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cables of cable modems and TV.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overclockering protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, which is therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem. this means that you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overhauer protection of your system will not really help you with a complete fall. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-cut energy supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection from surplus-up, these devices can automatically be refunded. this gives you the possibility to store your data and manage the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are satisfied with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the underlying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">You have concerns the potential risk that your bills system is exposed and and compare its safety with electricity disruptions with the costs for avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you remember how well your computer is protected. at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-service contains S3 - Simple Storage service - a simple memory service. with the correct configuration you can use this as drive below & Linux; to use Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives, however, very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo-community 23hq.com. their free memory is limited to photos and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional variant will not provide you more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data protection, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically terminated thanks to the TCP-protocol and among the big companies it is included in the offering a backup and a divisible memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem and malfs put at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that you have occurred when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. it's pretty disturbing that there is no protection to your computer. nobody seems to have thought of it. nobody seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer unit than the inside your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission power, since they create interference in the data currents. at normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already, 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates that can deal with records on lower level and can be highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL-compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle launched a new initiative with its btracker filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms being used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data lukees for notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. with notebooks, the percentage of the theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most of viruses. it results in lower damage than B. theft or re-installments. and it is currently not limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been assured no more.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystem are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, itineraries, JFS and XFS, to name the widespread file systems. a very good English article on this can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigating process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an indefined status will be avoided before the problem appeared before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and smokables for all types of lighting sensors are no longer distant.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go into the direction of 10 Megapixocsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics. even DSLR cameras have your line with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format Sensors (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will get you today for 100 & euro; so you do not make any other reservation responsible for data loss. so you can secure your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any bit dangerous as the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of records or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on a remote SATA drive. if, then one day, a bolt suggests, you are lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroyed a lot. forget airplanes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasterate is always a local storage. bring your backups up the stairway up, into the neighboring building, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a backup loss in spite of safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files will be backed up. it is a snapshot of your history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files which have been updated since the last complete backup began. creates a complete snapshot at two timeline: to the complete backup and the last differentiation.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup began. you can restore the original status to any time when such a backup was made. this backup comes to a versioning system at the next with the exception it is only deducted and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to Script-controlled FTP sessions or other kinds of file transfer, rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you would like to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Make important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to have DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure lets you take enough time to detect losses and restore it. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further outdressing should be done manually, after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the image file stored IPTC files, original, memory, scalability, media, re-finding pictures and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewings,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">That valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in because they remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future because of your nature is unpredictable you need to look at all of what is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way than a certain vigilance has to be taken. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easily it is the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the statements made in this document. use or switching to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualisation is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay in open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is an expert-pressure for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means an increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's suppose that you have planning the scalability with plans and the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not depend on it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar (dd / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sad c1 # change the size of reiron if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is able to read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that is slowly disappears from the market. it therefore should not be used anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standards designed to replace GIF, but it can save XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-Bit per colour and Chromatious data for improved color information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow commemoration. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF may be stored in uncompressed shape or in a container with a slustfree compression salvmus (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open resource format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed according to the need for the need. it is now based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to the use of metadata: DNG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon as well.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is perhaps one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platforms; a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic of XML and RDF. it is compatible with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer a original picture of your recording, mostly in the rough format, to archive. XMP adapts, since it saves the metadata seperate separately from the image file, and as above mentioned it is noted, if you use DNG as container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization supporting a fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting the work on a architecture and modelling, discussions and joint work in the DCMI Communities and the DCMI Group, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections, and awareness efforts to reach a broader acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the dealer or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera edium are you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a refined processing, you can use external programs. if you want to edit the images again with & digiate, then you should add the metadata once again. these were under circumstances cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited paintings for the copyright with a digital watermark. export it only then in Webgalerien, exts you in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print them & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiate; in the section Adding a photo on an album you can add a description of how you have already installed on your hard disk. but the camera interface presents you with many advanced settings to import images to your bending database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digival, connect them with the computer, turn the camera to the ad mode and switch it off. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, this will try to connect with your camera. if the connection is established, a skill image appears at the lower end and the precarious images of all photos on the camera will display. some cameras are not provided. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for the file filment for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information on any entry. with the page, properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an item or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file features and the photographic information, which is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. please note that at some digital cameras do not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata like external, manufacturing, GPS etc. of the image. these information is the same as in the metadata sheet, from the main window of & dense; or picture editing. please note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the button Download and then you download the photos from her camera to a single album in & engiarrived;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safe in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired starting with the default methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download copies. the button-chosen template is loaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera is supported this is an option new download. these pictures have not been downloaded from & dense; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the Showroom. if you choose this option, you will be downloaded only the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you choose the buttons All you want to download or download a program, appears in which the photos are retrieved. details of the existing albums will be displayed like normal folder, displayed in the section My albums. select then the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After having selected the finish album, you press OK, and & digiarrived; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all of it at once, by using the button Clear, so you have to select them first and use the deleting exit.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera. therefore, the photos are not deleted from the camera, so you should carefully review whether the photos were successful in a & digib; if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete it from the camera, as this is significantly quicker.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially expressive name. the filenames are usually deleted once again, in case you load photos of various recording criteria into the same album. therefore, it can be useful, the date and time when the image was taken to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and spires of the picture and for file-based subfolders. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options indicating the transfer opens three more options that are stored before the photos are stored on the record. the first two affect the data on the author default. if you choose this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the text-information in the IPTC fields. with the latest option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format than the standard format, for example in the processing field the prefix photo-% Y-% H:% M:% S. place this option date & time to use. for further adjustments, you should be read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the option to change the filenames in small-case letters. or in large letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & dense; for a photo used, is displayed below the name that displays the camera in thumbnails. your settings for renaming can be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera image.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiarrived; you can use any information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time to carry out an automatic filing during the shutters. not all cameras provide this information. in the section side bar Metadata, you can check out more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic filing is usually switched, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch to automatic filtering, use the button Advanced and choose the automatic filing in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera supplied information about the date on which the photo was made available, can create & digib; this nemesis are based on the image data. not all cameras will be displayed in the same subalbum. not all cameras will provide this information. in the section side bar Meta data you can check which information your camera could be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off-off, and in this case stores & digiate; the photos directly in the finish album. if you want to change this option, you need to switch this option and choose the option built-based shelter at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos of their machine on their camera is to download. select then upload. the file choice dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files which can be uploaded. you can also select more than one file using the standard & kde; methods.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document, which is indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be indicated on a map. the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photo graphs it may be interesting to link up a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to manipulate an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents may use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgotten where exactly the photo was done, you can locate a postcard from another & digib; users who want to locate the location of the photos can thus be location, or simply wish to document the location, it is good the position-data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exivare assisted lots of GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and card reference. therefore, there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via an processing of GPS data and image files with the IPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and finally via the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receiver. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-Interface: CoyoteEye Ipaq Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be made with gpsman or gpsbabel. you have to store this data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical statment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from pictures and GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitudinal and longitudinal or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the badges Coordinate coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, the images in a higher resolution of the luminance is coded than in the color-formations. please read this article in Wikipedia to the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With setting of PNG compression you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery does not reduce the image quality, since PNG is using a free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can put this value on a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressing you can switch to the Deflate -compression salvmus for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the defect algorithm is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of a free JPEG-2000 files you can easily save yourself. even if you choose the lustacked adjustment, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & digius, the picture editing only an image for photos. currently, it quickly developed into a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default sampling is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option with a minimal loss of details. this option makes the image a little soft, eliminates but the 2x2 transmitter-pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the whitewn is used as equal to the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the whitewash is not set. standard is it a fixed colour balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting will be supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the sweeping of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps more details in the cutting edge. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the top spot, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to capture, as being persevering white. use the setting out unfolded results as they show the crochet in different Rosatönen. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the detoxes.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels typically do not get as fast as green and red. & digians therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixel. of course this is a matter how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">Selecting the option reconstructed, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the Luminanzwert to your taste. however, you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default one. but this can also later be made in the image options of the & digiance. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing - algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete picture from the partial image data sensor, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix colourful pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or Farbrekonstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm of crab. Bilinear is interesting when you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-babing of your lenses, you can set the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a sootable correction, since you are performed during the pipe.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translated the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there are also LCMS and & digicame; information such as the color wrap from a color tree in the other are to translate the colors as closely as possible.</seg>

<seg id="315">Determine Settings of ICC profiles you have the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed by opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color-view view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are not managed with the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camerator and model that you use. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or Gammacorrection. currently corrected dcraw Gamma does not apply to conversions at 16 bit depths. this means you need to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually correct instead of being on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile is provided for what is provided. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiling along. this answer is obviously inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the destination: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; imagery and image processing. by making this interface can assist & digiate; many modules were supported to work with each program, which support the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the IPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the one you want to use, and these are then loaded by & digiate; all modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks which can be performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings subcommands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules you can get via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manual books of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diaschau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator cleared the time between the image processes, normally 4-5 seconds good. the other antocks turn on the metadata on the lower end of the images during the display.</seg>

<seg id="327">At the bottom of the end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) -mass storage cera. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / re-, specify on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digival, you must connect and turn the camera to your computer to turn it into the ad mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Probiere you know if & digiate; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will be displayed in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any designation for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can fit all of it here.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digiarrived; includes a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and correction and improvement. the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item advertisement</seg>
<seg id="338">The picture editing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digians; therefore you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current date folder, augmentation factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A toolbar at the top edge and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, no of the features will change the original photo before you save file storing or the button save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original foto once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with file save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the menu file recovering the button Recorder Regenerate in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last time.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of the image processing can be reversible or restored. the last action you can reconfigure, by reviewing backverges or be restored by selecting rework from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to reverse and Ctrl; -turn-old-Z to re-produce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB on the back-board or re-knob button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you choose one of the menu-items you will also have the actions set in between also backverted or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the picture editing, you can move between photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image runter, or the entries in the menu file, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can get in the photo and find out zooming in which you can use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the use menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can choose this button in the toolbar: enlarge factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you usually come into the normal view. if you do not want this, you can change this in the dialog dialog by & digicame; change. these can call you out of the & digier; main window call. see this section for setting up the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image file and get the standard & kde; pressure dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print some images or whole phrases. all images can be printed out of your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu item Exportiert Druckent. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiate; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and campaigns for the selected images. it is displayed, without the navigation treatments, even in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders will be clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on because same rider leaves the sidebar seem or again disappear into the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the capriftment view, you can enter or insert signs using unlimited size. this means that all special characters are permitted. the complaint form are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are illustrated according to 2000 characters and special characters will be formed. if you want to use the IPTC toolbox in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented on, you will either take the button to apply or simply switch to the next picture, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the add-button there is a button More. with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database. but this will always be done if you've chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section review presents an assessment of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sings. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars into the sidebar or with the shortcut of Ctrl + 0... 5. the rating of the sidebar is always applied to a picture. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them from and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follow the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyview reveals a searchbox for filtering the keywords, the keywords, and a selection box with the previously in this & digium; -session addicated keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keytree is dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have lots of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering the keywords in a picture series. if you have given various keywords, those are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the respective cross fields in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images selected at the main view, and select a keyword in the keytree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, if you want a selection using a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar sample-filter is used to change the selection of the display shown in the main window. normally, the left sidebar will be used with their album, - Datum-, casting, and search views. if in addition, one or more keychain may be used from the right, only the cutting-quantity of these two are displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and imitate them. suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and then select a dialog, which you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example the main window shows the images of a calender date. the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords which have chosen the amount to three pictures. they were drawn with Strg + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keytree to the selection and put it there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be disabled under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and determine that it would be one or be, you can easily change this with a double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry according to which in the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a virtual search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the cross-field at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like follows:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked at & digicame; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-controlled workflow, the colors will use of your camera or scanner to have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-controlled workflow, you can reach that colors on your monitor those of your camera or scanner, and that the colors you print or publish in the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme centered on color administration, everybody has to express what buttons he wants to make for the results he wants. unfortunately, the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration. in addition, you will provide you with deep background information to make your own informal decision making you get the desired results.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all the criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about the administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color tree. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are by email or the web where sRGB of de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everybody so easy, why should you use another color tree and therefore have to worry about paint-hits?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation of sRGB compared with the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hureluous region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensionale representations of sRGB with some larger colour show, so visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on information and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I brickler my monitor if I have decided to work only in the sRGB paint room?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you're working in the sRGB paint room or not, you must finish your monitor succession, since sRGB goes out that your; onitor operates at sRGB. so if you're working as a farmyard of sRGB, you need to use your monitor to the sRGB standard, to use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool displays five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you try a further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, automatic, automatic deequals and contrast to expand from the menu corrigid automatic correction automatically try to make the best out of your colours. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which affects the best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminous negative values about the whole image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color gradations. this function is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abasting: this method is readed the illuminator of the colors of the selected image, so that the Histogram of the Intensity scope is as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparative very good results in improving the contrasts of an image, sometimes it produces just trash. it is a very powerful surgery, which causes either wonders in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic lockers: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue-channel. you can select the dark and bright border tones and readed the red, green and blue channels on the complete Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Reast: this method improves the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by the moving the lowest and highest values in the greatest possible field and a new jiusting of all values in-between. this is only visible in full pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-distance from & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white pees of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-right correction is something limited because about a color tree can occur with 8-bit per colour. in case you can perform too far from the original image, in case you can perform the white storks in the tube mode, which means in the 16-bit mode, your possibilities are correct for correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salary of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it on the menu-order colors white-like picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The curtain range can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and preview of the tool. if you want to view the original white background, then click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The Preview of the target pictures has a red marker. the Luminary of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right up, a histograms will display that dynamically changed once you have a parameter. this story is very helpful, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixel very small Lumin- values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminite.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow's shadow allows you to improve the shadow's ails of your photos or download them down.</seg>
<seg id="401">Vstat with the above controls are to play, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image show to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white wash. this type will also automatically set the temperature and green values automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white-right with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color canal is overexposed.. you will have the combined result in the whitewn indicated. this is shown in the thumbnails as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this. any adjustment of the whitewdrop you have set, you can save it into a text file and recharge you again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The knob settings sets all filter values again to their default values and the associated neutral whitews. note that also, neutral settings will be a different photo than your original image. if you save this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the codification of the ordered image. 8-bit encoding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. these coding also requires more disk space, calculating time and stands onlyable for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG available.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog like the processing of color pictures. it uses the change and transfer of color profiles. colour toning can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detectable instructions for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors Tonoplasty. this tool provides an integrated path to save multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always have the same correction. in the manual for key correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of correcting problems is to correct the tool for Gradation that you can find below colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & dense; tool Farbeffects gives you four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canteen filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabato, a effect of the evolved when installing some partially developed printing of a short lightning. this had the effect that the lighten areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to be easily aligned with this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar zation. at approximately 50% intensity the image shows what chemically possible. a further increase is ultimately produced a negative image, that is not to be created on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original image is the (1) and the (2) the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the trademark of FUJIFILM. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated color can be made for the film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated paints are also some photographic photographers, especially those most difficult landscapes are light.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlicht to the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the fever reps the strength of the newcomts. in large images the filter allows the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the color counter and the luminosity of the photos. you can look for experimenting with the different Farbasins of your photo with the tools in the menu. once you are happy with the result you will use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can get a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the envelope with bad lighting. in this case, the tool for brightness / satiation can reduce a good choice to perform the saturation rather than they can perform. if you can perform the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / Gamma is the tool key-correction for improving the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool appears very complicated, you need to explain here the scope of the fever. more concrete the three slider below the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the Intensity values, a histograms, of active canals, or of the selected partitions. under the graphs are three fever into the inside and can be moved to change the core values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the shelves to look at how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted, if the histogram is often represented with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images a digital camera is often dominating. in pictures the large areas of a constant color will dominates the linear histogramming of a single column. in this case, the logarithmic entry.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three shelves: the supreme for the dark sounds, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones, frequently gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color chains can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically set the input values of the shadow, middle and bright notes automatically. in addition, there is an knob for full automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two regulators who can be used to change the output values interactive as with the input values. for example, the compression of output values can be used e.g. to create a hidden picture as a background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this knob, the image values are automatically set depending on the Intensity values of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the files created in the filesystem and later loaded, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and use the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readed for all shadows, means and Sundays. activate the paint clamps which you want to use and click on the thumbnails of the histogramms for red, green, blue and the Luminescale channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposure indicators controls all channels to find overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification: this selection box allows the channel to be modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this casket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a short trip to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones will be correspondent with darker and forks the corresponding image text.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this markings in the field you want to change will be a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is readed to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with this buttons, you can do exactly this. each bend that you have created may be stored in the filesystem and later loaded. the file format is that Gimp is generated.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you want to create this method and the three color pipettes automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all the channels of shadow, middle and sunshades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and Luminanzvv.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposure indicators controls all shades. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result shown. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in Luminsican. shadow and sunshades has been applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel blender of the & dense; image editing is a tool to improve the channels or change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel Mixer of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel-selection box you can select the color for the story: this gives you a first hint about how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">Preview the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the Histogram to display you the corresponding resource value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you also retain the option of Monochrome, as the channel Mixer then DAS tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of one color is visible from the color canal which does not appear at the same point in the color canal and their smokpatterns will differ differently in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you want to reduce the paint first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any any blender setting you can save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-channel format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposure indicators controls all channels to find overexposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been newly aligned. the option Luminanz is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photographs, black / white a workhorse, since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer. even with a set of film rolls.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white filtration with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenery images and fits perfectly well with portraits against heaven. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) Grünfilter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangeilter: simulates a black / white filtration with a orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangeilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white filtering coating with a red linens filter. this creates a dramatic nature effect and can simulate moon material for day time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white filtration with a yellow link filter. this is the most natural color-tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) Yellow-filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and middle tones while he adds a bit cold into the shadow of a print and the re-development in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & dense; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your picture, irrespective of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the pin of an old master, a pop species from enlarged points or how a wall-picture can apply on a wall. the menu item PHP application can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper Textureffekt has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and this changed under (2). the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & dense; tool boxes can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to set up a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the stretching eye. under the picture frame the module can be started from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you make the desired size type for your image. thoroughly rumped the image with a coloured line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), coupled with a nice three-dimensional framework of ideal for a button-effects and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: sets the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text in one image at any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text-device, orientation, color out of color tree and character. you will be the drawing size of image size. the larger the image, the greater the character set. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background. already, the image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any adjustment that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button "OK". after that picture has been stored, the text part of the picture. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digib tool, you can apply a stencil about an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in the image processing can be used to put an image via an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions or size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should add with maximum compression (9) to the reduction of file size. if you want to add your stencil files; simply send an e-mail in English to the & digicame; mailingliste digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil folder with the button base folder in dialog. select the folder in which you have requested the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencil has been set appears a belly-view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil and reflects the selection of a folder, the showtimeline is automatically updated.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the enlarged factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the above image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Decrease: this knocked below the underlying picture. it is centered on the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the stencil to the whole picture, you must cut the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to postpone the image below the stencil. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the stencil to your picture. the image will then be automatically adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiarrived; three different tools available for blade holders. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool to sound. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, granny images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Nonsharpened mask is working on the contrast the edges of a painting look like. actually, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was made of Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Resign is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in his application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharks. this in turn leads to a common colour together. that's in turn leads to a common colour together. the same phenomenon can be observed whenever hanners are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more bearable vulnerabilities as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">At JPEG-pictures is often a camera internal sharpening applied. images in the pipe format are always required in the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner is already using a scaler image while reading the image. if you disable these deactivate, you get the control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by placing a photo with the Schärfen-Reverine. you can call it with the menu-register of conspine sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should be careful with this, as the results are not very natural: the sharpening increases the sharpening of edges, but also intensifying the smoking. in general, the need technique for sharpening an image will reflex in the tool. you can reach it via the mending contract. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to cuddle.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: one image is too crisp. the solution to mark the picture a little soft, is much easier than it is too sharpened. use the tool for smoother. use the tool for soft touch with the menu item and experiment with something with settings. it shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mashed is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview the image to edit. the preview feature shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should first try out. an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you make the dissharpness masks to make strong, rustling and the impression of caves in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius poses a how many pixels on each side of a canned by the filter are affected. high-resolution images allow larger radios. you should therefore watch pictures most in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the blurred image one of the original is added. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The Corpora value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the use difference. one can therefore define a minimal difference thus for a channel of filters. in this way areas will be taken with a soft switch between the tones of sharpening and therefore avoid beauty faults in faces, skies and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited painting (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">Das & digikam; tool refoker refocused one picture by improving the sharpness. it used to copyright infringement / algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image & quot; refocused on. this is better approach than just trying the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it usually makes better results than unsharp masking. you can start it from the menu by calling colors reflex in the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular protruding is much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche's Faltung has a very long tail, which depends far from the original source. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular protruding. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most images the default value should set 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but then to be vitalized.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced the tougher effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoker filter: an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 but rarely useful. if the filtering filter is too low, & eg; 0 will the image quality is very poor. a high value is 0.03. a high value is still further polluted.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche's harness. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid resourceful artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might also need to increase the correlation and / oderthe smoker filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matress size: this value determines the size of transforms smatrix. an increase in the maturesize may cause good results, especially if you choose great value for the circular sharpenters or the Gauß'schen country. however, in most cases, you should choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any reflex parameters you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity encoctions in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and compressing, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces unsharp masks, better results than blades. this could be caused by the blurred masking of a larger neighborhood than husks.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, to be blurred masking always to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the dissharpness. practical terms, the result of FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the Unsharpness Maske. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better with the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture that has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analogous camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light to the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of scaffs in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regler Glätte puts the irsharpening of the area of the fuck-dark, in order to create a natural cleaner.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte makes a adapted colour for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to not remove desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Ina algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are shown below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering settings, you can use the rider Glamping and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of details. a small value leads to a moderate upgrading over the image. a value of 0.9 should be sharp. a value of 0,9 should be obtained, that no sharpening is required. please note that the detail management always should be arranged.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alignment of the Alpha [0.100]: a small value added evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie gritt or create CCD Rauschen will create a high value waveable patterns. JPEG Artefacts will be best with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Believing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor about alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, you attach this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is prescribed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is through. usually, here 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Multi-gradual integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, there should also be small. pay attention to that small angle to generate a long term. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral Strange [0,1, 10]: integral Stride range in pixels. you should set the value small 1 to avoid sub-pixel baling and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the More about quality that you get through the choice of this option is only minor. he then doubled the runtime. we therefore recommend it to release him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this. any adjustment of images error can be stored in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Images error is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still be very long and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how graphical errors have been removed with little artefacts. the module is made on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogous camera. as you see, there is a peculiar warm art act in the foreground, that is caused by a bad film breakdown during the trip is wurdel.The original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiate; smoke-reduction is a very powerful tool to rub images. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool establishes a selectable machine filter available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. by dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory from the camera or moiberute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor screw from digital cameras, so you can check them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granting smoker that can be successful with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced configuration settings may remain in the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can switch the image. by the radius is moving through the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the pixelapegel. this value puts the pixelderup to determine the filter changes. you may need to redefine the edges of the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and rustling or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the chimprecision for the harness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be the whole noise, or smoke-tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a shaking noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminosity of the picture. we recommend using either color or luminance to change to a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerances of the image. we recommend using either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamble tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically outraged stronger, but it is also the shadow of shadow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjittering. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is responded to. if it's increased, the edges of the edges can occur. if it is too high, smoke and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. he can remove smoke-tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the process reduction you have set, can be saved into the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how long-reduction of your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and this corrected with (2), which is applied with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes an image is crisp for your purpose. the solution to mark the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than one image to raise. use the tool for smoother with the menu item and experiment with the smoothing. it shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicame; photo restart is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photoartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restart gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts, movie grins, scratches, compression, compression, and local errors that arise in digital, original or detrimental images. the smoothing takes place along the image styles and thus gets the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textures, with a different tool, the image error correction, executed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / Franc and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts may reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a distressing compression or quot; - small standards that are shown in the uncompressed image. this attitude is intended to correct such problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Laden do exactly this. each adjustment of photo restration can be saved into a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restart is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to get off. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-shaped smokes,.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensation of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous filmstrip on the faces. you can see the original image below (1) and this corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restart. this time textures has been reduced to an old color photo which has been applied with a scanner which has been created with a scanner, and the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Das & digikam; tool hottext allows to remove photos taken with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it is using algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-built oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove & quot; name pixelquot; and" "" "light pixelquot;" "" "; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button image. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to discover the dark's image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark-image will find the bad pixels. please note that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview you can correct within the image the result. the preview feature shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken out in all preables.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels in the preview and the results of the filter. select then the best filter method to interpolish this pixelcard. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Dursection: it is determined a average of the neighborhoods. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional Interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all Pixels which have a gap of 1 from the pixelblock, are pulled to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolish the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixelblock are moved, to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolish the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-Cuban surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolish the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hottext correction on a color photo, out of a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to. the original image has increased to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digius; Vignettistic correction is a tool to correct the vietting, i.e. underexposed places, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Expanse objective, in particular that in the middle and large photo format, can frequently illuminate the entire SensorRange. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there. Teleobjective shows may also be this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has cons. many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the Blending filter, which it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. vastly objective should, even using center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or less, since otherwise immineffective effects arise by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by simulated by an equivalente transformation on a raw image which is being used without this filter. the tool Vignettistic correct is applied to an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three shelves you can control the vigor filters and take three more the exposure to target audience.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light generating the filter at the point of the biggest density. the default density is 2,0, what an optical filter with a sound setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, entrupt.increases the density to compensate for a bigger degree of vigor, reduce it to compensate for a little degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma-settings: the machining of an image with the vigor correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to redefine the exposure to target image with these options. the regulator will only provide positive values available as you only need to increase settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer realy of the target audience, so let the values for illuminate / contrast / Gamma during zero and use the Gradation from the & digiance; picture editing of the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vigor correction to one image applied. the original image (1) shows the motifying in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast-correction was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiance; Linsenverdistortion is a tool to correct the impact of celerical lenses on photos. it uses such copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric forfeiting. colored distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or conv.exe form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third ridge has a similar round-effect, flat but at the edges. this correction is not being used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The Koefficient fourth Grades corrected the distant corners for the opposite of the second Grades. if you combine these two, each geometrical distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values, tons of perverb can be corrected and positive values can be concrested distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lentils, the 'bracket parameter has the ummed sign of the parameter).</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction first grades through. negative values increase while positive the image is smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value cleared the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">In order to help you find the best filtering settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values that you use for your image are stored and used for the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction or concreatively correction should be performed prior to all Zuschneider or size changes. in case you cut a picture new and then perform a tons-shaped correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction line, this tool provides you a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move the mouse button to fix the lines in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point. afterwards, you can correct the tonnellar / concreatic aberration with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a concreatively distortion, the resulting image black corners. you can transform them using the accessory tool in the menu, cut out of the image processing, or over the zoom Regler to remove this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonnage goes down. the next logical step for some motives, such as photos from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct that all the angles in the image 90 degrees. please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnage correction is applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared-film the GimpGuru website of the GimpGuru.org Website. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensation of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window you can select the area for preview for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate two parameters set up film granularity and film-sensitivity (ISO). activate the ISO Regler changes the amount of film granularity and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transforming. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter color-channels to reproduce infrared film misses, particularly the green-channel makes it no sense to use the effect on black / white photos, since the color-information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared-cinematography applied to a landscaping photo from New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of aura in the cutting edge.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & dense; filter film granularity is a simple to use device to reproduce film granularity in your images. this is known of classic high-speed filters, such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitiveness of the films the manufacturers great silver grains of photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The movie's graffect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to postpone in the past. in case you want this special, gallery-like, street pictures, especially in your monochrome photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the Körner. the default value is, although higher values are required, to ISO-2400. if you need even more kernels, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the movie's body available on a black / white image applied. the original image is the (1) and processed (2). the film-sensitivity is equivalent to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicame; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & dense; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to affect this effect. the top chooses the pest size between one and five. thicker brush are better suited for large images. smooth controls the glasses or, from the other side, looked at the charity.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and which edited is marked with the (2). the original size for this 640 pixels big picture is 1 and glassy 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiate; filter coal-drawing uses paint and intensability to define a coherence in the drawing. therefore images of their gradient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to skating yourself. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper shelves choose the foundation size and the lower readed the contrast (gloss).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the drawing-pass filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default image of 30 and 10 were used. the result may be further enhanced by adjusting the Intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digival; filter engraving your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiate; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where colour does not use the most important at the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity, to transform the image into a gray, moneyed landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and processed image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a artwork by distortions, it uses copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: shares the image in cells and makes it look like it is looked upon by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogue to the wavelblocks 1 is distorted to the picture here with another version of glass blocs.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of nonsharpened effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Ubli: blurred the picture along globular lines that originate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imsharpness: blurred the picture by rotating the pixels to a center. this simulates the blursharpening of a revolver camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: blurred the picture to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to emerge in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement blurness: blurred the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the dissharpness of a linear motifying, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft mark: hidden the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle energy.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shooter: blurred the image by random shift of pixels and simulates the insharpness of a arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart blurness: finds the color-pool in the image and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the picture in rectangular cells and then creates it with filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and do a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops in your image. this gives it natural your images a good look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows the size of the drips to change. since the dripping size does not automatically increase with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the quantity and density of dropping. fish is changing the optical effect of the drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & dense; picture editing an area free of rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentine filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by spires or turning into the right orientation. the tools can be transformed into the menu transform or transform it.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo in a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to waste is simple. the big question is, how can you find an image inflatable when the limits of dissolution can be achieved? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below.</seg>
<seg id="632">To change the tool in size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Lots of image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicame; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available at the rider New size and are recorded below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: when this adjustment is enabled, the entry of the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is prescribed, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons are used as and loading are used accurately. each setup for photo can be saved as a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take very long and a high CPU load to move. you can cancel calculation at any time with the button bead.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable, by increasing a small image image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of the linear default penis for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The brakes of a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a often underestimated tool to form a picture. to cut a photo with the mouse just throw the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, create. you will then see this rectangle then check the mouse move.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change a good overview of your photo according to the cutting edge, by moving to the corners of the rectangle. simply create a new rectangle by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cross-section, use the button-cutting button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file saliva or file storing in the menu file to store the newly opened photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the background, you can change the size of the rectangle by changing the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool after aspect ratio, you can indicate the orientation as high format or cross-format. in the high format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format of width will be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool after aspect ratio is a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can see for example a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons for the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Bottom in the dialog, you can set with the Max. relationship knob the area to access the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool after aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the screen-orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the intersecting tool for the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the modified images are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the open image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the implementation support allow it to be insured, so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particles based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party gel, harmonic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles into the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division which is based on various natural growth pattern as for example the spiral of a Nautilus pussy, or the blood leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The Golden division is the irrationale number 1,618033988... and it was used already by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who made their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have put together the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number leads from the Fibonacci episode 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from, where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding numbers. the resulting part is 1: 1.618 the Golden Mitte. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center represents smooth service lines when you put an image below. these help are recled below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you better results for your photos. compared to third-party gel, the Golden Spirale creates a liquid line of the eye to follow through the image along the line of the spiral along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the Golden Spirale, also called Golden reef. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also guided from the top of the Golden Triangle. your vertices are the central points of the golden triangles, golden triangles, no equivalent triangles and triangles. diagonally placed on these lines can place a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, you create a effect of professional photo grapher Dynamic Symmetry. try to place your picture battery in one of the cutters and other visual information in the triangles and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and Vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can adapt the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it happens easily that you're not exactly vertically or horizontal. this creates an image in which things are filmed for an angle. you can fix it with the & dense; image processing and tool free rotation. choose free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider again to 0 degree. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is free rotation and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor to position the two lines. after you have moved it through an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you shot a picture you will find unwanted feeder holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transform into use from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is a Automatically Zucut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out around one fixpoint to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red Quadrate at the corners of your image. thumbnails will then automatically be recalculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information which can help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation occurs in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation occurs in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle from the top left: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">Following the adaptation of the perspective the picture gets a little polluted. for a single adaptation is this effect small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you acquered the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way of getting this is the picture with transformed sugar cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The activation tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite. it is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can transform this module into transform.</seg>
<seg id="679">Push your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertically at the same time. if you press on preference, the angles on zero will be set. a preview of effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the front line.</seg>
<seg id="680">With your help, a vertical and horizontal line ends. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the activation tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the padding, the image will be a bit wasted. for a single shift this effect is usually negligible, but two perdings can be dropping twice as much wiser and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After sheetching, the picture has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is to transform the picture with transform plucked out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Present came; takes a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been computed. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of images formats with & digians.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats, but you will always be JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="843">The module MPEG Kodierer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length, convert. this module uses the packages MJpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a base material in MP2 or WAV the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can choose a backcolor for the slides. with this module, it is possible to create DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the mediums you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images that can be packed into MPEG Diashau. then you can create the module for extras: Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected are then reported on image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. if you plan to reconnect the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV Standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds the one picture is shown below. a lower value creates very sudden, a high on the top change of image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The color-color can be set next. in doubt you should let it be black. the name and path of the generated file you can specify the name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind the duck-off.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the film. after all settings are adapted to your wishes, you can start with the button code to drink the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your bills you can quickly leave a cup of coffee and enjoy the diaschau when you are back.</seg>

<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows you to print several images on a piece of paper together in default sizes. the combined images can also automatically print with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to print you or with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the commandline tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. ein original zitat von Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw files which should be converted and start the module. the Raw-Bildconverted window appears then in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now optimize the values to optimize the convergence process. the first option will decide whether the camera settings may be used for the whiteboard. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjustable. if the result is not optimal, you can proceed to the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrasting information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switches is no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the filename remains identical and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a luctless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the verlustfree LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you are going to process your images often or you later go otherwise in advance, you should not choose the JPEG format before the image quality is worsening. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you want to select as storage format the metadata that are included in the RAW file are contained in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted to your settings, you can start downloading the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use this process.</seg>
<seg id="863">The forklift-processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. use this mode therefore when you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have here the possibility of existing file automatically rewriting. this is helpful in case they have been created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. however, the progress report indicates how far the conversion is progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and timestamps which should be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a file collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge the image or enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the orientation orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pressure preparation: prepare the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photopapiers. the target image, including background size, boundary size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are attached to a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best adapted among the free-free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you want to select under pictures file format and the original files in the JPEG format, then the original command data will be added to the sendends pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so you can see the status messages, looking for errors, however. your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. with the button closing, you can schy this window.</seg>

<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; displays you two options available to create HTML pages with your images. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum. in the following part of the user manual, the installed in & kphotoalbum, which you can create over the menu file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following each area is described more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the blicks and a description which is supposed to contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum, HTML-example pages, you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select you to see if a & kphotoalbum; -export file will be created, which is to see on the review page. approximate information about the export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information is shown on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed at the viewer. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. please note that all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, why this is not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions to the images and possess a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no images can be downloaded, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified. thus, your images can be seen with low resolution, which will result in a shorter transmission time, and if he wants to display a picture larger, he will switch to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you specify the different folder and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best to select for all your HTML files, select a base folder and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and you can select for all future pictures of the location. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if this really is visible for viewers. if you choose the base of a URL, after the pages have been created, started. the URL you should specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder, you must manually copy it. to ensure the import function, see, properly functions you need to specify the final aim of the files, but the base folders in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings are covered by all three on base folders and URLs. in this one subfolder, whose name you specify in the file folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're looking at a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already been telling a lot of time for viewing the images, people on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import them into your database. the picture features will be imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ in the file, whether the images are stored in the file, or whether the images are stored in the file, that you have all the images together and thus sharing this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this is an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is searching the images in two-fold way. first, the images are not found, so the images of the URL, which you have specified when creating HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the exporting images described you can call via the menu file Exporate...</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether to act in order to act internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option manual near the .kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "with the" "" "automatic" "" "option to copy the" "" "kim file copy" "" "button; the pictures automatically for you." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim -files are normal Zip-files. since most images are already associated with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is worthwhile if you want to get this anyway, just choose the option export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is maximum image size limit. if you want to send your friends photos, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by example, for example, that each image has a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file imports... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to Importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category persons interested to importing file personer (if you are a Dane) while this category is called in your database. therefore, you will be able to import the categories of imported file and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can choose the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example will see you on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures to browse and look at: when you see images, one wants to see often inside different picutches & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will take the different steps from (1) consolidating the information about your images, over (2) the gateway and reputation, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations through.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program for the management of your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes your videos. in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions at the CVS, where they would like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used again at the future start. if you want to read another database tree with images, you can start using the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu subcontracting settings; set up... you will come to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following sections of the user manual, you will be explained the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">Left you see six different symbols with which you can access settings for viewing and the options for the viewer. for each adjustment stands a detailed help available, which you can call through a button print on the F1 button and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can specify for each image different qualities, e.g. individuals, places and tags. you can also create your own groups like items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">On the view you see the dialog, which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in the dialog Options you can set up full members, i.e. all members of one group at once in a group, rather than explained all the groups of a bank membership.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view you will see the settings options available to you. with the top-indicated selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left-box, a list of the current category and in the right is a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system means KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. seamlessly information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have however a help page that you can view over the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications with each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; demo recordings are always tested first with the demo album, before you visit them on your own pictures. demo album -demo &lt; userpath\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via IPI, are very different, making it may be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can use their images in albums: here, there is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, so you can simulate the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here are simulated & cold album: the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also has to pass a list of albums. here, & kphotoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotographer's browser; s browser displayed in the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category is an album of the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums, so if you want to use the category 'category', then do so if you would have selected people and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible are you can remove them from the list of modules. start the dialog dialog, and select in the module modules that are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a boot screen, once you start your photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, take a look at the top of a menu and a toolbar. at the moment, you can't find a lot of information, since you still have no information about your pictures. in the section, we will look back to this window, then click on the entry page, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see each image with notes. on the picture, where the image has been included, you can put each image either individually or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures of Jesper, you can see all images in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for viewing and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you see three lists with a text box by selecting individuals, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, as you will always use them again if you input information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the relocating the images inside the list: if you have for example a family-party and shown at all 50 frames the same 5-10 persons, you can, so that the used names are moved upwards to find the people faster and arrange.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting the date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any remarks on each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provided these pictures with comments. click in this case simply on the front and back buttons, which are shown at the picture of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item for multiple entries at one time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California all lie in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the US as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overview, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the acquisition dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also draw an entry into a category and put it there in order to sort this to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this requires that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the different elements of the item of particular, by form the glue that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by pulling it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the button options... which offers you the opportunity to store up the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and here window one / exit. this procedure can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry image in the browser you'll get an overview with demonstration of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filters to be set here. you can configure the size of the display images, by simply down the mouse button with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easily.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this picture is furnished as a background for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will display in the picture record. if you have not yet opened a window with a photo display, a new ad scan will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images from the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete or select either the Remove button or select in the menu edit menu. now, the window will display you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you for this problem a solution. you can also use with & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can also have the pictures stored anywhere, so that & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum. if not all necessary images can be loaded from the disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper edge is cut is not stored on the hard disk. so, for the images 5-9, however, the views are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can also view these pictures with the picture viewed.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you would like to copy files from the folders and then copy it. if you would like to avoid the inserting of the respective CD. if you want to avoid the intertwist of your images, please buy a larger disk to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you can find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little bit of privacy, you want to stay in the end ones you want to see for others and click on the Current View locks in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also view all the pictures that may see your little sister, waxing and waging the menu item Alles except contemporary view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Therefor you have fixed which pictures in the case of the case shall be hidden. if you want to lock the laptop with your little sister, you just choose the menu-related images, which you will have locked up. if you want to view the images again, click on sparse.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be disclosed for the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. at one point you can access or delete the password as an unencrypted text using the password as an unencrypted text only. those type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and hours over hours with it is of course you want to look at some point. for this reason, & kphotoalbum. for this reason, features a picture _ and video recordings. this allows you to preview from the preview, as described in.</seg>

<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, so you can easily drag it with the mouse and elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. this then clipping context menu you can see below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see the appropriate entries to this page. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all images from Anne Helene. as if you would have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and image below. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as diaschau. however, then a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or minus. started and stopped using the Diaschau by the buttons Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability to switch from & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch to the full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer, you can get in the picture and get out zooming. with the minus button you can get back rinszooming The plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle indicates, and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomt. with the equation-key puts the zooms, so that every pixels with the screen corresponds to the image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Keep in mind that the only zoomoperations work with videos that fall in and out zooming with the plus and minstaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the actual picture with the menu item from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you can look at images it may happen that you may have forgotten an image with a person whose name you may forget to look at the image and open the configurations dialog of the image to insert this name. however, you will be able to mark the image and consider further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start watching the viewer with the pictures and start it as good or bad while you're looking at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the viewer's option to show some features while watching them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letters. in view, see a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you want to edit them in your browser, just print them all at once using notes. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be shown in the view view. if you want to display categories in Dre Preview, then you can press features to the images by simply press the letter for the characteristic when the image was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on an image. for that case allows you & kphotoalbum; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. the way you can revert your gemon later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see an image on the painted game. to switch the painting mode by & kphotoalbum. to finish the painting menu from the context menu. to end the Malen you simply put the cross in the toolbar top at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler, you must not control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation on & Povray; you should be read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wiremodel views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all the items already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object-tree, select the item you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the toolbar or select a menu item in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be built, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under machining or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed characteristics, click on to apply these changes. have invalid values indicated, a message telling a fault description indicated. then you can correct the input text and apply again or put the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the Povray; -user-documentation in the dialog dialog, you can visit the & Povray; -reference to the displayed object with the help visit.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can view a preview in the individual's own views.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the peculiar view and a small example of the scene will be selected with the selected texture. as default, the whole texture is selected, even if you just want a subordinated element (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture Map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can pull these checkpoints with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the centre for scaling and rotation, as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through brids with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Every object appears as a wire model a visual level. you can indicate this value relative to the level-level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only be shown when they are selected or their visual amplifier small or the same in the toolbar of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler: has a window order as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window orders or if you need a different arrangement, you can use them freely. you can also store multiple linders and simply switch between different regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window on or under a view, drag the beginnings at the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of that view and covers the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views over each other, drag the beginnings in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the cardboard box top in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order form a webting views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchor, drag the beginning on the desktop or click on the small to the left at the top left in the bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the bar's bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu, you can find entries for any kind of views. new views are chatting, you can anchor them to any user.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with view window order... save it. it will display a dialog in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler: use & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written in & kpovmodeler; Version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon Rendering The symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item scene scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">One Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many Render modes, from a quick preview of high quality levels.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in the toolbar, or select "Render Modi" menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can input any name, but sense is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map card size you can enter the width and height of the rounded image. if you only want to rename a small area of the picture, select the cross-section downside and give the picture cut to rendering into the input field.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the drop-down field, you can select the characteristics which are used & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex non-diffuser reflexions-illumination. a detailed description of the Render features can be found in the user manual and Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is structed with only one ray depending on the pixels, these images often have a Moirè pattern or stepless effect in curves and lines, sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">The Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling rests with each other. the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because every pixel continues to be split up and adaptive because the Recorder version depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray identifies a beam per pixel. if the difference between shades of a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling are processed. if you adjust the low value to 4, a grating of 4x4 points will be calculated, at a low value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated following: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays of pixels. if the difference between colours are divided the predefined threshold, the pixels will be divided into 4 subpixel, which will be pursued individually further and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of record can be set with the low value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is called Jittering process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changing and Povray; the rays order for a tiny amount to avoid regular pattern.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse rélexion. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light-reflection calculates. it takes very long to let a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can indicate whether the Alpha-channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. one pixel is then transparent, if the associated rays are not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; if & Povray; unexpected, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; -scene to import, select the menu item file to import... and choose a file from the Columns window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler: not yet the complete command of the Povray of & Povray;. when registering error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support implementation in & kpovmodeler, please write this code between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can draw objects from the object-tree into the editor to export the code text for & Povray. to import objects in the Editor. to import objects in the scene, just highlight the code text in the editor and drag it to the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and paste in & kpovmodeler, and in your editor, you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler: a scene in rendering. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the ownership view, opens & kpovmodeler, the & Povray; user-documentation for the displayed object. here you can find the path to your documentation and the version. supported versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example measurement data) in the paths to the & Povray; if you include files which are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire-models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for the display of the selected checks points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the field in the camera view and in the window-type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-start of the points to the rester in the context menu of the wiremodel's view. you can adjust the edges for shifts, scaling and filings.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the indicated objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed stages for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High Detailed view for extended projections, all the wiremodel's views are further divided, if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall behind the objects will be crossed. the wall is depicted in a chess column, consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor is structed below objects. the ground is depicted in a chess column, consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate the chasing order, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold may be set. more exact details about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window ordinances or create new window ordinances. in the section window arrangement will explain how you can create and store linders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down field standard console: displays all available window frames. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window frames displays all available window ordinances. a new arrangement can set you with the button added and extinguish a selected order with the button distance.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order. new views can be added with the button to create and delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with monsters, you'll get a cardboard box together with the previous view and floating view not in the main window but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">You just have just & Povray; and now you want to start with no closer knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, to be very popular: a ball on one layer.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully notice the following warnings, before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you adjust no camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you make no light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, take a look at the first start of & kpovmodeler, following voicing Rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation, so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item references. you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel display shows how the camera views the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice the scene from the scene of the camera. this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will find the content of the view object, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's guide to & Povray; find out more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved, but note that the camera can change in the view points, simply click with the left mouse button on a cone point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button, or press the input paste, change the wiremodel's views and the object-tree instantly according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a quader (inserting physique quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a comprehensible method of resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler: does indeed offer a simple option. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object-tree, change the name and push the button use or the input paste. in the object-tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel also indicates the level, even if at the moment only as a limited-scale level. if you rendering the scene, the layer extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can look at the object tree, you will notice that you click on the icon + before the object. in this case you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will see only the different parameters for each object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the skyline so you can get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Only choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted. please select the name in the property tree. you can view the name in the peculiarities view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the button preview you look like the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a Mattes black material because you can check settings for pigment. therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on thumbnails. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see color on Quader and ball, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if your image is now running with a click on the icon, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the colour you expect. here are further settings necessary. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called paint colors. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object-tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run out, since you have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler, which can be understood just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the intercaste or the button to press) so that the ball has float above the ground, since you have moved the ground by one unit to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering is now a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball surface is like a Mattes black fabric. put the following step of the suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can assign it to a material right now. as already in the floor, enter the sphere a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Erstes subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select a color and make the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on to apply or press the input.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflexion features already some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & grevmodeler is. hopefully, you have already learned so much that you can create simple, but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytrayarios is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you trace a scene raytracer, shoots the renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the observer (d. h. by the camera, which will reflect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and like atmospheric effects such as fog. thus, the scene Pixel for pixels worked.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene that is supposed to be rolled, some light sources and at least a camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual dialog dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard dialog dialog, you can select a file that you have previously made with & kpovmodeler;</seg>

<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the shortcut unit. you can change or add new commands with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool-ons for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A platformer map is a way to predify the surface without any bump on the surface individually modeled and without change the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Plots are simple geometrical shapes, which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens of dozens of dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, by using a image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can be used with Amarok and Amarook. the easiest way is to use the command dcop, which should be included to each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. usually, the function exec is used. in this way, dcop &gt; relatively simply can be called: here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this reason, shrubs should be monitored continuously and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to preview the listing and loading of ordering data will take care of each script yourself. if a script is run, Amarok takes the labour folder on the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amaroks's script can also install script packages, which have downloaded the user & e.g.; from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.bz2) compressed. we recommend a archive name as z.nbsp; B. strangenpt.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as Amarok's script.</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the package of Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have Kdeliverb (including the included programs, because & Amarook; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile Kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD decreases that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org.

<seg id="1246">Mostly, this is because the paraglider crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this bug to the taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try again SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is something more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of the libraries were compiled using the same compiler-version. if such as & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib but with GCC 3.3.x have been compiled, then this leads to overthrow the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable you. switch off, if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail is automatically sent in a crash). if it is a frequent overthrow and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program can write data as UTF-8 in the meta-info, but it is not listed as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& K3b; is how many others & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface with the help of this interface can be controlled parts of the functionality for example via a shell scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can use either the command line dcop, or use the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programmes are crucial in the functioning, therefore more your taste and the type of your requirements will be crucial, which of the printout programs you give to.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we take that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP; you need to make sure you need to make sure that & K3b; started. then give something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program reported, supports & K3b; mainly two further parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface between & K3b; features functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions to test new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataType Project () DCOPRef createDataType Project () DCOPRef createDataType Project () DCOPRef createDataType Project () void ReatDvd () void burnCdImage (curl url) void burnDvdref (curl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: "K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project can be obtained via # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject. through this reference it is possible to change the project through K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectinterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only available on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1495">& caudiences; is the user interface from cdparanoia (for reading from & CD; data in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many Kodierern (compression). currently, lame available for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (computing packages) will still have to be installed from Linux distribution. additional codiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD will be read and stored in WAV files on the computer (free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per caption) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats like the lustine FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudio spator; cdparanoia. nearly every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodierer are already available, so it is very likely not necessary to compile some Linux distributions too. however, only the codification packages are not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be done (the dialog dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration has been found), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD; on the hard drive explains. this leads (hopefully) to understand for the slim approach of the user interface, about which you can frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the dialog dialog for the type of notifications (such as protocols, piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; ends).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog dialog by & caudiences; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set up the encoders). so far, you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression-rates and helps you to choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a luous audio format required. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can give these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information generated by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model are MP3 and OGG the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower Bitters (up to 128 kbps) but over this bitrate, the differences are less important since both codiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still provided with most distributions for free but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high tonns (at high Bitters), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at low bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer-based music system, and / or if one of the few existing OGG Abduction is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as Standard DVD player, portable devices (USB Stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car-stereo installations. today - in the beginning of 2009 - these devices are mostly available only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--Preset medium '= This option brings good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--Preset standard '= This option should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most musics. acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. need up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo, high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo, high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint Stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good gendered for music of youths, portable devices and car stereosks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--squeezing Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or obtained through the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be handed over / used with & caudiences; and the body's code to create the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprogrammes, there are often a combination of program settings for the codierer and these parameters here. the manual or help with codiles explain the switches for these programmes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) when MP3s will be coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter from & caudiences to be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & caudiences; parameters that can be used (= Knopfbeacon in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can load the audio CDs, so that all the other information can be downloaded instead of yourself into the computer. it is noted that here only text is spoken by: & CD; title, artist, behalf of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberry: that's the author, I can prevent you from the & CD; any more or less worthless, so the artist can be inflicted by the artist or the music. all information can be obtained by a Bummel through a & CD; store, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & caudiences; is active a cruising field (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieve the data from the server (This may only be used only the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & caudiences; for use of freeDB is set up, the geographic server needs to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the bills.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of reflection on the online pick-up of & CD; information on the read of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only to update the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that it is used to be cdparanoia; who is always the best choice for reading audio CD; see below is that the cdparanoia package has to be installed from suitable distribution first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To Save the WAV files, the Kodierer can be chosen and thus the desired file format. on the first opening are the defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a free-free compression for audio data) on the Data tab. other Kodierer can be added at this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code-package should be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also required for the predefined codes. more information on Kodierer are in the chapter Welder Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodierers you can get more information about his switches, by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; Console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check out the device designation recording of the & CD; / DVD disk drives, the writing and readycle of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; and this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this tips can give how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set out those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and read all our first & CD; read by MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) of 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. any suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, since it is not necessary to compile data files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own it (eg; by trying to copy with the conqueror something.)</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers basic usage of & caudiences; something which presumably be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each outon & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the use of Kodierer to compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with, freezing the freeDB to load the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it from any selection of a & CD; once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device designation is delivered to the readout program so it is able to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real devictor of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be specified, then a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the equipment used for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map for General Settings. here there is no much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything will be given so bellow as in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of uncomplete information please choose, so that you are advised if information is missing for the tester of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map card CD; settings. just choose both items. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected with the Internet during reading the & CD; so that he can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, a & CD; entry now begins to read the reading of the & CD; and this is linked with low-file name / filename or a day-file, they can easily be modified with Konqueror &gt; rename as modified and the ID3-tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, further to note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, you can start using freeDB locally in offline mode, if you want to use the database before. however, this is worth considering using freeDB in the Offline mode, the two choices must be selected at least the first. the mode is set on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB-server on the Internet. how do the system which data to get the CD is set? read the section about freeDB. put everything in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load is distributed among the bills. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function incomparable what the server is concerned, as though a lot of firewall is the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first application field should deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp on your computer exists)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number simultaneously extensible pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel Reading and coding? the author does not know it, therefore simply trying.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last song, you cross this to cast this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want to cross this folder, then the folder / folder can be stored, in which the WAV files are stored. it may not be useful when the files will be installed in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything as it is in the screenshot. the command is something long, under certain circumstances, something must be broken down to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--squeezing extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the result of this result is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and energy efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the creation of tags to Version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary, in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously looking at codifying WAV files: at a dualCore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can try to exclude more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic establishment of & kaudiences; ends. this configuration is used as default for each outreading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described how the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, which is described in the previous section and is set up. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will need to pick up. the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each bookable & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD included, which is not yet contained in freeDB, the screensphotos show a little different from those for a & CD; with successfully issued by freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually input instead of taking them out of the Internet. comments will point out to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this sample s can be found. it is a "special" issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet happened, now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this is only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be read and by cdparanoia can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then ask in the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD; successfully managed by the freeDB, all tracks of the pieces have already been filled out, and the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; indicates, a window will be built, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion the best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross-field for automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you have no local database, but the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>

<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1-tags. this limited the length of fields on 30 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2-tags, you have unlimited field-length, at least on what & caudiences; maximum allowed. this option is set on the tab labeling settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & conqueror; window into the & kmid; this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be presented and even better: the event type is automatically selected, allowing you to manually set anything manually. so if you have selected anything manually, then you have selected the karaoke text in the menu, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a event, select from the menu settings the entries file events or songs. the same function also have the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in line. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collectors bearings. here you will find the menu collection under the point of Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the fake at the collector's match.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection is not stored. you have to add that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected at the collectors "ager. there, you can add a song with the knob button. it also appears in the file dialog, with which help you choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece is added to the opening (using file Open or drag & drop) automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not enabled, the opening of a piece, the temporary collection is activated and listed. this collection will then be added to the continuing pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you have to open the collectors bearings, select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series according to the submenu of the menu collections, the songs are played in order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or remove or random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collectors bearings, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, choose the next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back, select the button previous piece, the entry predatory pieces from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collector button, choose the collection of deleting collection and click on the button Clear.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not being saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map General-MIDI events in events that can understand the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map, converting all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in Events of the Change File patch to Trumpet and therefore always leaves a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all soundcard GM -compatible are (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text file that stores all necessary realizations for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. prerequisite for this is that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END, that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI can be assigned to your specific keyboard. general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches lie in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard drives not a gun patch (GM-patch 127), you can take a Drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun tip. to this point you carry the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term "Drum Patch of the patch, in which every sound is a different percussionist (Drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the sound means the tone-height of the ever same drum (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds on a particular channel or instrument are illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their availability. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to form notes on the Perkisses channel. take a look at the provided keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to create some channels to other. if you want to share the first and second channel, make it easy at CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a particular channel (general MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-devices need16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built by following the pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N it is the channel, which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap must naturally be defined forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored that will change the patch on this canal. in this case patch x is used as patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful for example to always use the perplexing patch on the Perktrek channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio indicates which ratio of pitch-notification events are multiplied with the value n, this is calculated with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed it only. the value 4096 is used to stand in the map file no decimalkommas).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives you that a keyboard that is supposed to play a pitch-mail event with the value 4096, a tone above. unfortunately, but trying some keyboards by two tones to play up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under settings, item MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row keyboard (one for every MIDI-channel). on these pianos you can see what sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument to a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to preview the played sounds. view the view settings in the menu setting under the point of canalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is recorded. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that includes information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while a mp3-file you need a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments, the speed & etc. you have control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; have happened because & kmid; with no Awe support was compiled. to remove the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example by kmid; 's Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add an entire folder to a collection, but I do not want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreeing, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror;, select all files and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Activate earlier the setting of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow-button on the left of the Tempo- LCD replacement to relocate the playback. to restore the default speed you can double click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & kde; -desktop one & conqueror; -windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or I'd like to play a file, just enter into the & conqueror; drag the file and drag the file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without giving them equal to a collection, turn the setting of automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection of added files.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, adjust the setting of automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock yourself, also B.mid and C.mid to play and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your soundcard. it's not the same if you use a FM-device or an axwe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no soundcard, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card except that you can of course listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to send the Favorite links under the menu bookmarks but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are going to be played down, so you should use the category of playlist playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to create an additional hierarchy of hierarchy. if you are entering an entry, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category and the playing begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' uplight piece ', television and durability playlist can also be changed by direct edit the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & kmplayer; not running through an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a category of a category clicked out of the menu view and displayed as next reference mode. by the clicking of a subgroup is displayed only the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">According to changing XML files, you have to choose the same with playlist from the menu or selected either the delivery mode, or another category will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the machining mode is left or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Owing to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at Starten and Beenden may be disabled by the edit of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can simply be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1718">The animation at Starck does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate through the opening of another source. this would be annoying at the end of the animation however, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; maturing the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When view the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed and regarded by a mouse-click on the respective changes.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; once a DVI; -file [device-indispensable file (engl. D e V ice I ndependent File)], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -sources.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI-file contained a description of the format document and also other information such as the font, and also other information such as the font; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and smell.</seg>
<seg id="1765">If you are interested in solving the DVI-file, the elements of DVI, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file click here is the exact opposite of it. once you click on a section in the & latex; -source code was clicked on the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer-viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master Document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, the work with other integrated .tex files are simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick: the & latex; -code is compiled and the result automatically displayed (if no error in the source code is available).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; -file to Ã "nderunâ" miswaxâ "and it is not a call by & eyepiece; after the quickset.</seg>
<seg id="1769">For viewing the machining the workmanship should be stripped of the three grooves of common items in the document. the initial selection field is for quick integration of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The vertiable & latex; commands may include:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box other is for example of articles such as tags, Fuels, notes or references.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a defined name (selection, choosing a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">While wasting quotation is displayed a selection list with literary entries. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & b; s & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e will be used for setting up the fonts, the typeways for the main text, the FuÃ "notes, etc., there are the following typeways to cover:</seg>
<seg id="1775">At the call of & kile; there are two choices available: 1. the assistant to create a new document by selecting the documents and scope of the settings. 2. the document may be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays the typeÃ ¶ y one. will the typeÃ ¶ sess not at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the top-code example has been typed the & latex; -code-text will be compiled. the easiest way to do this is using the mento or the bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The implementation must be saved from the compiling. & kile; for the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Slim the compression of the document, should be sought in the logging of errors. if using quickset, & eyepiece should be started. if this is not the case, the protocols should also be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (cf. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the restful document. for example, a report with the writing process is created and only a few ropes are created. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ end {environment} have equitable its Ã ¶ nbing of the typedestÃ ¶ e within the surroundings, "" "" Riesigâ "" "(enf.

<seg id="1781">The changes are merely applied within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no circumcision (number) for impairment within one environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for the readability of readability and usability of the document. it can be used for example certain fonts, fat printing, cursiveness, submissions, etc. these commands are either configured with the command\\, or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is long glow, until he is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quotation in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After writing the source writing with the & latex; display language, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in assistants a bit of text was typed, a few adjustments to achieve the better readability of the document should be managed. here, you should get a quotation, a few places in lipid and Curves and a poem to apply to see the differences of this precepts.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor or Ctrl can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer), with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI-file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript file. simply try out and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a detectable file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -transformers or computer monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed (in the viewer) (if the printer is correctly adjusted).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar attach the conversion of DVI; -file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; -file from the & latex; -code version has been created, the conversion can be converted into feit other formats by means of chest strap.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search results for the direct leap from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. this must be used only modern under settings Kile... tools bauen.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to pick up the preference, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in one line of the source textures and asleep on pre-search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer will then be done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; compatible and available to appropriate line. there must be defined & kile; in & eyepiece; as a text editor (setting eyepiece Set... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should in the case of rapid construction of the & DVI; viewers do not Ã ¶ ffnen, there may be a mistake. should an error occurred, this is displayed in the log file and in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The protocols file obstructions the error source in the source code. in the editor, there are always the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the log file and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document. the preset features are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting such document, a document can be written either from scratch or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document. for more information on this topic are included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Cropping users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be stored, stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file contained or a new file is created. & kile; a new template can create a new template by means of a document of an existing document and selection from document templates...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file new, some string chains are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can set up in settings Kile... Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCENTAL $$: this string is replaced by entering in Documentation class. typically, they will be used as:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the attacking of commands in the editor. once the document has been created to this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then its own template is balanced rather than by default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. becomes a simple way for creating a template used, should be searched for one in the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many adjustments for the menu, can be made directly from & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more on Emerald & Kate; and its features would be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; have you been able to start reading the chapter with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called for mentioning LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all precepts, which can be found in & latex; usage can be found, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with penetrated Strg -button to adjust the & tex; -words, that in this way is balanced by clicking\\ par by\\ par\\ bigskip just\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with a drilled mouse button, the full text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">If you use the arrow buttons with penetrate Shift key, can be balanced parts of the source textures in the monitor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; the features varied the most different types of source codes to search and to emphasise this. for example, the & latex; commands of the normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can make up the jumping mat in the text. the menu popup springboard or the appropriate keychain can also be highlighted, so that it is also highlighted to the jumping side, so that it is automatically squeezed during the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Working is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; important functions for writing a & latex; various commands have been added, many environments and groups and therefore underlined; special commands may contain the following commands to contain the text-selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt includes a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines). with a paragraph includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive matter in & kile; is that the passing t are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aroused the word under the current Cursorposition. this selection has also an extended meaning as this command is also & latex; commands with a return risk (\\) and a vastly star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To the lenschen of a part of the document can be removed from this first and by pressing the button def. & Kate; offers the touch panel Ctrl; K with which the entire row is removed. under editing, the following commands may contain the length of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description of survey evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore it offers & kile; for the other commands some work as well as simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command is sung to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor will be placed directly in front of the command to the remote location.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will be sung to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is directly placed behind the command to the lieve of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor from or within the command\\ begin {environment} is located to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many intertwined ambient commands may be quickly lost sight. this command includes the most recently mounting environment, so that the wasted ambient structure does not disintegrates.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under machining TeX group are a few important commands that suit the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is sung to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command is sung to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is), the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; -group #, is sung to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many slaughterraced groups of brackets can be lost quickly the remote sight. this command includes the most recently printed group, so that the slaughtered structure of the & tex; -groups not disintegrates.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple initial translation is used in & kile; the character is used for two simple beginnings. also for the end of the initial mark, the character is "used. & kile; knows this case and also includes two slept next sign for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insoles of the double initial mark can set under settings Kile... LaTeX in- and left-out.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also include lÃ ¤nderspecific settings (e.g. ngerman or French), and thus German or French beginnings. there are also many other languages to be found.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When looking for Shift; input paste and kile; an intelligent fuss wrinkles. if the current position inside a lists -environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize) is, for the current position inside a lists (e.g. enumerate or itemize), but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a tables environment are slept & kile; the current line with\\\\ with a ashing enclosure off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments to underland. these can be added by settings kile; setup... LaTeX</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables - environments and thereby all Et-signs (amp;) to assign up to each other. although this tulator is trying not of the corresponding tabulator, for the back-hungry, for the columns, for the columns-position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code completion, this in & kile; in order to add special orders (mostly for & latex;) there are also three for need and the other two are for automatic understanding. all these modes can set up various working procedures under settings boile... suspend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment by using the command\\ begin {environment}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When returning the return taste, the last character of the input will be removed and exacting, so the list can be reduced by entering another letter even smaller.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, descriptions are removed from & kile; also jumping brands, so that a simply jump to these positions means using machined jumping brands NÃ ¤chest diving is possible and the best parameters can be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">With settings kile; set-up... kile; comprehensible settings can be made for these lists. there can be different wires comings for tex; - and & latex; commands, as well as wound closure of the general voice available.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the comprehension of environments not to land. it is always a few letter with\\ begin, and the call of comprehensible mode will have a great list with ambient temperature. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for understanding the environments to create.</seg>
<seg id="1844">During the call of comprehensible processor, the MenÃ ¼ ber Old + Shift key + Shift key, the command becomes unfolded of the environment automatically and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued by the simplest way and by pressing the input taste.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a lists location, even a first\\ item -command is consolidated.</seg>
<seg id="1846">With settings kile; set-up... kile; comprehensible settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the winding result of the defect-mode and tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; Mainly custom lists of covers, which are instantly replaced by number of settings... Kile Versioners set up. as an example, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word compressed the MenÃ ¼ ber Strg + Alt Leertaste, the letter L replaced by the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">GroÃ ¶ e WÃ ¶ rtermore are not useful for automatic mergers. however, it was noted that many wound in a document has more than once written. thus offering & kile; the understanding has been written for all already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menu setting sile... Kile Verfully shifted. here also the Corpora value may be defined for viewing of understanding.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a package, we begin using the plug-ins for plugins. this dialog will open:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows, to manage all the plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search box. when executing plug-ins without a storage place, and quantaplus; this path to the seeking of plug-ins.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leader and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out from the list of teammers who he is. this happens when he is searching the team member from the list and replace the button. the currently selected member (their identifier) appears after which you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and notes. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Beside the overview of their team, there is another advantage by collecting the members of the team: the event can be created an event to inform the team leader when something happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that will be executed when something specific to the project happens. an example would be how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into the CVS once it is added to the project & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event's event-configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings, and events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments through the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Submit comments is simple. it can be selected either the note -entry from the Editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary box, followed by contactment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes may be sent to a determining member of the team. in this case, the syntax is the name of the team name (nickname) or @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (nickname), play a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader, subproject leader should be introduced in the relevant area or subproject names, as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: Mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. by means of the default standard the standard specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard-coding coding: coding from newly created or in other ways than using file opener files (where the coding of the file can be bypassed), however, this setting will be loaded by the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not detected, but this setting will be loaded from the same in the project features, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; created regular backup copies, so that with a blackout or overthrow in the next start of the program the document may be recovered from this backup. it is not the same as saving the file. even for yet not stored documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the time you created.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editorial area or in one's own opinion (or the documentation in a box), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are sprouting-applications from third-site, which can be reused by any other-part application, most known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plug-in if it is not on a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be transferred to the plug-in at the start, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folders.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only" read "mode: check if the plug-in is denied boarding. only-read-kits usually refuse the store, if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; whether the specified information is correct. pick the storage system if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the error was completely renewed. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead of which, a debugger-Plugin concept was implemented, the various Implementations about plug-ins allow.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a matching Debugger plug-ins in the project settings. with the button options besides the Debugger plugin, the specific settings may be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If for a project a debugger is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>

<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to debugger, if required, or she shares the plugin to listen to Debuganation. this action is caused by default when a project is opened, so that a debugger is not necessary, so that in the normal case it does not have to be respected.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or ends the leaf according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to see the current document. the output of this requirement is shown in the view of Debugger edition.</seg>

<seg id="1985">Points the debugger to start with the execution of the script, without information about overwatchful variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is appended, the execution continues. happens before a debit request begins, the execution starts as soon as a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next statement on the script, without entering the functions or decreases.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next statement on the script, and if possible in functions and includes faultless.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to pass the directive and go to the next as if there is the current not.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, where a variable or expression can be inserted, the supervised value appears in the variation view.</seg>

<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods can be a script required from & quantaplus; on the default input. in the optional entry you may be determined what to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected Text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% of the variable is usually useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the performed application can be diverted. there are two types of output: normal output, to which standard default stipulations. it can be specified by which the text should be done to the default version, by adding value the selection issue is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to accommodate the tags in logical groups. in given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add action and configure. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts to start working mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes have and you intend to use their use, activate a dialog "day" to call, if available, so that a input in the Promotion will be possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us replace it before we got difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size another.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start knob as a symbol. by using green (green, usually as useless, stiff, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; Start one day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">Upon the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this will take place via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text box there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the apply button and continue it with other tags, so there are still what there or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; supplement functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared this to a better overview through some separators in multiple groups. open the toolbar to adjust dialogue about settings of the toolbar. make sure the toolbar desired.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (on the left side) for my work product. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to get a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my work-equal, could believe that the & konqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button is.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested through probieren of all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be implant folder, but your toolbar should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust their toolbar (n) if a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Maybe the most notable extension of & quantaplus; add to the normal user is the opportunity to like documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create one & PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; check the Repository whether someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you have to search an existing documentation for the formats / script / etc. then you have to create the docrc file. we have to leave the first part we treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relative to this file, # Sec2.3, # Sec2.3, # Secversion 1 = functer 2 = func1, tag1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP, documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2. PHP 3.0], # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Pay attention to the # and Language Reference. this indicates that there are subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for chess telephones (except the reason) mdash, but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the content directory is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on the top of the construction of construction & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Blanks affect nothing, but watch out and lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of the docrc file which is intended to display in context sensitive to context. for example, when writing a & PHP; script running the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array _ function, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the contextlist (ContextList) and the file-linking.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of co-defined context elements which are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and worth are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the comparting resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places we will send an e-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in templates, and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users will be checking and only available when our team needs them as accurate and beneficial for publication. to make a useful contribution, we recommend using resources to be a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources will be guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">By uploading, you are asked for their special GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored) or in the event that you have multiple keys you may need to find out. in the dialogue New resource needs to be completed (URL preview can be empty) and by clicking on OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can upload from the menus DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload, toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in Template and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature. in case of problems, it may be taken into consideration. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML-languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it is possible to work by adding a DTEP package. it gives the simplest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionszeile: the string, die im! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd may appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantaplus; following the conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to take full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one has to bring to them precisely these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit to them.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; it is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for everyone, the & quantaplus; utilizes, available. from materials such as global indicates, stored in the joint folder structure of & quantaplus;. this allows the group of administrators to secure different materials, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of webdevelopers for a single user. they are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a certain project. this can be all done by & CSS; methods up to toolbar with special actions, especially for the files of a particular project. simply stated, this is the most limited size. all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns from all staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the screen window, the construction insight, the cardboard, with info and the toolbar. please propose and for further information about these fields.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the map with the right mouse button to get a contend menu with the current document immediately, such as close the current, other or all cardboard, reloading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarks or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click menu in the editing area lead to another context menu regarding the edited Documentation, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), processing of under the mouse-cursor, or aperture the file, if the string under the mouse-line is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editors are the toolbar. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional can be shown as default, for which a set of toolbar will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, such as & lt; then click the symbol which represents the tag on. well, you can insert the data for this just added day. if you wish to insert the data for this just added day, you should insert a day that has multiple attribute (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog separate fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The builders (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information & quantaplus; to navigate them and enrollers. in the presentation with cartels are available for files, project, pattern, scripts, scripts, scripts and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantitative concept. this view displays all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project through right mouse click. actions such as add, removal, uploading, or deleting the files from the storage medium can be performed with the right-click menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another way of VERquantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what purpose they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global Templates are always available, local codes only available for the appropriate users and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right button, you can access the available information about a script, such as the script should start, edit or send your mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one indicates the internal structure of the active document. by links-clicking on the element's position, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-clicking a elementary propositions it opens a list of commands with regard to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other construction views. with it, manifying attributes and namespaces may change the change of all available attributes with few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development to find. it can be previewed documentation for & quantaplus; 'Documentation site can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added, edited and looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the bottom of the window, can be reached on the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map reveals information about each in the Quanta's current script. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes available to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map reveals all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts, which are executed, give all error messages (so there is) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbar are being extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the toolbar side of the toolbar is the ability to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compression Tar-archive on & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an EMail, they can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; you want to adjust the files to your system. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. options are easy to understand and here not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble downloading & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 I folder. also you should ensure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE-surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a swift web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; the editor began to create the developers of & quantaplus; a stubborn Markup languages would go? well, this would make him an absolutely greatness web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure and HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then the appropriate & IDE should be; for that.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above mentioned claim must be noted, that & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why developers, which has already developed anyone else? thanks to the & kde; -affold is not only this possible but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables WebDevelopers to increase productivity with a intuitive and powerful multi-document (MDI;). this can expand productivity almost every task. by the program complements it is possible to remember the program of compelling them & quantaplus; expand without getting to remember a scripting language tax. (more information about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast design development and quickly expanded to an enhanced editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers made the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More into the details of the documentation is with help: / quantitative (either this URL to & konqueror; input, or khelpcenter help: / quantitative a run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and served by Eric Laffoon sequencer @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located, whereby the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look into the paragraph about templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project file folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Convert at paste from the clipboard there, special character to the & HTML; - Prescription, allowing them to be displayed correctly and not by the browser as a formatting guide.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; which is the correct way to paste special characters and blanks in & URL; s. first, foremost to paste & URL; s in the anchor-day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Divides the blockselection to or out. this allows you to select text blocks using the help of the & Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Move directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Looks a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window up or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Curing and turn of the problem regulator at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem solporter will be activated once you change to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbolism left of the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are reading characters in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or nights, depending on the position of the Cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents will be grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file turn .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to paste files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory according to new files that could be there. this allows, e.g. graphics files to your project folder or subfolders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more on / output emount (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in Chapter & quantaplus; projects can be explained by the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads of the project toolbar. these are stored in Project-box / toolbar and are only available in this menu when you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or Project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by means of settings actions... or you will be asked when you are asked if you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removed a toolbar from the point of view. that deletes they not from the disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the toolbar in the next release is present). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of materials on the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; that you or anything else has done and convert into that & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / auffeur of the entities from the & DTD;. is useful when the abnormalities from the & DTEP are to renew, without renew the entire & DTEP; if this is global and is not present a bundle in the global KDE folder, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags, which are present in the currently loaded toolbar, there is in tags menu a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day dialog dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the smart head of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the items listed below. click on. click on an active plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chose the syntaxing mode for the current file. the list of available lighting schemata depends on the fates; -version ab.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choosing the type of tick-identifier. very useful when you know people, use other OS platforms to wrap. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; load by means of external application.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. through some restrictions in the KDE libraries can cause changing times or cause unnice graphics. recommended, the cardboard box, which is also default, or the subwindow mode, which is the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides for each open subwindow to an entry. with a selection of an entry, the appropriate subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switched the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window gsters, or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue include any application that use the KHTML-Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Targets the behavior of the Editwindow. in the documentation of & Kate, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which can change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and free, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project by filling the entire directory-structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project project characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to give, for example foo. when entering the name file is automatically filled out.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, she has saved the name of the project in small case and with no space with enlargement webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server address of the machine, which you want to access, except you may use local data. either a name (hostname.exemp.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets you be empty this field, the standard settings of the selected protocols may be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adaptation might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">That is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a joint collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default netbars. if a joint collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webcontent you want to download and change. with server-page scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Compact enact when files that are located somewhere in the main folders from the project. if a project is newly started again, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders within the main folder, and you can make a precise selection of your liking.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by anhook or, by removal of the hooks, cling out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings may be uploaded in the menu with Project-Properties in the box window profiles in the basement window, or with the key Shift; F7 Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. additional items will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (placeholder is possible), which can be reclassified in project-related operations like Project ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded when opening the project. in addition, more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This can be selected by the required debugger. at present, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the button options. in case the error is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles uploading uploading profiles (see in) be set, as well as the display of a construction view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing an own construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow configuration, project members can be added, edit or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the window configuration configuration, one can insert action-actions and add these actions, edit or delete. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see into the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior can currently not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be automatically stored. you are asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project-view-view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behaviour also, however, are missing the entries opening and opening with... in the right button of access to the right button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can find different profiles. the profile contains information about the site of upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only more a profile is present, the button is canceled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the energy storage and forget for programming. this option is useful when choosing files needed and the more unsecure password on the plate is not saved into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog until you change your mind from the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many uploading profiles can be compiled and thus the project (or parts of the project) are uploaded to various servers. when working or creating a profile will be shown on this dialog:</seg>

<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be in a project many views, i.e. by simply tick the view, various files and materials can be loaded and replace the current open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible or deleted from the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with whom to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of & quantaplus; to his own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are the toolbar in & quantaplus; best covers the toolbar menu. usage and execution differ. the addition of toolbar is handled at the bottom in the section of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols may be set to remove a new toolbar with new action (right-click on the toolbar), and can remove other promotions as a toolbar, which can be specified in dialogue, where actions can be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additional entries will be removed and action have been edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings of toolbar... and settings actions can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentative, code sclets and files to link. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common file system with expansive organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or each at the system existing directory in the deposits. Templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of each template carried out carefully before using.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary styles are usually included in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in preference under global templates. further information on templates tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special scaffold documents are created in appropriate subfolders. it makes a simple scaffold for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate ways to be efficiently. some examples can be found in preference under global templates. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is inserted based on a template, but the same text area is again inserted in the documents. you can find everything, from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are available in preference under global templates. see for more information on templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, serve these templates for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure, together in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select file as a template save as a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look in the pre-storage room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Now as a template to save the selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the choice can simply be drawn with pulling and junctions to the construction of the template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file into a file folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and distributing, or inserting about the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">One can click in the file tree or in the project files of window manpower to a folder on the right and secure site template, a name for the template and backup. by default in the project folder, but of course, it can be saved as local or a global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented preview. you can insert headlines and peers or dynamic with & PHP; in addition, you can insert some things when using templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The substructure structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in the $KDEDIR / share / text / quantitative and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantitative a / vendor. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of tank, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder, in order to click with the right mouse button, click on the folder and select in the context menu characteristics. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or Templates. this selection is canceled as soon as elterous attributes have been planted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is by default and fit for everything except the stem folders in the pre-page overview. if a stem ordner would generally disabling, unless they are explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text construction. if nothing appears, one is probably in a trunk.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Permits previous or put text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or feet for all templates for a specific project and enables copying contents into a folder with special headlines / track-lines a whole presentation already using the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the right-click menu (show the right mouse button) on a full command collection for the addition of folders or copy and insert from templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; & HTML-Editor, which are accessible via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor through the VPL; -Editor and the ZATION divide the editing window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; - page and a cursor. then you can edit it and when needed for the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor in a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; -Editor. to edit & PHP; in order to edit & PHP; furthermore, the source code is necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time, the modifications are visible in the source code editor and in VPL; -Editor synchronously enabled, this mode is already active, the keypress lists the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation process between the VPL; -Editor and the source code is adjustable via settings Quanta; -view can be adjusted between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in the selection, you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in addition, the recommendation applies: a small margin for quick machine and a large spanish for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose the title of the website, so the processing of unvisible tags at work with the VPL; -Editor will also be called once a new document with the VPL; -Editor will also be created. it serves the decreasing of the final code. thus, you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags meet the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. key words for internet search engines. meta-items can be added below or removed by pressures of the contents, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keynote 2 on the page column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way of designing the look of pages on the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons under the list. a change on the list is possible as with the meta-elements. editing CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style subfolder by selecting the file-opening button and choose the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the Cursors is as described in a text processing, by referring to the arrows, possible. in rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and cleared by means of depressing or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it is to note that the inserting of tags previously mentioned already existing ones tags, e.g. if an anchor-day, is inserted with text, everyone has to removes the surrounding anchor-day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will later be installed in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbar must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to the comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributory many changes made and simultaneously in many places the classification have been corrected; another programmer had altered much text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps just the re-change had changed. that's how this changes occurred a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; it could represent differences within a row and changes to white characters. later, a lot more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare quick text for example, just copy it into the clipboard and add it into one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons, and contracted by folders. this function turned & kdiff3; nearly to a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-ways together are fully supported. this is useful when two people are working independently of each other on a piece of costing and make changes. the original file (the base) helps solve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result expected outcome. in this editor you can even edit the result even directly. the screenshot displays three Quell files combined:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with comparisons and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; execute the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and prescries the possibilities of hypocritic. if you have often check Kode, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and spulsifiers are shown visible. if the lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see a look at the summary in the column at the left side. (no hassle more when someone and the reverse is changing.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red colour means that both differ files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make your typing work only by writing the file name from the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Alberner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 Ordner1 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening-dialog allows the manual typing of filenames when selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the open list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons is selected, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to set a output file. you can do this step later by the storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialogue with settings. here you can set options before you start with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text compare. the comparison starts then immediately. in the opening-dialog you need to select no files you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and distributing: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let him fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar features. if you like to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would have to load just two corresponding files, they into & kdiff3; load and then compare them. now you can copy the relevant sections simply, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you are not able to draw anything from & kdiff3; just draw. only the falling apart from text into a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret and insert text into another program as trigger and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the information line contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional. (if the path is to a file long, leave the mouse a while over the line. then a small utility window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the preset color is Red. (colour for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (together).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the association column. if differences were found, the color indicates the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g, white signs is relevant only in character and comments, for preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which points the summarizing column from the text, is interrupted on the places where the particular source file has no lines. if the column is enabled, the line is dotted on the line lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result page (under the comparative stars) also has an info line with the wording issue:, the filename and [changed] when you have dealt with the result. usually, it includes the automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the storing is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the stem solved / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative stars be used, each contrast can also be resolved at the same time a conflict which must be manually solved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group's group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also be a jump of position in the windows, where the group would otherwise disagree with the color background color for the current range and on the left appears a black beams.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through auto merging or by manual machining no more line will be left in the group; then it is only a space for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again select a different source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a markings that you might copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; assembling concerts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result list. go carefully with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the sources the options do not ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments may also be treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This navigates mainly with the scroll-runs and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using one of the window, you can use the arrow buttons right, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl end, siw how you can also use it by other programs. the overlook column next to the vertical picture bar can be used by clicking on the Navigieren Sie.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augefefenster you can also use the other buttons for working. with the inserting button you can switch between insertion and transcription mode. (preset is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as mentioned in the section and explains the editable output file).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / advance difference (Ctrl below / Ctrl-top), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image downwards) or to the next / unsolved conflict (Ctrl image downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image downwards) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, must be distinguished between soldered and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings in the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is automatically deleted, whatever you mark, automatically entered into the clipboard and the manual Copy disk. be careful with this option but carefully as you could not rewrite the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix-versions use a fuss-sign\, and Win32-based systems use wagenübersicht + Zeilenvorschub\\ r\. KDiffuser does not keep track of the source files so that's why you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the recently used files will be automatically saved, and will be restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 set...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, dialogue also displays scripts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in recursive script are represented. if the chosen script does not support this representation does not happen at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">In systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be represented later. on these systems the button presets will automatically create an unmodified color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the pressures of the tabulator button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tabulator is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press the input or return, the entry of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically copy to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard expires then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type type you prefer to save. the voicing value is the generally common selection of the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">While comparing files tries & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step allows white signs to be ignored. the second step is not ignored each line. in this step white signs will not be ignored. also in the white signs, white signs will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some Editoren (on some systems) save a car sign '\' at the end of a row, but then they could be activated with different sizes on the side-side comparison, but then they could be activated with different sizes on the side-side comparison, however like a white character. during which, this option must be deactivated. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In preference, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the result the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In preference, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively searching for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effectively with complicated and large files, but slowly with very big files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic transmission mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is shown before the next unresolved conflict will be proceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solve automatically all conflicts in white character by using the chosen file as a source. (preset is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files need to be less important. if you only use this from time to time, then use the automatic choice also conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignore or ignorance C / C + + -Comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on Scannen von folders and lead to a merger. look for details under the documentation for directory comparison and conduction.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appalled. if already a such backupfile is appended with the Suffix .orulator, this will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program. you need to stop and restart that the change will be active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set up globally via the control center).</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following codes can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the above setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection fields for coding a brief reference, which is a brief reference, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpret. as coding for each file is adjustable individually, even files can be compared and combined with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding for storing should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define the processing command, you might not work with your codec. (e.g., your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the coding of the output of prep command folders.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to press the highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or overviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options do not ignore or Ignoriere C / C + + -Comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are shown. however, sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is shown next to the normal nor a second overlap column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. you can easily use the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparative side by side or side to each other. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together. a simple click starts the merger and uses the filenames of the last source file as voicing names for output file. (if this function is used to reboot that, then the name of the most recently used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that meets the exact requirements. you can use this function for example to cut out-out parts or to correct the setup.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is given first to this external command (see above), then the output of the instruction will be given only at the line-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your own CPU, which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line has to have an associated output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is however, that in most cases cursed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preamp command for loading in large letters: sed's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ '. * is a ergative expression of the text displayed on each string and in this connection, the\\ 1 is based on each string text. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other Versioncontrol systems use some keywords within the same pattern of $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you might even think that regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignoring of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiffuse.sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'any sign between' and ']' is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing but almost erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several deposits at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also use something different such as perl-. perl -p -p 's / REGEXP / Replacement / switches' allergies are required at perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for viewing and related. the further operations only change the data that the Zeilenabbi-algorythm appears.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The precessor commands are very useful, but as with any feature, the text is altered or differences, you may fail to notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers are going to edit in a folder a lot of files. for this reason you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the simulate and shows the simulated changes without it truly perform,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions with either all (F7 button), or only with selected objects (F6 button),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is the comparative and computing of individual files to be very similar. you only need to open a folder on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three Folder will be assembled, folder 1 is used as base. if no target file was specified, used & kdiff3; Ordner3 as target-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start working together, you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F7 button. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform a small message window on the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which are compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scantool is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder in the scan was found, is shown here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object, or by clicking on the arrows icon all subdirectories from subdirectories, and all subdirectories that you can fold or clap all subdirectories.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file size will be started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column Name reflects the datatype in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the filatype is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the connections will not be selected automatically. if this will run together, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above image, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the colour is also identical, although the age of the items is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered as identical if your whole content is identical. then, the folder also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant to its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leafy that is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C not have the same data type (for example, if a folder and B file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started together.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same data type (for example, if a folder and B file): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started together.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target were specified and if the option directories are synchronize. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action in order to make the both folder identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical are: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible filename for the output file only B; directly after the composite, copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folder will be combined and select the new file instead of going on (unsafe) then examining & kdiff3; the exact date is identical... files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the file cannot be started together.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While cooperating, one file will be processed after the other. you state-column signifies if the result was successful, and accordingly other messages, if something disnexpected. if that's come together, you should check a final review and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the dialog dialog, the file method is selected, K.COM is displayed more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will only appear when three folders compared or combined.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either have the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries have selected at once. if you have selected all the one-clock actions (even in all subfolders) you can perform that together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a Target folder, then in the three folder mode, C as a destination is used, with a two-folder, B as a destination is chosen and synchronise the A and / or B as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries will be displayed in the target structure, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options to be covered by certain entries. check these options to avoid unloving surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To make all the entries together: select directories / continue in the directory -menu or press F7 (the keyboard). in order to make the current entry / select action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to contradictory data types still exist invalid actions exist, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, will appear a combative window with the options circulating, simulate and abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulation, if you would like to see what would happen without the really changes you'll get. you will receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual intrusion is necessary (computing a single file), then you will open an open window (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again directories, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialogue will be. then leads & kdiff3; continued work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; click on a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll be able to try out the cause of the problem. if you choose to relocate the cause of the problem, or to skip the problem of the problem. thus, you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any way before you continue to merge with.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually assembled, notes & kdiff3; these items (in the current session) and leads them later related to all entries. even if this has been related or not recorded, these entries will be considered settled. only if you change the merge promotion, these entries will again be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDef3 set...) now has a section called directory interaction with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files fit to the specified pattern will appear in the elementary tree. there are multiple pattern to be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid space: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). folder you must not correspond to that pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to that pattern, are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to that pattern, are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the Semikolon; as separator. valid space: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder with a .cvsignore file can be set. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystem files, files have a default attribute. a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary file or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If left on files: if the option is switched, symbolic shortcuts are compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which links show. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched, the links like normal folder will be treated and recursively perately. (note that a link to a folder of a link on itself would result in a power loop and refuse off.) This option is not switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file by and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower if they are applied to files that does not contain any text (give an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare large folder via a slow network, it may be faster, only the amendment date and file size. however, this speed requires a degree of security. please use caution. this option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly as confidential to the amendment date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if when copying the amendment date. please use caution. this option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronise mode when two folders are compared and no target section are specified. in this mode, the suggestions are made to the assemble. also the results of the merge files are stored in both folders. this option is placed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered as uncertain as it is provided that the other file is not also changed. you should consider this in any case.) This option is placed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">When a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted, then the original version will be renamed and receives the extension .orig. if an old backup file with the .orc extension already exists, then this will also process the normal assembling of individual files, not only the associated whole file. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder's diversion stays visible; you can move the window pone with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the option directory & text window in the window -menu and switch between directory & text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, you can create a single file directly, without the folder you launch, the status will be completed on finished and the file will not be brought together once you launch the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost if you read the directory again: directory -menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparenz with the help of KIO-Slaves. KDiffuser uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a ftp-server. the second command line compares a folder in a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. some things should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, Leeres &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the used protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then, one file will be accepted as a link objective. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit authorization or modification date. therefore, the authorization or modification date from original. (note the option confidential of size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reference purpose is currently known as the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop first always starts the built-in differences in KDevelop. by means of KZ3, press the right mouse button on the differences-viewers, and then select in KDiff3Part, dating back to the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually, & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as the default file, taking a patch file in Unified format. then entails & kdiff3; the names of original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the conqueror you can select on a patch-file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiffuser. please note that this does not work when none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable when the original files since the patch of the patch.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the same or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the module mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now Heist es Kompare) there is already. besides, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can be combined like the program diffuse 3 from the Diff-Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL-programs very long and have learned a lot by running into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or go to this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and are not communicated to the correct prefix to KDE. in the default case, configure / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are considered as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is not identical to each other, if similar lines are the next to each other, this may be, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor keeps for every difference in the files he begins and where it ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file, which could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large until now. you can restore a certain version through selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src lints; released and the text cannot be extinguished. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to distinguish from differences. even more bloodhooting would be confusing and lack the purpose. do not use any other editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubleshores came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdiff3; take advantage of, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of latest changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. nevertheless, difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl-X or reverse-removal) copies the marked text. paste (Ctrl-V or Extensions) adds the text from the clipboard at the current Cursorposition or replacing the current markings.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences appear: files all identical in all folders appear not appear in the folder structure, and consequently also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you must read following changes to these options the folder with the function Refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">It will only appear to display the differences. this also leads to that identical files will not be copied into the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain, they are likely to have changed after that. (the behaviour will be cancelled later in a later program version) This option is not switched in the default size.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the signboard A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are on one of the buttons, the lines are appended from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the result pages (if the lines are already present, they will be relocated at the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In preference, this option is deactivated. the differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') will be treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a mini-show of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the ongoing programs on the desktop surfaces, to change their size, to finish them or to postpone it. this works both inside a desktop and at several times.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; display all virtual desktops as well as those running on current applications. applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager, then click on an application within & kpager; however, the context of the application and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimize, maximize space and ending. the commands make the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only if you clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only if you click on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">Is this attracting field marked, you can move window within the & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">To cross this field passes the & kpager; the numbers of virtual desktops. it is indicated with the name indicated, the names with ordiners will provide, and eg; 1st working space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also shown as the background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the ongoing programs are shown as small windows in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. a symbol shows the windows with its default symbol and Pixmap. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; controls are determined: classically-known as from pager applications in some other Windowss; waagrees shows all virtual desktops in a waist and vertical in a vertical series on what is very good for viewing on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager-Miniprogram in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click on the right button of mouse button, and then select the switch between switch... lets the dialog adjustments appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment, this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. but you can do this manually:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated a mouse click on the same point. it is meant to help people who suffer from the replicitive penalties in the jury (RSI) syndrome and each of each single mouse-click pain. this, however, it requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that is created by clicking the mouse and helps to use so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you suffer because of the mere reference to the mouse. unfortunately, you suffer pains that are related to the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to get it even clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by referring to the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic assistants, the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse click once you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent moving activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after being executed using the mouse button. move the mouse until the end of the mouse button. in this way you can run the pulling with oppressing mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This slow-time must be ridden down after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click on.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smarter switched on, the rotating season is active (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the descent of the mouse button is waiting until it leaves the mouse button again, if by the meantime no account has been done by the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the Click-shift service. this feature is enabled, creates a slow search for right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt; the first time started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction times; then click Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider Allgemein. there is a slider sound-buffer, which you adjust to a lower value to shorten the answers.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Once this setting is marked, & kmousetool; Start & kmousetool; this function is currently only under & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please refer to the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All settings returns on the values that were shut when opening the dialogue. have you already pressed the button, the settings will be applied to the state after the last drummer.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best to use & kmousetool; first of all using the presets. especially the intelligent moving you should start off at first. if you then click into the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may necessary to reduce the responses of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: the clicking on the neutrality components of windows and in places in the browser window that do not represent a link, does not lead to unlimited reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is ruckelt, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you can not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball in touch.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. like that happens, from mouse to mouse differently. it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole, in which the ball has been used. the dirt and soiling can easily be scratched with a flat blade or the trapernagel scratching.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system collapsing the execution of & kmousetool; if you use just an accident, it means that & kmousetool means that the surgery can no longer end through the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use one other window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. this is the status of & kmousetool; return and you can proceed as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you input text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and thereby putting the cursor to another point.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor from where you want to have it. however, a conversation on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to call it out. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit them.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy text to copy it into the clipboard and move again or any other action, where you want to move your mouse at the pressing mouse button. however, some advice will probably be ready for them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart lockout not when you are just starting to start & kmousetool; to use text instead, perform at an end of the text area a mouse click and hold down the reverse button, while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and then once again move the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this becomes every time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when the smart move begins at the beginning. later you can use the smart lockout even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the XTest-extension for & X Window. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and are furnished correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressing the mouse button once the mouse-cursor is short persevered. this program has been designed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and those who are hurt those of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; also, can be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pull-out process begins before the mouse button is released. in this way, the pulling can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2621">In Filtering, text is processed, before going to the program Speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, or to avoid a suitable language and speakers, or to handle certain shortcomings of language synthetics and their votes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is withdrawn to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the remaining orders will resume.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & win; processor is to be hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message collapses normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you see & win; a long text on a website read, you can see with & kmouth; someone who just enter the room. & knot; -notices are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order that you encounter from the map card contracts is a text contract. KSayit is an example of applications that are used by text applications, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four of the order cards are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen saaders. if an application sends the output of a screen saaders, during & ktts; just such pre-read, this issue will be raised and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and yields as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are running as modules. in the future it can be still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String-string replace parts of a text by other text. the set-up parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions; the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) is made by text or for the formatting of messages & conversation; or e-mail; to a better understanding.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformer use a XSLT-File (XML; Style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from a format to transmute the translation of & XHTML; include some XSLT files to the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker chooses, you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program you send the text on & ktts; if you have set the text on the map-card orator a female voice, you can read text from KDE news about it. Siehy. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these various filters has envisioned rules, according to which he is applied for voice transmission. if the filter does not apply, that its rules are not accurate, he keeps the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a notification, warning or a message; sent by all the activated filter that is set up on the page below. the processing of the filters usually takes place in the order in the list from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of standard normal filters. a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filter are processed as a row after downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filfilter, and it will display the characters below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the set of character files, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns. these patterns will be found in the text, then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type your filter a name. those names can choose any number, it just needs to distinguish by the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the character in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string of the column. the list will be processed in the indicated order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Using these buttons, you can load or delete a list of words or regular expressions from a file you can store or delete a list from a file, the entries file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Here is a language registered here, the filter is only applied, if the spokesman speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. you can also select multiple languages if you click at the mouse click the & Ctrl; button pushed down.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Here is a value entered, the filter is used only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: Konation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The Application ID plender programs will get you with the program qdbus; the number you need is weave. if for example & qdbus; the Udungs-ID Kopete-3432 indicates, you may only enter Kopete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The drawing filter filter will only be applied to the text, if all conditions can be used with an entry in the box Diesen Filter, if all input cells is empty, the filter is applied to all the texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the drawing filter terms in the form\\ s word\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by partitions (space).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; terms & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs or add-work as help to meeting these expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; expressions & # 160; expressions can be found in the kdeutils package.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is achievable via the environment variable PATH, it reaches xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker Electoral filter, you can send text to a specific speaker which is installed on the map-card orator, or to a spokesman with certain properties. you can specify for example that texts should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text indicates the filter there is a spokesman for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker's properties, which sends the text on & ktts, and the properties of the speakers selected by speakers. with the Speaker editor allows you to write the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Here is a value entered, the filter is used when the text contains the ingiven regular expression. it is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; terms, you can call this with one click on the button starting to obtain help with the input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, d. h., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you define the properties of the desired speakers. if the text meets the above filter terms, the speaker is selected to indicate the desired requirements most frequently. click on the button on the right to indicate the dialog's choice.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons, to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker filter will only be applied to the text, if all conditions apply with an entry in the box of Diesen. you must register at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice control, the talk speed, the volume, the sex of voice and pitch. furthermore, marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partly and only in basic functions. the following limitations are present:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Ra _ diphone voice (british male) because this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tape at the Festival Configuration is not installed on 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and typing filter filters (SDB filter). SBDs are subject to synthesized text in individual sentences. this means that you can also synthesize the whole phrase, not the whole text order. so you can also drop down or stop down and abort, even though the language synthesizer this does not directly support.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the rules of the proposition. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as preceding a propositional filter filter, you can change its settings or add any other statute filter to beginners, but will not get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the simplest you learn the arrangement of language selection by trying out. turn off the Speaker selection, you choose some features and check how the selection of the microphone is changing. of course you have to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with the read can start since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the entire text block, which can take very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You may then keep orders on the map card or interrupting, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal propositional filter parameters will be automatically set up if you start the measurement-gr for the first time. it cannot be switched, just removed. change nothing at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional filters compare text with a regular expression for statutes and add a tablature sign (decimal characters are automatically removed from the text). please note that the default value of the default filter is included.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied on & kde; -news (rewind), warnings, news, or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from verse the normal propositions filter, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map module, you can write the speakers for the application. the map card is shown, if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the map (speakers). in other words, there are no Sprecherproperties specified.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Highlight this checker if the property should have priority prior to other properties. you can also set a number of markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue is, it will always use as a priority property. it is the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute, if you know that a particular application has been written text in another language than that in the work environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the range speakers, to clear the following hereinafter, click on the selection of the standard speakers and then use on speaker at the most indicated below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is available for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a order number (no order number is the input 0 required).</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kickcenter, which allows the management of netinterface, routing and DNA settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontacentre; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop constellations via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontacentre; can be called by selecting K Menu kContacentre.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, such as other settings from the & kcontactconf; create the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installing a new module network settings in the & kickcenter; displays the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting from kickcenter; internet & network network settings in the & kmenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that &-networkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers have already been functioning and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device itself shows and the adjustment of the network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the Install of & Linux; and installed network devices later, the driver must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the core version, be loaded:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded, when the option interface settings in the & kickcenter; -index selected is selected. when starting the module network, this one is trying to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the suspension selection is offered. it is the platform from the list that the distribution and release date is best suited. by marking the setting non-once questions the setting will be made permanent. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically presbiased.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The changes in network settings are possible only in system management mode. previously, all the options are obvious, which means, the settings may only be considered, the changement mode is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can enter by clicking the button system mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interface is to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the rider network sections, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Select network interface can be arranged by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface... to be edited in dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button below, displays the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatic the TCP / IP settings are done by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings is required for the system simultaneously with the start of the system services. therefore, the DHCP- or BOOTP server is required. in the selection list can be selected either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection of manual can be specified without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field Network masmask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">Once this setting is marked, the system initializes the system interface with boats. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device box.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off on request. turn off of an posted network you can activate by selecting from the list and click on interface...</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support is replacing a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only be understood as IP addresses. if the computer http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will redeem this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The machine to naming part of the equestrian naming solution enables a simple management of this list. entries may be added, removes or changed wer.DNS entries can be sorted by selecting an entry and execution or degrading in the list with the buttons, or are ordered in the priority.</seg>

<seg id="2830">It may be one of the following tasks to run then with clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module process settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of the binary distribution (usually rpm packages) is sufficient when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively you can use a tool with graphic interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice, but additionally the development of the development of libraries and other libraries are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile. the following commands should achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic networks will be given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP-networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PCs is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP-networks are being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found big spread. IPv6 is expected that it is going through in the near future. this description focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the understanding of which IP address is attributable to a network interface. in foreign networks, on the bench; the workplace is the contact person, which uses a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When adding a private little (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for this purpose reserved to avoid IP address reports with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore, its arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually placed on 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some adresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the Zwidth the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP routing.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The netaddress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP-traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so that it is not surprised if in case of active DSL links, there is another content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand as expected, therefore can happen.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be involved by & kdat; it can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat; spake the band back and reads the pre-voltage information of the belt. realises & kdat; the preliminary on the band will not be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the prechann, searches for the suitable index on your record. can this not be found, you will be asked if the bandname is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the belt works, in order to indicate that the band has been incorporated. in the status bar appears a corresponding message. the contents of the belt can now be searched by out of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before the design of the belt, the inclusion must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "there is a change to the symbol of symbols for the band that the inclusion of the band is solved, and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without any danger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a volume of & kdat; to be used it must be run by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you need to be used to save the data. this procedure does not have to be formatted to the formatting of the user, it must happen before you can be formatted by the band of & kdat; formatted it is usually a formatting of the Bander, DAT-drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the belt. all the data on the tape will be lost automatically! after completion of the format, the band is automatically integrated and is fully operational.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the secure files you need. this can happen on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in a local file tree. it is only stored this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in a tree. it only lists the files specified in the profile.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindexfile using the bandcontents. this process clears all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently marked files and the standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be made. the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to your selected work folders automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files which are listed under backup files, is considered that only the files are stored on the same file system, like the folder. folder, which are on other filesystem, you can enter separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files have since changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files fails; and lt; files were not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings by selecting the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the bandwagon (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-recurring variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & soldier; before the band is integrated load the command mt from the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing instruments can be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. in addition, & kspot log; experienced users the quick access to information about problems that may occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users to understand what your machine is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can provide quick access to information on issues related to their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions provide, with their help the protocol files of certain programs are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful functions. this includes a number of useful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, using their help the single protocol lines of a protocol file is easy to filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting & ksvlog: first, you have tried to open the most important protocol on the system - the system protocol. if you have not shown this, and it opens, instead, you have a small disk window, so you don't have to find the protocol. the protocol files usually find under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user, usually no justification to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion. to display a string into the filter bar. in the default setting, the selection field will be displayed, next to the filter entry. then, a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns contain the string string of the filter server.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. the string of the filter template will then select only with the entries in the corresponding column. select the column process in the filter bar, thus displays you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the key protocol lines. protocol lines of step errors are shown with a conspicuous color as protocol-lines of step indication. the colored presentation of log lines can be switched in dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to see only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can choose the process identification (PID) in column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window, to show all the new record lines displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub-window and once you have selected a subwindow, select the menu a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has an own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further recent information on the supply sources of & ksvlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: kszentlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as & ksysv; this section holds a few concepts, and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V init quickly developed to the standard for the control of the program starts at the top of the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful and also more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init system.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file lies under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to make a machine on System V init, without a reinstall and re-format. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that is the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead right in / etc. this folder is rc.d. however, you will find rc.sysinit and following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail; httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as settee, which only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should sit down upon / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even though there is not much use for it. you can also run a rc.string in / etc / rc.d if you want to run out something to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for different places according to the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line as the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to edit it, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and edit the 3. if you have a little converse, then you will fix it by resting the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts? if you input l -l in rc3.d, you probably will see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How do and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written that there is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this script from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name and when the one includes, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level, which can only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user-level level, which is & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not be trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move between Runleveln or alter the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the range of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you simply drag them to a new level. to copy them on a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copying from the menu edit or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The type of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the box numbers of the surrounding items before you can once again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to reproduce entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) and the Cursor buttons to make a selection of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runoff, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired Runlevel with paste (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow drummer or the name of an item manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. include the dialog by erneous glands of entering the button to accept the changes, or press Esc to design the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of the amount of data, all entries in the menu file call a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel on a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have made some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE, or Delix (DLD) then you have to edit additional files in / etc. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way how system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are required (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; the running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save this. either you use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or the entry store in the File.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two box-cards, user interface and username. to edit the desired users or the desired group with a double-clicking on the entry. it appears in the dialog user or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are displayed only if you have enabled extra-settings (Quota) for users, will make a map card available to which you can make individual settings. other cards appear, if Shadow -Passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password appears if Shadow -Passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map will only be activated, if for at least a built-in filesystem grounding (Quota) enabled and initializing (recognizable at the file quotas user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can be modified for each user parameters, using space constraints at each number in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for any filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the array system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map-map Group informs about the group members of the selected user. the default group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the field of the group. furthermore, the user can mark a member in other groups by mark them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's dialog includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or a group, select Add text from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add-button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can add the LILO bootdisk to remove the boat password, remove the time up to the booting of the standard operating system, remove the default operating system, remove, change operating systems, change, change and more.</seg>
