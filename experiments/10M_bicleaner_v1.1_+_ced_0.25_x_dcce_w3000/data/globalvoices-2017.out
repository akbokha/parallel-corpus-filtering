although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have been dancing to American music , American writers read and run its sport .
in fact , this country had a great profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American Film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura @-@ Stud@@ entin who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ates , who wanted to conf@@ ess the Supreme Bundes@@ platz with Rich@@ tern who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like that the absolute truth is , everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting , that you can always be the one who you are , and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very dark@@ ish love of about his size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me as he goes with his Eng@@ dies .
he never stops behind the mountain how to say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as former colleague put it , and openly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , African American and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes which he won at the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections , was the highest number given by the party of nomin@@ ate can@@ did@@ at ever .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ote person , I asked myself ?
I was able to reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and its voters with the people I had learned during my time in Phoenix .
such as my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist , the people from all over the world gather , a deep @-@ believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
also cons@@ ented tr@@ umps world view not by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; fact .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had arrived in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps Int@@ ence is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced during Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits with the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ el helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the through them em@@ bodi@@ ments my love of America .
while wearing his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can Presi@@ dents , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t compared to non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people have voted for wearing because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
maybe it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
to arrange the people , one of my friends , is exactly what led to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities do not take into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of whom are , for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this United States they are still important ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look different with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look differently from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( m@@ t. ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acts of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; word@@ play from black into play on the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones called , has made exactly what America has done so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one can always have , America is everyone .
for this country chose his president , twice the son of Ken@@ y@@ cle , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the choice Donald Tr@@ ump@@ y there is a vast part of the white America of this promise , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in the Americas , after 9 / 11 the white man is again in the ru@@ der , they say .
in all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the amount answered with a strong &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the amount .
&quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ lied them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were calling and their votes have been lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and onom@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump@@ y &apos;s land , said the message .
and all the people who look as Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
that the music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with you ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for some years now La B@@ anda de m@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the church : one of the children and an adult Symph@@ onie orchest@@ ras , which has found a way to overcoming them surrounding them .
a music school with 100 students is central to the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the parish , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ik@@ os , is known for its drugs mis@@ use and banking violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth were thus a rare g@@ limmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet their great passion .
they come and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the excitement you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from MÃ¼l@@ l
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village which lies practically at the greatest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made from re @-@ selling waste material :
music with recur@@ sively instruments that consist of local solid waste material , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez in order to transform parts of the crash into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cu@@ elli , double bass , gu@@ it@@ ars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were produced from the gar@@ bage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article from Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teaches the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the early times :
first it was very difficult , because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o was something that he had never seen before : one out of waste is out .
today there is an entire orchestra , playing on instruments based on instruments and called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
the world creates more than one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and live with him are the poorest - as the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follow the orchestra with his inspiring spectac@@ le of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has played his music before the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can be successful against illegal fishing
photo Â© Copy@@ @-@ i Africa - a project that fights the wild fishing fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported about international , pract@@ ised solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release is done within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common usage of Content .
in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ i@@ an waters of illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore dis@@ led and little pat@@ ched to welcome a legislative bur@@ gl@@ ars of this species on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed itself swi@@ f@@ tly against the ship . they ling@@ ering him one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship &apos;s time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s stocks .
at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices under@@ crossed and resources protects , however @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from the N@@ RO stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ) founded .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries , who had sold the prime minister out of their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project are illegal f@@ ishing . this project provides non @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because of it extremely difficult to absor@@ b . so that &apos;s illegal fishing is a main matter of over@@ fishing regions .
through the int@@ enti@@ onal dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm that a del@@ ik@@ ates balance have .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also through the sn@@ ail with the information between individual countries , so events happen today in real time , with trac@@ eable on the @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one has noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ tion .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea , by means of satellite .
this allows the authorities to mark ships known in forbidden areas . also , such di@@ vul@@ ged bicycles can be discovered - some such that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fish @-@ licence , where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse on the basis of such information then adop@@ ting such ships in their ports . what does the ships do not sell their cargo . and that they could even be forced to pay for pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial loss for the owners , which means the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , executive director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also assi@@ sts &apos;@@ i @-@ i .
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover from 20 million USD in abandoned sales , which will lose eight members of the network of H@@ ISH @-@ i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing , present to the region &apos;s commercial fishing from around the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
their practices such as actions include as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licens@@ ing paper , indication of Phant@@ asi@@ es , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take the weaknesses of a non @-@ sufficient control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ker my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; and this very leg@@ ale cor@@ nerst@@ one tries to close @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , Bre@@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has revealed criminal networks covering the f@@ ake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it fle@@ eing ships tr@@ acked and found .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to combat crime , EU @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us rather far into networks organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system , the FISH @-@ i should help suspected ships of precise sites .
photo with friendly permission of AV@@ @-@ i Africa .
Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , also helps those illegal ships have to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which deals with fish@@ eries data and does &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ i technical support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on their automated identification systems , so that they can no longer be stored by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different information levels with each other . it should help however , discrimin@@ atory ships with greater precision .
a model program
but , Game @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of the position of each individual ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ enting with the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that gives simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to b@@ undle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has allowed a similar project in which a global system allow persecution of ships .
there are signs that age @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but also terri@@ fy them .
boats which previously had without license conf@@ isc@@ ated and hardly to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in the @-@ i @-@ participating countries took a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries policy , since fishing boats more licenses buy .
after having had helped @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 up@@ set , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow , whose use is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of AV@@ @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries do notice this successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an academic object every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there have been six countries joined in 2015 , for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting for illegal fishing , according to the same model as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures emerge also in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently I could report the recent member country Somalia his first big tri@@ umph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the move under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used to@@ wing networks that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also incorporated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen in Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH , this is a further success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

the stre@@ et@@ ations in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of severe demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum as President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government Venezu@@ el@@ ets had rejected the amend@@ ment of the opposition to a referendum held accountable , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans gave their eyes on the political and economic crisis of the country into the country by gathered themselves on the streets .
under the has@@ ht@@ ag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the reverse side ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the flat area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions of MÃ©ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north situated in Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating what makes itself noticeable in everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition seen in the bai@@ li@@ ff of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes place in its latest article the context of the government , as follows :
within the framework of social , political and economic crisis , in which the infl@@ ation@@ ary and ant@@ al@@ tr@@ ate belong to the highest on the world ( infl@@ ation@@ ary ) is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements , and in which a serious lack of food and medicine was considered to con@@ quer the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

on Twitter you will find pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves beat the news about police oppression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there , the protest@@ ers returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed fear of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests were continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators sought to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira carry no tubes , because otherwise you could see something what many nationalities do not have !
meanwhile , an Inf@@ ogra@@ fik is making the scale of repression per day :
this is how the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the requirement for a bank@@ ment procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many , by the presence of countless people on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot;

others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has undertaken a little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather pre@@ di@@ ct critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ean city CÃ³rdoba .
as now an adult man told Qu@@ ij@@ ano as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera in the province of CÃ³rdoba and his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father to carry out to the brutal Mil@@ itÃ¤@@ ro@@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , he watched it in the age of 15 .
for 34 years he kept the family pre@@ occupation for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ be@@ am@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean Military Intelligence between 1974 and 1983 , was his father of stat@@ es@@ de@@ ur of Intelligence 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged on kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ os son , a man who realized over the years the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a Federal Constitu@@ tional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent for his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the sports hall on the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made combat .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo , and urged me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are a no@@ stri@@ l , you made you friends with one of the ERP .
passport only indicates that they will not escape one day and then I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito -@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries Volks@@ ar@@ mee - the military arm of the Revolu@@ tionary Labour Party in Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my Father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ and@@ amat@@ erial , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ da , the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times in La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he took me , to rise . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little wr@@ apped out of wr@@ inkl@@ es and command@@ ed me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on this day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were put down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out on an open space and said :
since they are practic@@ ing the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ying , and saw a couch on which people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and a metal @-@ feathers .
later , I found out that it was attached to it by the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lod@@ ged straight there .
you sel@@ dom do a man with palms to the bed , covered him with water and hunt him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the gest@@ ank there was un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entry of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with hand@@ shake and cle@@ ave .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were standing with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated on the hands and feet .
near the entrance , people still rely on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I looked at the prisoners he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what gu@@ ck@@ st thou so , Ar@@ sch@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I resear@@ ched &quot; Why did you get me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this , because my father told him home away .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there hit a man and sle@@ w .
( according to information from survi@@ vor@@ s of the civil , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former followers of Fol@@ ders .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped here came here .
when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got their number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be imposed .
that was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the wo@@ sion of the people and the dis@@ appearance of her cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war@@ fare &apos;
my dad brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war yield , &quot; as she called it - was .
but when I was later by the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war @-@ be@@ asts are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military ab@@ mark , which one decre@@ ases to an enemy that has been fought .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was a officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penet@@ rate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crime and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you that you get cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cri@@ ed :
if you go so far , I will find you and bring you curious .
this is what we need for nobody else !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I carried a jacket and a sco@@ oter out of w@@ ool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still got clothes with home .
at that time , the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ acy would have been in this crime . I re@@ lu@@ te , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was anyway there to speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , where I am older , I find Reu@@ e .
I have children . if one has only children , you see the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have contacted during the dictatorship of man , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children are kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed .
it was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies disappear ?
were these people not also families who were able to commit their mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were sm@@ elled and somewhere escap@@ es - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als , including my father .
the thought to indicate my father was created during a conversation while he was under house ar@@ rest .
I made him mad because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience .
then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have no one killed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they were sup@@ pos@@ edly defended themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cri@@ ed :
how can you tell me something to me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have horri@@ ble crimes committed and you forced me to participate as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only re@@ lie@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na then forgiveness me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I first saw the first ad .
I had finally realised that he was a crimin@@ als .
no one can pret@@ end to me that I am pres@@ et . I finally came against my own father .

editing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Center in which one can extend its leadership , last month witnesses a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van@@ guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but perhaps also with mal@@ icious backgrounds too &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adapting of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine which was often shared in social media .
the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os , and it was also that drew attention to the local time .
the Kyoto newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henn@@ drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from transl@@ ator and that the translation was not checked for correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt due to the insufficient correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set up a somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; sc@@ ary &quot; was stran@@ ded as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but rather cause for concern .
in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1.8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
so its share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents fall , in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the well @-@ named re@@ por@@ ters brought into the light on the article of the article comments to light which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese would seem to be popular with older drivers :
the article on Yahoo through the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is it ( &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think that is a real translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true discovery for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
to over@@ turn one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in mind language . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the source language - mother language .
thus , a French wom@@ b should be transl@@ ating from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ associates with English as a mother tongue , to translate the translations into English . this may result in error @-@ understanding of the survi@@ ving , cost @-@ reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , to be attributed to Japanese .
some companies , who even have no foreign staff , release translations nevertheless company @-@ internally . then the Japanese worker , whose English skills are considered to be the best for transl@@ ator - regardless of how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the trans@@ lu@@ ous and pu@@ zz@@ ling phr@@ ases caused by machine translation , show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human transl@@ ator for a long time .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling @-@ prints which often decor@@ ate T @-@ Shirts or bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flick@@ r and Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors are acceptable or acceptable , or at least harmless . but of large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translation .
in future the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and announ@@ cements on the internet and television take to
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ensa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7th , reported Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they have no access to the Online @-@ Sender Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the Internet access was accessible from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV as well .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers were also organized by protests in Car@@ acas , organized by opposition groups who would like to oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April , after the vote was dis@@ solved by the parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s duties on the executive and the upper dish itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was sealed , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Z@@ ens@@ ur : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that internet web @-@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ical provider are once again closed .
this is from the side of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers like Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ ti@@ ans with Internet access , mainly in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been in reporting about protests regarding protests . at that time , the Commission for telecommunic@@ ations gave them with money stra@@ ws and lock@@ ings , if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly , that will continue to be cheaper than two lit@@ ers of Lim@@ on@@ ade to buy .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ cin@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible through a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itter . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly passes its sessions .
previous post @-@ research of the Institute for press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider to use DNA . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests of certain domains have failed .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or deny the request when calling for such a website .
we confirm a DNS inter@@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV Kamer@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flores , who was transferred to the protests in Car@@ acas .
Flores was be@@ aten , while he was found in police force .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government regulated the internet connections , so that the Venezu@@ el@@ ans will keep access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current events in the country .
Paraguay will get a lot of girls to slave in Paraguay
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who have been precisely how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ tural .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report of Kur@@ tural , who is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of authors .
the article is part of a series called &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; f@@ ading cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family , who was allowed to eat .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard , as the owner of the house was filled with pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
those who have become something , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . as cri@@ ad@@ ita , one refers to Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ pass its min@@ der@@ son son or her min@@ ig@@ old daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned here is that children must pay for this inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the context of a contract that cannot be raised .
these as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go identified practice is widely used in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and , despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so she spoke with cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - raised witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ced .
she tried to call things on the name , for the sense of gratitude that the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is vacc@@ inated , not to remain silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is the one hand , that her daughter is in faith that they ex@@ clude their education to improve their position in society and make &quot; something out of itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , which pic@@ ks the girl with her and justi@@ fying exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get education and perhaps even more hungry .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mist@@ r@@ ently , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never experienced them .
in January 2016 the hi@@ ther@@ to relatively un@@ known phenomenon , which takes place in the Hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº to hospital , its body showed traces of heavy stri@@ pes . in short , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as official teacher at the entrance of the residents .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ erÃ­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants , situated 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in late January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murder of a child was a cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organisations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the foundations that were deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen company of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest@@ ations together and demanded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier , pun@@ ished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of married and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a high @-@ day investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ ad@@ ita , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before judgment , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark , when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the daily life of a cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas is not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in her age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the bul@@ let in which her father has worked , went bank@@ rupt and lost her father his work .
your brothers had to now all work and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets for earning money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to share the time that you remained also time to learn .
every morning she was waiting for five o &apos;clock in the morning and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
un@@ interrupted for instance , they puri@@ fied the fridge , cleaner the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ crip@@ ts the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was ready with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had not had dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had to hung@@ ered , but got also not bo@@ unded food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books out of the landlord &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembered .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do liberal , a liberal party , which was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings of the hous@@ eholder Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and to find editorial from op@@ positions such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give any belief in the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator of the dict@@ ator .
he thought it was intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who was listening , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they had the opinion that I would be there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; with this they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , at home their mother tongue , Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Mr fears that they had the formation , which they had allowed to lose again , she explained .

the Society endor@@ se the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can browse advertis@@ ements for cleaning personnel and children in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is PE@@ PA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a city district in As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please inform yourselves .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ t@@ ful girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state that would like to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , the editor of the ad turned into an ad once again :
dear friends , I have found a found . I look at once it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was finished .
in pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ ad@@ itas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ ad@@ itas , how long ) ? ) , a collection of stuff say former Cri@@ ad@@ itas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to establish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a business system during the Spanish conquest , in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ador had to be examined and the native population ( with which the worker has had to be seen as semi @-@ slaves ) , that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they will be slight victims of abuse and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social inequality in Paraguay and those facing power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
web @-@ bill writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian authorities have recently agreed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding usage and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by Parliament , users and users need to register social media into Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , a place would then be set up a place that is in@@ ordin@@ ated to give citizens a permit social media .
within six months , with acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register with their correct name and staff numbers in order to use social networks .
if it failed to do so , this might be a punishment of up to six months in prison or a cash register .
the bill , who consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ ob@@ de Application , who runs through the Internet and use it to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when there is no reference to how Egyptian authorities should im@@ pose on user users and users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on stage of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary or@@ derly and promot@@ ers of the legislative template , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received from the telecommunic@@ ations Ministry for a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that Facebook blocked . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to create a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptian and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known so far that such plans stand .
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; guided research @-@ technology &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly believe in technical capacities and the understanding of every authority in Egypt with regard to things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they put it so that just as they could control the dense physical public and private spaces , and could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they permit a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require a permit or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to as@@ sign them to a judicial process .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
to be passed to the law , the draft must first be discussed at the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of parliament and constitutional committees before going into the plenary session .
whether its acceptance and enforcement won &apos;t be successful or not , the design &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military doctr@@ ination in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensures that no so@@ othing nar@@ ration on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Par@@ am@@ orph@@ an T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy proposed a law against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long det@@ ention for those was intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest &quot; protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the northeast of the Iraq , H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq began to protect the spiritual Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leopard , which runs through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of its habitat , and since they are getting less lo@@ ot , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza showing in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard the only remaining beast of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big rob@@ tier is present .
the chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore poses that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera all , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy .
being trained Biolog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate like a different side of their country , which is not just out of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field@@ studies on wild animals living and educational programs from nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , the continued daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made during the past six years to rebuild the lives of those that were affected by the &quot; Trinity disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a vast earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom @-@ accident in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which lies in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a mis@@ pre@@ f@@ ecture of pre@@ f@@ ecture to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbourhood of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced mar@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had van@@ ished whole coastal cities off the map .
again , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , even alone therefore 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved after six years to rebuild the lives of local communities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction agency as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
the residential structure in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ newspaper reported that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( the balance is the one , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate finished .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could award Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima is 70 percent closure .
however , we still strive for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by shel@@ ters ( the individual , the other , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare parts .
after the triple @-@ catastrophe nearly 80 thousand people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such cases .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emer@@ gen@@ cies . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated prices , which after the disaster in Beh@@ al@@ ry accommodation , were converted into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures :
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the bourgeoisie , opened their doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , there is much more difficult industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while nearly 100 percent of the fish@@ eries port in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again , in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing mar@@ inas have res@@ umed its operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have been m@@ ild@@ ed in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agri@@ cultur@@ ally in co @-@ passi@@ on@@ ately .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , only 66 percent of the agricultural land of I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of agricultural land in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima can be used again .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fall , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares was destroyed of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , lying in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered over again , but here Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still remains far down .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , on the other hand , it can only be 75 per cent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also tells that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal community , it is harder to make themselves earn their livel@@ i@@ hood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to obtain a full picture , the newspaper resulted in many question@@ ings among the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated nations . they asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sens@@ ations have changed in relation to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of the respon@@ dents , that still have not been done enough in disasters prevention .
how it comes to those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima
in her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has focused their attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated energies of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had not only had the enormous earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima was also witn@@ essed the worst , cat@@ astroph@@ ism , nuclear accidents , the Japan had ever had to experience .
out of 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated by Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were imposed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 something was more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , in permanent spare parts .
after the state of 2017 there are more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima off their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astroph@@ y areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ation areas are still in Beh@@ el @-@ shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old . they must compete in proper Beh@@ avi@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima with massive building projects . this is building projects , the part of the Olympic Games will take place in Tokyo .
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that more than it appears at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small but very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look carefully these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices that remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa still remin@@ ding the love of music the lack of common language knowledge during a journey in rural China ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brasi@@ lian student at the age of 33 has been delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide , millions of protest@@ ers participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied the social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors carried him this Saturday and now have displ@@ aced him into an artificial Kom@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer to see with a stroke term . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been abandoned by an active service to the conclusion of the incident taken by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his head@@ stock on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police controlled by a protest@@ ers and land on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; , a press channel of media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus from the police are attacked and several sanitary briefly on it .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is also fil@@ med in social networks .
in the shown clip you see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users meanwhile have 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 euro ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is hospital .

Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist was killed in Guil@@ her@@ me Irish by his father because he had attacked the Occup@@ y movement of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , because he was attacked the very sad event of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , since he was attacked by a polic@@ eman who has attacked him on a stroke .

police officers in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where they had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ rate and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via loud@@ speakers on violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ agonist ver@@ ted , by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ disc .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a cerem@@ onial glass window , in order to be re @-@ shaping with a photo of their titles .
in contrast , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a cover @-@ story with a brand in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to tell more about a broken window sli@@ ce than the protests of thousands of people who serve defense of a special thing .
this must also recognise that if one is strictly against all the form of atomic damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vand@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an absurd , and the typical violence of the military police are protected by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local indu@@ str@@ ative villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar be@@ atings across Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - based in Spanish sugar mill , irrespective of the fact that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest@@ ing spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar be@@ ech factories .
after the decre@@ asing the sugar industry rose still in the region , and the factory was lost , and after its installations , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes rarely the work .
others re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still mah@@ len .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who is open every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar be@@ ech industry did not smoke his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the sugar be@@ ech factories , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls precisely that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would have obtained the sugar factory , but the promise has not been kept .
the sugar be@@ ech industry already resi@@ sted the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the bad administration choices and climate change .
in 2016 the production reduced 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced Quantity .
the message would have been a mot@@ if for the land for a few decades , but the bad harvest are no more news yet .
why has the Cub@@ an sugar be@@ ech rose ?
the old railway station of the municipality saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar be@@ ech industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar be@@ es were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production facility amo@@ unted to 4 million tons .
they only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar@@ s on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain a pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; agricultural spec@@ tives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Economic and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would manage roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely come in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in the sugar@@ s of Lav@@ ander@@ o on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry .
the following years , the st@@ agn@@ ation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez since 1967 in the factory .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closing of the factory , is the word he is most repeated , &quot; betra@@ yal . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
thus the place is maintained , they formed a full time - working group .
in the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recognised documents that were removed only with regard to the parts which would be removed , the add@@ res@@ at and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any discharge .
from there the responsibility was over@@ cast and the letters have always been more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the breast@@ feeding factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for yet in operation , in@@ sured .
Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the pension in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will in the stand@@ still of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part that he left , dismant@@ led one of his 31 working @-@ years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and other important work producers has been er@@ ased .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work stations and services that generated the facilities in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the dam@@ ar president saw in the eyes of the present persons , as he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar@@ be@@ et factories
since 2004 sugar is only highly extrac@@ ted by the deposit .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years the people &apos;s parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar lo@@ ops completed , or better said than they began , they also listened to , the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene , and Eddy were looking for other factories .
you have been to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people have left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even produce for the supply of the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

the workshop takes up that the young participants in talks topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance , or whatever in mind comes up .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
since the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ op@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the Highway of the Highway 16 , a road @-@ section in West@@ kan@@ ada , at the nearly two dozen most cases indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video games to arran@@ ging how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences from globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youth control the languages of the First Nations not always mut@@ u@@ alism .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation have started , the ref@@ rain is sung to C@@ ree .
the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip Hop group , which gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree lie@@ h .
at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is at disposal the St@@ rop@@ he in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me .
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day you &apos;ll take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
they can grow and lead to our youth in just as far as our youth .
this is how they can do what the Creator is determined .
in the commentary case the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ co@@ w ( which also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show the potential customers what exactly on the menu is , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin rolling pur@@ u ( the individual of the dishes , &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) from every food , which is served in this restaurant .
customers watch these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those sculp@@ tural dishes that were documented by the German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most of the Japanese people these plastic dishes are so usually that they are not even more stri@@ ving to them . however , a new trend is transformed into sp@@ lic@@ ed mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of Social Media Links and photos , which show this unusual tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ way sandy .
now on sale : new with plastic bags decor@@ ated cell hing@@ es as they are shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ ed bus@@ y@@ ments , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ck@@ hin refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of Es@@ sen@@ ders will increasingly become more costly .
in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular tour with seafood ) turned into a cell sign .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile @-@ stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo &apos;s railway station .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to see such an apple with a cand@@ le for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing ap@@ on@@ ment into strange .
some phone @-@ stru@@ ts and phone @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon will be used , a popular to@@ pping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appet@@ ite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile @-@ stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon .
further sk@@ im@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # the one of the only Anc@@ elle
if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the Bel@@ i@@ ef@@ al of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .

a Mexican project tells the stories of the survi@@ vor@@ s of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico the missing and gear@@ boxes regularly emerge only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this fight with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , pressing the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the trau@@ ma or the municipalities that have learned to live with the pain .
here are behind each body , behind every level of secret in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories numerous parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portals is the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ al a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with drug dealers living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) to give these sacrific@@ es a voice and tells stories of people working in the battle between criminal enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anim@@ al Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug beg@@ s and have to drive whole congreg@@ ations so many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who has been secret every weekend to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who are on only one day their father , their four brethren , lost her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are also preparing for the task that we have asked ourselves and are looking for gra@@ ves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras M@@ ata .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an e @-@ shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are looking for the insurance of my father , but that does not get paid off because they demand a death assessment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ al a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who tackle fear . we have to demonstrate the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk gen@@ tiles .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reading from Anim@@ al Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central mex@@ ico .
your contribution will remind us that violence should never be viewed as normal , no matter what shape it occurs :
I have known this disease for some years now .
every day I come to time sched@@ ules and see the page @-@ pages with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or other types of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is intim@@ ately or sad . it affects like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
you write further :
no , it is not normal that my 10 year old cous@@ in thinks that he will be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of criminal off@@ ences when they go through the streets .
for me that is , when they s@@ cri@@ es those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens .
I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in one stati@@ stic .
the in@@ ess@@ ness of man is incredible to me if the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neigh@@ bou@@ red place are so justified that they were settled . &quot;
I think they try to speak that they are spar@@ ed of such trag@@ e@@ dies , if they are not tou@@ ching and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months revival in the capital city district . &quot; therein , it describes how armed crimes spent for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business , but also had to demol@@ ished her family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain in it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also have changed .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are away , the better .
they lock her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they will cause you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how one cri@@ es . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega released the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the dangerous city of Mex@@ ik@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a commodity , and he tells himself that he co@@ oks to himself , how to make a egg , potatoes br@@ oth , tortil@@ las warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the rivers with water , sugar and dairy powder .
he tells about the nine s@@ cars on his left leg , one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the lives of violence , and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , one told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home , the bloody aw@@ che of his father saw that were shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the murder of civil security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we should not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ il@@ a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched an Anim@@ al Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico Project , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug dealers , which has been tor@@ tured in the last four decades , in a more understandable way .
when one picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages that he linked , include images based on which violence is presented .
the fact check is important at a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or or for@@ gery .
but how is the years after the first time sur@@ faced ? content in social media , no matter if true or false , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible trial seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first publication it was mis@@ leading , trag@@ e@@ dies who actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there was abundant careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our longing for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
2010 passed a pet@@ rol truck in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people killed .
after the civil war , in Africa two biggest land had been neglected and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became too dangerous paths of head@@ phones that were difficult to drive .
typically , the pet@@ rol trucks fell victim to the victim .
official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ing houses ran@@ ked including a cin@@ emas near , which was full of people who illustr@@ ates the World Cup .
houses ver@@ ti@@ ered and en@@ co@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered over the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture entitled &quot; Das is Nigeria &quot; . from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ere Photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it displays rows short@@ ened body , which rests on the floor during persons they see .
but this is where history does not end its end .
over the years the same picture has been tap@@ ed several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to trag@@ e@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened to Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before which they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burned down and sur@@ name runs in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only from satellite images could depic@@ t the following period exempl@@ ary .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the arm@@ rests point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eries and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerge from the DR Congo again , when it was proven itself as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ normal use of the image from the DR Congo is in fact a number of mis@@ ses ; Africa check has been direc@@ tional about Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases , the picture was taken as a let@@ tering for mass donations .
still a step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange entered also in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a light@@ ning , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape , and et@@ op@@ tic t@@ ote , some by burn .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following that these descriptions have brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an su@@ di @-@ Arab news page , which was mis@@ directed by the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians would have participated in the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to reveal this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ seh@@ oods had written this statement , but had not associated with the picture from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling range to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from anywhere around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse photo @-@ search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information borders can cross . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed image gallery with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 photos , which are very similar to the owned picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mis@@ erable private site , platforms social media and community , and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent wrong reports , others have tried to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing .
we have limited examples of the ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries based on what page they have been published . thus , we want to be more clearly defined as the language alone .
of the countries below ( which are in some cases also joined together ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here some cases which can now be fully cle@@ ared ( on the map in orange ) :

Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page affir@@ med that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an being was introduced in 2012 , that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students , which were en@@ rolled by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Far Side of An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not origin@@ ate from the killing , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar &quot; Shi@@ ite attack . &quot;
when the picture was later related to the B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in Um@@ lauf , trying to re@@ voke the newspaper El Pa@@ is that there would be connections to Nigeria .

USA , 2015 .
the picture was made as evidence of the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ et ) , but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context .
instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
once a message that was alle@@ ge@@ dly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , in turn , there will be discussion for@@ ks like this here at the Vietnamese , and said it to the cover .
from the emb@@ assy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are more confirmed examples of an faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the board in Gray ) , Tin@@ Eye can also be completely re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / data clos@@ est@@ amp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and buried them on image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all of these cases , which appeared clearly after the original un@@ wind from 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that follow these Post@@ s . the first frame foc@@ uss@@ ed on religion .
the photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ yas of Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion want to understand and the value human life is both important . therefore it is worth exam@@ ining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images no longer faith .
with social media , there are tens of people who acci@@ dentally believe the water around a tragedy .
suggested that atmosphere of mis@@ - and fal@@ seh@@ ood , that actual atro@@ cities committed un@@ true and narrow it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of extensive images has already been discussed in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ holding of images of a ref@@ us@@ al equ@@ als , the tragedy can be disc@@ ern@@ ed . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent pictures readers and spect@@ ators des@@ ens@@ iti@@ ze and give them the ability to emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , who sought how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is some of a lot of regard to extensive depic@@ tions in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techni@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests a somewhat of what actually can be dis@@ solved from the context or on completely mis@@ use nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any investigation of false supplements should also be taken into consideration how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of small@@ ish languages
photo of Andy Simm@@ ons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. re@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to provide language fans from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ matched words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish just bre@@ d ) .
but all resi@@ sts stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly in each attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be meant by that .
these unique words were already collected quite a long time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , whereas the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find example words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u like :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ate you for your parents in recognition of how to try you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after you have spar@@ ed off on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they wear other cultures , reve@@ aling other memorial @-@ cat@@ ches and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site even more of these &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ asure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favourite s@@ words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is related to the worst v@@ ein disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst flood of flood and ground@@ ing disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , the usually end of May , the rivers Cal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered 15 district in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster prepar@@ edness of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of fluid and h@@ amm@@ ates .
more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to a 304 @-@ term stay .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water conditions in some areas were slowly returning .
health and hygien@@ ic relationships are a massive challenge facing the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like Azz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the scale of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flo@@ ods are wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ etic crisis , save save the Children , after further re@@ perc@@ ussions are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stand in the flood , water resistance up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda at G@@ alle also flood@@ ed because of the yesterday over@@ powered water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for lif@@ eshi@@ ps and another five are made for transport of emergency services for those made in flood@@ ed villages immersed in their flood@@ ed villages .
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ i in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on ground@@ water and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue plans Dro@@ h@@ nen for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and life @-@ making goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 777@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 to if animals in this area need help .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asked people who share their s@@ iting data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ac@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ se Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me led a &quot; High @-@ water aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then passed free to the sr@@ il@@ iser R@@ ote cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they conducted a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS @-@ button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousands of requests and 150 successful boat trips for the result of flood and ground@@ ing people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts made by the Government and the civil population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need for security and help support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan now faces the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use conc@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bou@@ red and dear friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trusted me to her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we call for guns for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next step , we create rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and men , some hold the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied from an American flag , other sk@@ in@@ ding particles against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work , or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
you dis@@ integrate myself .
there are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we prac@@ tise our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim on different kinds . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination so well that once Muslims , which as I do not fit there , dis@@ sec@@ urely .
ab@@ outs will be mis@@ led
I am not alone with this .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry in America is master@@ fully sold : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in mind , if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er mus@@ li@@ fied pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western sense , religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one consists of the reduced images of Muslims , which have been col@@ oni@@ alized in Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting picture language is determined by the dark man who ought to fear and the exotic wife you should save .
the landmark Palestinian Arab scientist Edward S@@ aid zer@@ lay the story behind these paintings in the 19@@ 70s .
but these images also stand out even today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood honour them continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , f@@ law@@ ful nar@@ rative of our news@@ fe@@ eds .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have managed their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female President of Presi@@ dents .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely often fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from their government to cover their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and to cover the Muslim women through their government to cover its entire body that both are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group pract@@ ising his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened mus@@ lim@@ bic women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim Pra@@ yers have been spoken on American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were also associated with slave @-@ birds .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rati@@ vely has shi@@ fted our collective imagination so deeply and faul@@ ty that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ oxid@@ ant attacks and barriers .
because of these stories , that we tell and because of the way we tell it is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ rative , who help us understand the world .
and my industry is failure to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims defeated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are South @-@ Swedish Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother presented her first cost@@ ume design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard to the skyscr@@ apers of New York ; skyscr@@ apers were made possible by the Muslim , American che@@ ers from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then as Khan was thinking about the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ avoid@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ um@@ med Muslim ma and American ?
sometimes , if I ask people why I do not have por@@ k recipes , I say - instead of my Muslim recipe , or to carry my hand@@ some handker@@ chi@@ efs that all Muslims bear in himself - &quot; from respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ okes , we do not wear all the handker@@ chi@@ pper with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be no the@@ ological experts in order to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make efforts to fight widespread lies across Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ism in@@ convenience with don@@ ors , th@@ ink tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information , which is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories that we tell and due to the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than one stran@@ ger , who has be@@ aked a woman the head scar@@ f .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly form attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so versatile and diverse that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

use approved .
I want to explain that .
I was born as Muslim ma , but a Muslim ma was born until I was four years old when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of an Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social forces describe religious life , they draw on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ onal faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neigh@@ bor in the Bran@@ dung , I see Muslim ma when it could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the final ritual with my daughter , when I wi@@ eld them in my arms and have the Arabic verses to protect the protection that pop@@ ulate the cor@@ an and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see .
my Muslim belief is probably not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an icon @-@ Competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to my grand@@ mother is the image of my grand@@ mother , with her sisters , as they did a contest of the art of flor@@ ist in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I close to that moment when I close my eyes : N@@ ano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi hol@@ ger ; and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can almost im@@ pose them .
Muslims means to speak the prayers they had said to me if I have a bad day .
Muslim ma is to be what she taught me to relate to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that was colon@@ ized by centuries - through an &quot; Empire &quot; colony , which has founded a company with the name Ehr@@ ent British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Komp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord to call .
the author@@ ship in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and listen to that men can not cry , but at the same time to see that my con@@ vic@@ ted grandfather cri@@ es .
inter@@ st@@ ine , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence K@@ asch@@ mir@@ s , we@@ pt N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ embr@@ aced by his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he did not enter into his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like with my grandfather , from colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world like at stake .
Muslim ma means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ized all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first fli@@ er@@ bom@@ b was dis@@ car@@ ded over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , mir@@ ac@@ ic sub@@ ordin@@ ate of the British empire , was referred to by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; since he brought the first mosque in England .
even before there was planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and pre@@ ached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion to belong deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess ; our un@@ founded history .
it means remember@@ ing that prior to four@@ teen years , the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent aside from the Antarc@@ tica , to im@@ itate weapons of mass destruction , which did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
an American Muslims means knowing that the su@@ icide rate of veter@@ ans since 2001 has risen by more than 32 percent .
it means knowing that when a tragedy is native to the USA and the susp@@ ects have a Muslim name that will tell the story four times more than a story with a white attacks .
it means knowing that a thousand years ago , the first prayer call , the A@@ za@@ an , was called Bil@@ al by a free black boy .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago a African International schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people filled the airports to fight for a Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
an American writer , a Pak@@ istan@@ is , a P@@ asch@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim ma and a journalist , implies the inherent inter@@ fac@@ tual inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple forms , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ es , but it is represented in the minim@@ izing branches , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother to be a mother to care for my child and all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that power@@ fully and privileged people are established on this doub@@ leb@@ ness .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ stran@@ ts , who began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in trans@@ itory surveillance of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer that takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that ex@@ cludes its borders towards people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely Arabs and Muslims takes to Vis@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we are leading and the bom@@ bs , which we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University show a scienti@@ fic@@ ally in@@ accessible image and b@@ ade them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards the evolution .

the con@@ vers@@ ations we have to guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to en@@ um@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous im@@ prints which we engage in our news editorial actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which are trying to reconc@@ ile our many with bund@@ les ident@@ ities and forgotten history .

and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason why conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House is leading .

a few years ago she had not yet given her ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and history of which I was not aware of when I was as old now , as it is now my daughter , but which today made me an un@@ familiar Muslim ma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I have left here like a lo@@ wer@@ coll@@ ar in my speech .
things , which might wake up memories , for in all the interpre@@ ters that makes our humanity , may make a story of where one is made to another . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ ration wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , from Flick@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity , here and now despite having a language barrier to contact someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the recognition of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ re@@ alis@@ able blog .
however , here the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written form , but on the spoken word . it is a try to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major towns .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne , and Darwin in Australia or O@@ a@@ kland in the United States , where T@@ LS had been carried out since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not get shared there for children there .
for the creators of the project apply :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that must accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to feed in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen often often related to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forced these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to cher@@ ish , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers form their history first in their own language and translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation makes it possible to listen to it .
they call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier .
for example , the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which tells in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , the stor@@ yt@@ ale R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ ate also shows the opportunity to explain the customs of the nar@@ rative of the nar@@ rative .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of h@@ oses and the wh@@ ore in the language Sh@@ ona of Zim@@ babwe :
having declared the meaning of his f@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is that to speak to an audience that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a broad dit@@ ch he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
and they were with me !
so far the events of Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to arrange their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for US sub@@ stitution of the sovereig@@ n debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , took place on the last 3 April 2017 , the march of National Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; out of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( the Front for the neur@@ ons of debts ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church in Puerto Rico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the revival of debt have also filed a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico calls for the politicians , b@@ Ã¤n@@ ker and government agencies responsible for debts to be held accountable for their cor@@ rup@@ acy .
we call for financial testing and a governance committee without personal interest in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding re@@ mun@@ eration , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will be squee@@ zed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ us@@ hing bonuses .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the sovereig@@ n offshore area of the USA - suff@@ ers from severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on government responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :

the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian Web@@ Develop@@ er Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over one year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which will be held in Berlin , devoted to an event by the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist in the French resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , busin@@ ess@@ ant books within three to five days , las@@ ly excer@@ pts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The costs of freedom : a collective post research ) .
the book that was published last year and here is licence @-@ free , contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designer , developers , researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge , have side to side to look over the m@@ ists who gives our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was cancelled out of the directory of Ad@@ ra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information whatsoever about our current state or residence .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Kolle@@ k@@ tive remember@@ ing gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and indeed immediately .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us start to reflect on their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
why have we chosen ?
what have we given up in this process from time to time ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ er for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the imprisonment of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown village .
his wife , the writer and Om@@ bud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police officer was based on a &quot; sever@@ ely secre@@ tly &quot; command@@ ments of the military courts from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as an insi@@ der on Assad &apos;s government and taken note of an alle@@ ged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , b@@ ass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techni@@ ologist and currently over@@ access the lad@@ der of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the gran@@ ting cultural Prot@@ otyp@@ e predicted the work he began with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the elimination of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and in the Greek @-@ Roman architecture of Greek architectural features with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would do everything to em@@ bo@@ died the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
typically , Bass@@ el could not yet close this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call for his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English at , even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he always has shared his knowledge with each who asked . he has taught other incar@@ nations to write and speak English .
Bass@@ el has opened the gate for technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also brought other incar@@ nations how they use computers , at least theoretically , without having actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the writer of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ el which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in cust@@ ody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a year .
she typ@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic region to English .
the book is licence @-@ free .
book from Youssef N@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is devoted to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nora by the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens with every visit ,
that I per@@ ish in the world of your enchanting sight ,
that I lose the recovery in the moment we embrace ,
that any of the haz@@ ards is ,
everyone of the f@@ ences , fishing and gu@@ ardian
I forget the prison of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
which I tr@@ ams with me with passion ,
when your eyes tell you well
and I have a further piece of my soul with you ...
I come back quickly to my lon@@ eliness ,
to take back all those moments ,
and about your absence to smile and smile .
I conf@@ using myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
one year goes , my soul
while , during
I in your c@@ age ,
and you are still in the c@@ age of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ ris@@ ches Network for Human Rights ) more than 65,@@ 000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or executed by the regime disappeared , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope we have to do so for the last time .
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption betra@@ yed director to release from release back to previous post .
Mos@@ ambi@@ cans re@@ acted with anger on a cor@@ rup@@ tive loss , where a govern@@ or returned after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , by which the corruption was committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza that arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other def@@ endants due to suspic@@ ion of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money origin@@ ates from public funds at the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ b@@ aza is in between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately called for his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement in the company , which happened on 19 April then .
in accordance with an opinion in the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s prosec@@ ution , the Republic accepts the application , there would be no barriers to Cam@@ b@@ aza to resume its old posts as the company had no discipl@@ ined proceedings after his det@@ ention .
however , many citizens are not doing this action well .
the Centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , briefly CI@@ P ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle and the decision of the company to re@@ produce the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a proposal in the fight against corruption and clar@@ i@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a rel@@ ay with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the CI@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ ined against the state @-@ resistance .
the company seems obvious , however , and does not result in adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , reject this behavior as well and look at the case as &apos; refu@@ te &apos; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza is a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and half the half had to eat .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could give advice and up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has awak@@ ened to be integrated into the company he helped to harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence .
resistant !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ cans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says , the Director poss@@ essed no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he won &apos;t off@@ end it , I can &apos;t believe anyone in such a way , that the state has already acted so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , has only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ outs made it an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source , and the state itself has become tired , which was un@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te fav@@ ours the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are in the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el &apos;s prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a scar@@ fer , one @-@ powered one and - next to proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most celebrated oral acts as it was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of everything , also the f@@ ather@@ land for its ambitions , its own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I do not know if an ambitious person is changing , my experience shows that which is not so . it changes the tactics but it does not affect its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reactions were also conducted in Twitter :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat after 10 years and was free .
and now he continues the company with which he had mon@@ ies for@@ wards , again under the contract . # As@@ Sim@@ le OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Jud@@ gment of the Angels ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &quot; means C@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or al@@ alter@@ b@@ se .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their post@@ s from the net because it enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin , or in general as an ad@@ j@@ ective &apos; in@@ dic@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fac@@ cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hass@@ an in Burma in Burma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely remote con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate speech against Muslims , who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight @-@ speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
indeed , &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually associated with racism but the word itself does not automatically calls to Hass@@ an .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Post@@ s in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about his use .
furthermore there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair will also be written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &apos; ( late ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos;@@ kal@@ ark@@ aar . ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a rich way , whether they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a word of a word .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the Fr@@ age@@ word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ically - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that it will reduce Hass@@ an radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also empha@@ sized that Facebook analy@@ zes its purpose , before there will be any post@@ cards that ign@@ ites in suspic@@ ion , racism .
Facebook lÃ¶@@ scht the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the Automat@@ ismus will not understand what you write on Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae . &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the Hass@@ an , have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dissemin@@ ate Hass@@ an , may not keep the efficiency of this strategy for long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of perc@@ ei@@ ghts are often a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are to start to use a new word or alternative des@@ crip@@ ts of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook has started to clear his post@@ s when he wanted to communicate with his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and me , the Li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours is prohibited , because the post of the Facebook Community standards did not escape . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of post@@ s from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to portra@@ y their opinions against Hass@@ an radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask questions :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to shave such words will only get more hat@@ red within the different communities .
it seems that they have started without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; her@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ ble post@@ ings .
if they could have more respect for the 15 million benefits , that would adopt a great turnover , that would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks auto c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has supplied with users for much clear@@ ance amongst users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make themselves funny and deliber@@ ately set the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not within the context of Hass@@ an , to see if their post@@ ers will be taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ Post@@ s , which did not show com@@ bo language , but nevertheless you have been removed .
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and as a pe@@ an cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removed the post , containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , cure people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , with permission .
in the past five years far nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to extend their votes and their influence over the past five years .
among other things , Hass@@ an , on social networks , the violence in the communities in Myanmar is also to heat , specifically in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ins , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to conf@@ use the s@@ late Hass@@ an on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
but instead of being simply putting the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better ongoing , rather focused more on context than on the code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the chil@@ ds
a wedding ring in the sand .

the chil@@ ds is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country adopted un@@ anim@@ ously a law which is to offer this practice , so that the advis@@ able age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the husband , some members held Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a large public sh@@ outing . then , the leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , formed of a group , the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not inter@@ ming@@ le , since that , age does not im@@ pose the maturity . &quot;
this is , irrespective of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contracting of the UN Women &apos;s right Convention , the Min@@ ority als , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married at 15 were married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical purpose of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to set up laws for children before , followed at the foot and were great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring this outcome .
nevertheless it was not all smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Hin@@ du @-@ leader for example , B. had no concerns about the critics of the children before , they ought to dam@@ n &apos;t care for their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sort of religious opposition have actually bot@@ her@@ ed by tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and eventually there came in doubt whether the opposition would agree to the law of the law at all .
yet at the beginning of 2017 the wording against the children before decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and will announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which has re@@ posted the Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ramb@@ har@@ at : the bill of Law@@ yer against the children of Children was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after being agreed in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws of the children before finally had been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who died a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary sp@@ ede that has lost the heart of the matter , but know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal , and that &apos;s almost every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of my opinion was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which implies : , Her@@ vor@@ rag@@ ing News !
the husband is decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the hard age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious conf@@ essions 18 years .
the design to change the spouse was today decided on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives and there were 35 members in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members who oppose them have been campa@@ ign@@ ing for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chil@@ ds is legally permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ isch@@ ild@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have imagined it .
Con@@ gr@@ ats .
a thank you to Our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aja therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed his intention to undertake justice steps , the law should be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promises .
during the prosec@@ ut@@ or @-@ General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advocate of the law , argu@@ ed , it is quite right@@ fully , when Mahar@@ aja against the law pre@@ sup@@ poses , the majority of social media users would wish to address the debate in different ways .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that we could give up the state into our bedroom , simply targeted about it , that the state , our daughters previously assumed that they may be of great , obst@@ et@@ ted men who are facing in advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion more ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legally legal , or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they say .

due to the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was described on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the US , internationally regarded .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a month , Turkey has now joined the popular and on the crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crow@@ ds@@ ourcing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
day by day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ por@@ ters and fans of TV series are against the block@@ age .
although many techn@@ ologically se@@ ated internet users are used to use det@@ ecting tools for block @-@ block websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been app@@ alled from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society an der Har@@ vard University has been signed , regular block@@ ages of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the most known country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sides ( sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform installed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ network ( i.e. calcul@@ ators ) which is not based on the domain name and makes it difficult to make a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available in spite of the pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports on his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and shared manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia @-@ content even if they cannot achieve the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS also gave that this step is independent from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ yp@@ ass the sperm .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sag@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to bring similar levels of mir@@ rors , when in the country Wikipedia Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one attacks to another URL that is not the original one . that which one then sees is from Wikipedia .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with po@@ ul@@ sive mot@@ if@@ s and balanced colors .
the motiv@@ ate him to carry him a camera in himself and to try to bl@@ end the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar makes every effort to get to the international scene at the age of 28 .
and his hom@@ etown direct next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that guides the attention to Nep@@ as wildlife .
he described on Facebook as he is able to help him with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate Wild@@ tier@@ grapher ! !
I rested just at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had given a call from my Father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately , I started off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was found and I immediately began to kne@@ eled pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with authorities to acquire global recognition for growth as natural and wants to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not as sc@@ ary as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already in face to face to face :
a tiger is not bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep @-@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately approaches , we see ourselves and he is dist@@ orted by the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ hi@@ kers and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent in order to make the Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days , until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live close to the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

this paper was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally written to Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was also released here as part of a content @-@ Shar@@ ing Convention .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the names of their sp@@ ouses and even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh provide women to respecting the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ diagnosed this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned to the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a p@@ leb@@ ook and har@@ med by her family and the village of the village , after having responded to a hal@@ ted relatives by name .
the tradition of their wives also do not name the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less related to fear , if at all , they should not get this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , played nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus quickly become the main @-@ looking theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the patri@@ archy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs , which there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and campa@@ ign@@ ing to reduce the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years with the help of practices , such as children &apos;s disease to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and guides these clubs .
it tells about how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they have made them both amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in the thro@@ es .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in her discussion , was of women who do not name her husband .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to talk about the patri@@ arch@@ ate conversation with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of her husband does not seem to speak according to the name of her husband , is a model that they all put on duty and never question@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition test@@ ified that a woman wishes to respect her husband and wishes to him a long life .
a woman who does not with@@ hold this is seen as a shar@@ ply , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition has been so deeply rooted , that we have never thought up to this panel .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband until now , at home , trying out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long , after the video was at the end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ der him from now on with his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini was a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh .
after the vide@@ o@@ projection the women resear@@ ching the discussion with a exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it means they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands about the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women must never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she went off throughout the whole exercise , but another chose to release the whole aff@@ lu@@ ous fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ led him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient bro@@ ok , the women decided that they actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands with their name .
and they stopped their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she placed the women in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
a different club member chose to do it in dinner prior to the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was star@@ red , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband in a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini tells how women have tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the gal@@ van@@ illa red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ est@@ ate :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would bear the zin@@ i@@ red spot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he just laugh@@ ed and I listened to him to carry him .
the other women have not ceased completely with it , but my , they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making a trip to each of the discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last few months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and spoke about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years now and I have made some things , such as our ident@@ ities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they happen .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women have carried only ancho@@ red in the group since their marriage .
for most of it is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ mon @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a tro@@ users ; they have not dr@@ aut .
after a lot of contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of your own clos@@ selection , mor@@ als connected to the sar@@ is and much more , sh@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini its own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could carry them .
next , they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it .
on the question whether in the five months since their first discussion , it has changed a little , the Roh@@ ini , that things slowly coming into roles :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband to say .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women are now wearing zinc @-@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the f@@ use of more freedom of movement or their own clos@@ et - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explained :
&quot; &quot; &quot; each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . it will give a chain reaction , if each woman walks home in the club and other people of it , what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs had been taken .
two men have been arrested and resulted in that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are to be used .
it may give the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a glorious man would bring gold in old or ri@@ ches , the pol@@ ym@@ is@@ pre@@ cher from Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks were registered on smooth men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the aim of ass@@ ass@@ ination for ob@@ sc@@ ure is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 held a mission in the South African country to investigate these pract@@ ising .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and prejudi@@ ces .

the persecution and ass@@ ass@@ ination of glorious rituals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ aceae , has cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sham@@ ans within order ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head would have power to be the ri@@ ches of ri@@ ches .
in the last days three men were mur@@ dered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha informed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ ger poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces :

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently taken .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u became sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , after having taken part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that has been calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Foreign Ministry in China has cited Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told he did it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China still receives views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or permit it to be a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ red to the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
show Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials in late June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .

Norway &apos;s Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister in Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway broke out in Sto@@ u , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government mitt@@ edly , that this is ultimately nothing to do with deciding .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . in June , Norway was signed an agreement to resume after China , since exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
having changed the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen , the Nobel Committee had his hope for an unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to its det@@ ention he was not able to record his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house ar@@ rest and permit to seek to seek medical support where he wants .

a spokes@@ woman in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AF@@ P on June 27th , that the message received the Chinese authorities urge to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia of their house ar@@ rest .
the message from the US Embassy passed a rag@@ ing response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Ministry , that &quot; no country have the right to embrace this and un@@ answer@@ able remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as travel agents and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they have the according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government to leave Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you on :
Canada calls for China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to safeguard and allow for the exercise of these rights to apply .
France

it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been pun@@ ished with a harmon@@ ious , stur@@ dier and prosper@@ ous China , which had contributed again to a peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on the international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am should be seen as a town in Singapore .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the lawyers of the State of New York , the Minister expressed that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it is compared to other countries .
he is support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a land .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to turn the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , according to all our efforts and sacrific@@ es to create this valuable land , one does not hear that we are not a land .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape in front of the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my land , what country is it then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am led reasons were not very pos@@ h : it did not defend an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that it was inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore will be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ it@@ arian machines , which prev@@ ailed to be the Democrats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am gave answers to his US guests in regard to our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ated , our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions must be tar@@ mac with non @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very thankful when our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid to be part of the city &apos;s government .
by placing his comment on the blog , he points to reviews that you should begin to read the entire contribut@@ ors of the conference to understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore a city is and not a country .
read the instructions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said why the elections in Singapore were so in@@ compar@@ ative , even if we were looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was engaged in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party in a decade ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously does not have it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who as leaders of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice has said , very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old gar@@ ment , what I expect - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he truly believes what is really being associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review submitted the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ enten :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ chief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , on which country leave the sovereig@@ n rights of the city Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is both the country and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he plays an important role within the module , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am is of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the Lon@@ ers afford their military service , they defend their city but not their land ?
whom do our Prime Minister have to pay b@@ ills ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city ?
to record the magazine Jour@@ ney of a decade to the affir@@ mation , Singapore , and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have become much more expensive ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your location or home country ?
your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , revealed to the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan .
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to show an interest in his conversation by asking personal questions .
then my clar@@ i@@ fications then follows the standard answers : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans bo@@ il perhaps in@@ war@@ dly in front of anger when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t b@@ other me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that diff@@ ers us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a can@@ adi@@ c flag well visible in their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Canadian .
Americans however ...
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march in Iraq and before 11 September .
Canadi@@ ans have always taken small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their amer@@ ican neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there are no weapons !
Equ@@ al mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is supposed to be said to be the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we can@@ adi@@ er are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mired .
I wouldn &apos;t make me anything if you would like to examine me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
first of all , called &quot; nice &quot; to be called &quot; nice &quot; to be bad - just as the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ son &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double ) .
if Canada has really been a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
neg@@ li@@ gible , means to be un@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and have no attention to earn .
this can be something good if one doesn &apos;t want to stop in the background , away from the things that happen around one .
I would even come as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , a main peculi@@ ar of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders are called &apos; nice &apos; is maybe just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans are not talking about the fence along with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I can now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Just@@ in Tru@@ deau put the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our Prime Minister has made Canada pretty sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that took over the Jun@@ ta which took over power in 2014 and re @-@ establishing the civil government , continuing to re@@ construct the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them what rules his girlfriend does .
although not expressly political , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was used by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of song was an amazing success .
in the first three days the video was divided on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists raised the public to look at this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
let &apos;s take a look at these recordings of the video that have followed up some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives the com@@ mander of absolute absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Change Your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to det@@ ach activists and other critics in the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised the online content and subjects those who have thrown , the monarchy is persec@@ uted to prosec@@ ute the monarchy .
Thailand is putting a stri@@ ste to &quot; read majest@@ y &quot; ( majest@@ y ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to be prosec@@ uted , their decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy , although security professionals they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video there is even shown how people will be thrown into a black supply , another problem occurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they sup@@ pos@@ edly causes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and they will be benef@@ itted for long det@@ ention , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band displayed the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin @-@ enemies while the 2014 protests .

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ v@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Nazi war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the deser@@ ted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show a distinctive images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armenia lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the biggest part of Russians and evenings live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in settlements .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirits .
this phenomenon is characteristic of the T@@ ku@@ archiv .
since 2011 the total population of the Euro 16.@@ 000 people saw , after over a decade there was hardly ever increased .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ cas , stand symbo@@ lic@@ ally for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fall and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met an native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard to stop this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community .
now , there is only paved road with hi@@ on@@ est spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people that were once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central business sector of the Soviet Union , have now abandoned the district .
in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which can accommodate another one or two families , one can recognize the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discover me with the camera in his hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother chose us to photograph ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply has us forbidden , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers her girlfriend somewhat and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish @-@ sized mining enterprise called T@@ ku@@ v@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for the own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable @-@ growing .
it is difficult over the rounds to come .
the District administration in winter will provide free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what is happening , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not abandoned before Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ an to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she instead supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly r@@ aments are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; there is too .
T@@ ante G@@ alya tells you that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with their own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a recent neighbour on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; you said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what is happening , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s conversation together with her husband and five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds on the village of the village in front of the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the Land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative district of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to build a house there , but that will still take something , &quot; she declar@@ es re@@ um@@ ble .
Nat@@ ascha receives for each child about $ 9 children &apos;s money .
your husband works in the char@@ coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as nur@@ sery at once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells that first a very frigh@@ tening situation was when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day like the city and war were once . &quot;
when our talk is til@@ ted to the end , a little boy in us is over .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy j@@ agt him behind .
he plays with the ball , which is then down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones at the exp@@ iry building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for imm@@ eas@@ iness in their lives .
you do not know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located on the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - J@@ old Mex@@ ik@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ allen @-@ pink sand@@ wich and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ular form .
she is born in Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . yet , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on tour .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 Dollar the night sleep in simple rooms , with large numbers , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Peru@@ vian immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you to Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
do not want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they purchases them medications that they do not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that sco@@ red from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama was a suitable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil but is it for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move toward the north .
the family had heard of other companions of M@@ um Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a Guest from Haiti .
he tells the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that , Afri@@ cans already talk to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
how many of his departure @-@ companion has lived in Brazil before and has worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup world .
when the Brazilian economy has we@@ aker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ um Africa : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells you that their guests will often send their text messages if they are proceeding to gr@@ ati@@ ate them or to report you over the course of their trip .
she explained that her Christian faith was the drive of their work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chickens as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants that travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter in Valen@@ cian Community and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ stu@@ ets can be sold to numerous African refugees too expensive .
he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered to them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a washing machine outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he told . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I passed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived three years , he referred to a raid on his employment site from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had flo@@ wn away from people in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single @-@ pul@@ sion , has offered him its roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and tried to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the courses , the travelers calm their phones .
a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she sits in her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ ets which you made a cli@@ ent@@ in , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old .
they lau@@ gh when she gave me briefly before .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; she repeatedly repeated every time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;

on 10 July , the mobile phone number in Tian@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi was a mobile notification , in which it re@@ jects the District government , a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the notification it is said that the App &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to obtain access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but col@@ Ã²@@ n@@ ates the public authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had replaced the app , News with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police force that the app would identify the sources and the distribution paths of terrorists alongside &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hazardous information &quot; &quot; &quot; , including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block of porno@@ graphic websites , on online sc@@ ams , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to inform users of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state players or even h@@ acker can enable the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China are mostly concentrated on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ Ã¼@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , inf@@ alli@@ ed ethnic minority countries like Xin@@ jiang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conf@@ lic@@ ting areas , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ ing Internet chi@@ pping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from the mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Out@@ puts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , the cen@@ sored messages published in China showed photos of a Check@@ point , at the polic@@ emen the inhabitants discrimin@@ ated by so as if they installed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Send In@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official X@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification calls for the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a proposal for the technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the expansion technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fa@@ ith Don@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also published a Jing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the passwords of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of Jing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobil@@ es in Xin@@ jiang to electronic manu@@ als .
the rules in Jing@@ w@@ ang may possibly take a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s Party to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and associated facilities , including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computer and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in Xin@@ jiang , the authorities on June 27th , in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August sign their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , not@@ ebooks , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; with local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy . however , this action will viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for quite a number of other possible per@@ missions , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything about death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in a number of &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has taken his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you are looking for you and you realize that you are totally alone in one place where everything is essential .
everything has turned aside and reveals a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable , clearly visible both from the inside and outside .
one who makes her name all glory .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , which will not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you saw the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings of flesh and blood , and all sh@@ outs to death .
all doubt solve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the Earth caught on the axis of the we@@ dge . you become clear that you are tr@@ apped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to er@@ ected stone .
they have arrested me and my father thre@@ e@@ fold , but I don &apos;t forget that I will learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Council , with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us , demonstr@@ ating even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five you@@ ths were cut off during a peaceful protest , like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns out to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts , only my own did not .
for the first time it was quiet , rainy , for the wrong time , even if I did not meet high demands on a city that is to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply in the quarters was stopped .
I broke the silence , by cri@@ ed several times &quot; all@@ ine Ak@@ bar &quot; of my house from my house .
I listened to my voice by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to muster .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we feder@@ ate ourselves to a pra@@ y@@ ful picture that ful@@ fills my expectations full and entirely fulfilled .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but you are not interested in the righteous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready to meet us at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can give you your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mu@@ y Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to scre@@ am if we are not in the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ated eyes set herself on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really feel what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was on my Tor@@ dness , van@@ ity ; perhaps the revolution .
I wasn &apos;t sure of my job when I said , &quot; I did not think that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I believe I have never heard , to look in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fat@@ ale consequences for me and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary and his father equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gest@@ ure of this dist@@ orted sentence is up to now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I terri@@ fy the farm .
in the first office I will leave everything I had to do with me .
then re @-@ sto@@ cked through the court and into the second office that leads through a course to the single cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I support the room .
otherwise they probably have a bigger cell on this time .
I don &apos;t have to share with just one another prison@@ er , and may immediately put me back without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell and I attacked on an old @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist to beat the wall .
I learned that my cell@@ ular @-@ guy was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sth@@ amm@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he told me ultimately .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells there was an un@@ seen man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; the Doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness don &apos;t let me recognize un@@ marked facial copies , and doctors are here not ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers belong to his own existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him when I stay .
LÃ¼@@ g@@ ner .
I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cl@@ ut@@ ors who lab@@ s themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear it still &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the hor@@ ror of every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the color of forgiveness until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; they are here to be heard . &quot;
so that the secret was wr@@ apped : to protect the security of us from us and prevent the s@@ lan@@ der and the terrorists in us , they speak at the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their denomin@@ ational card hand and betra@@ yed the narrow points of view of her world view .
this is not a home here , this is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cal@@ lands into a hero .
I support the inter@@ rog@@ acy and tre@@ ad to Abu I@@ mad , a slim , and st@@ amp@@ ed man ; at least he is coming to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expres@@ sions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start doing so much more important with your life when you close this day and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer , not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to be pun@@ ished at ease , even though I did nothing to earn this punishment .
at penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to pl@@ uck myself as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the lov@@ ingly &apos; Gest@@ Ã¤n@@ d@@ nis . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er goes to your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot with@@ hold your terror .
my ven@@ ere@@ ie fell not enough for him why she re@@ plac@@ eable the pipe through a cable .
in my first det@@ ention I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage dump or whether that belongs to the normal work internally .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their perspective , great invention of a huge cab@@ al .
within one hour three of them are altern@@ ately changing , while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped to scre@@ am .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no favour , which is why he perceived as a neighbour to an electric rod .
flow through my entire body , enough to feed my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ cris@@ p body , which was stretched on the ground was the perfect flow of power .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had met his duty for that night .
it must have been so for midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; say we sometimes , that was my only option .
some hours left , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the dawn fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I responded with the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ff youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be terri@@ bly worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and evidence you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they run me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ det about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smok@@ es a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he slim to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine gr@@ ot@@ enes .
he lives at the top floor of his family house , which ended them since 1967 ; in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which it had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
since six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate active , who presents the conservative majority and asks their old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ musik .
with his music , who often deal with issues such as Orient@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . all these issues do not only find themselves in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that suff@@ ers from Damascus in Syria up to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders , and he can suffer according to their own testimony with the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it , he attacks against US American foreign policy a special dis@@ incl@@ ination .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe its sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war areas , anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian population of the second generation &quot; - so he referred to himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while in water sho@@ ok in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . at this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to fa@@ sten .
the law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot j@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the r@@ ots of warm coffee and the sc@@ ales of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose , in the first instance of freedom .
sometime , Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all when looking into the neighboring countries .
from therefore avo@@ ids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water to drink - not to land in prison .
recently the interior of Jordan has cancelled a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic State of the Islamic State of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual front of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and speak the main reason for the concert .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that had been told the concert &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the k@@ ang@@ ers .
many argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m that puts the old @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a , the j@@ ord@@ atur@@ a people as a &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might be probably not simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but is indeed a more evident in the cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan that appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work clearly .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b built traditional sex @-@ men to be gro@@ omed by impos@@ ing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the image shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of an apparently d@@ amp@@ ed un@@ known woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them .
over the past few years in Jordan the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; has increased dramatically - the un@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch therefore achieved its cul@@ mination in 2016 by the number of honour mor@@ de in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support women , victims &apos; victims &apos; victims &apos; or domestic violence .
according to a law to counter death control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to danger in inner @-@ families &quot; and for their release is often a very long @-@ bureaucr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy back from issues that remain in his country as tab@@ ular .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b indu@@ bit@@ able that his work is political , however , that he has his music , the full of explicit lawyers to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I became aware of politics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in an attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically at the core can be proce@@ eded .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and each other is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want , &quot; be it belief or non @-@ belief , Het@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on gender equality were strongly cen@@ sored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , in order to notice that his comments from the context began to be dist@@ orted , and how his opinion had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was just a edited version , &quot; says he .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not talk to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eigh@@ th century , which is still remembered today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what should be working later on behalf of the cali@@ ppers , in the eigh@@ th century could write openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be sil@@ enced .
still recently , in January 2017 , the current news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the grounds , they had expressed critical about the problems in social media dealing with deep @-@ ro@@ oting corruption in the country .
given that the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believe that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural changes in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him progress is a continuous driving and taking . Jordan has wo@@ unded over the second time in a row , but the way of progress - this is what it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , printed and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society .
I also dre@@ amed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also from a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region through music , art and literature will become a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , spreading inf@@ its and artificial nature in hand @-@ led democr@@ acies . at least , he hopes that .
until the time there is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also res@@ ist resistance .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war@@ fare are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the ne@@ uta festivals .
you assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory has been handed over for over a thousand years and out of time , in the arm@@ ies from the west of Japan in the northeast mar@@ ching to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi to force into the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to sn@@ ap a couple of great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a communal centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have long been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two festivals are straight to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the ne@@ uta festival the only true one - and to spend a stunning way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high fe@@ wag@@ ering was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to encourage a legitimate profession like the hairdres@@ sers .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road @-@ smoking and illegal drugs are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region may not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to make up more and more norm@@ alities in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles which can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity , even has an annual event , inspi@@ res the Cont@@ ests of the hairdres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; since 2014 .
there are experts against each other in order to show who can create of the ec@@ centric run@@ ners as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the School August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and get training in hair@@ dressing art , allowing them to find jobs .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered do@@ zens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .

Colombia : love letters to Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ac@@ ulture

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lov@@ bot@@ her@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write just love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who have turned out to accommodate affection ?
just this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Foundation , and inspired it to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write in letters , gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , her country was in the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ abe@@ we@@ dge F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the signat@@ ures of the peace treaty as so important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for his mer@@ its the Nobel Peace Prize .
however , it is still a long way from the Colom@@ bian@@ Woman , until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ cks , who lived in illegal war@@ fare that were exposed to many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out around the clock to enter their weapons as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian company again , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep @-@ hat@@ red opposite Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ ak@@ Ã¤@@ ff@@ ers , it must take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Kolum@@ bi@@ ans must join and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love bot@@ her@@ ed to former times of gu@@ err@@ illa to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa absor@@ bers which are to be passed personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for letters to reconciliation arose in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in February 2017 in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian was able to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people who we love , am Valentine &apos;s thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much unnecessary .
he said , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed most pressing .
thus , the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history towards a common story of peace , say they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolum@@ bi@@ ens as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ I never imagined that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the university of J@@ aver@@ iana at Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC put themselves on how they had done earlier to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders but letters full of sub@@ sist@@ ence of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that in between lies , &quot; told the policy @-@ knowledge of Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a staff of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had passed the letters , a former figh@@ ter led me through the camp of the Gu@@ er@@ illa figh@@ ter .
when I saw into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa absor@@ ber ) saw , I saw a Gu@@ er@@ ill@@ aker , who wrote something .
I had fear , com@@ for@@ ting , because besides him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ades , a deadly weapon in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dorn@@ ro@@ sch@@ en@@ schl@@ af &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said it nevertheless and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , therefore I reply to it . &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks .
I aw@@ ed him completely and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ades .
perhaps he was tired too , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . the F@@ ARC , was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now , I know that there is a society outside there that are open to us with open arms .
until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn a lot of things and work with dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
for the pre@@ l@@ ude came students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC to a panel round .
the students grew up in as war as war and the F@@ ARC participated in the dark .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years ago we have experienced how the social in@@ justice on the part of the state to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this order is worth overcome all the obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
those people who have never heard heard before and no voting right , and to realize that the people I have seen often seen as a mon@@ ster and even hate , even people with beautiful feelings were shot down through their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is living , hur@@ ting me sore .
but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to us can teach us something and can give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian@@ co was made that after the dra@@ in@@ age would rule peace .
but that is not the case .
as long as it is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call on all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrific@@ es , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ osex@@ ual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with terror activists have witn@@ essed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that just like a d@@ amo@@ is , does not depend on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only formed by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happens in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered international head@@ lines after several months ago , after reports have been published , which them@@ ed the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ ed .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she thre@@ w a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , who captured suspic@@ ious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have given a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew there .
since her childhood she has noticed that she was actually a woman in reality .
when they became growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ yan had experienced her land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sabrina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA .
Sabrina : I was acting as an hon@@ or@@ ary assistant on a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife who raised in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her with no hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who may remove these shame ? &quot;
after that , the pictures took from my documents through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was just doing a couple of shopping , from the back of my car , I heard a Male Extra saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned , I sens@@ ed something in my body , but I did nothing sore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you rep@@ el the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I know only that there was a young man , not a thirty years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently some women had got it all together and started to scre@@ am .
the man was flo@@ wn .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sample wo@@ unds in my right pul@@ mon@@ ary .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ance were you put - in the men or women of women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor was ver@@ able and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was able to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cas@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for he is respectful of me .
I spent more than one month in the hospital .
last February I got a threat .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that this was all a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it by talking without through the streets ; others wanted me in official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body size C - what should I say in TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke to my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world , not only your family , but the whole Republic .
we cannot st@@ ir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she placed himself a strike around the neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with a dark window sli@@ ces and a Num@@ ber@@ plate with a 95 .
having happened to the third time it was clear to me that was a bit la@@ zy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human rights @-@ friends aud@@ ited the number@@ ed signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how have you fled ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to give them a name , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something happened .
I still cannot understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering , without sign , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and check@@ out into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App I got a message : &quot; you believed in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you know . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but above the sex @-@ equation we do not speak , however , that is a tab@@ ular theme .
some traditional k@@ au@@ top@@ ical elements are still in me .
so much I wish to do it , these se@@ el@@ ic barrier can I not overcome .
I say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we ch@@ att@@ ing with a camera , I actually put a lot of effort to look like the person that she rec@@ alls from her past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ran@@ ked ?
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the necessary information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who took one and a half months in the gun .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all could hardly wait until the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &apos; honor &quot; experienced by blood gen@@ ug@@ ung .
OC Media : are also stuck in these secret results even now .
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it would not be very many .
if , then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are stored there so that they can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be brought in , one will show their bodies on television and claim it , they would have attacked something in your village or a military base .
understand ?
as if these people were not simply forced , but specifically sub@@ stit@@ ched to be radic@@ alised .
OC Media : is it now only a reference , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just imagine someone who was one and a half months in the gun .
he says that many people were gone to this prison after having grown up a beard .
there has been nothing new of them since then .
they have simply taken them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself involved as these people were with@@ drawn .
until now , however , it was not presented as a band@@ its , and there were no reports previously . we suggest that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise it would not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know , whether these persec@@ utions and ex@@ ts of people who belong to a so called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation to already be in the past ?
Sabrina : I have always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think it was already very big already in 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but ultimately has thrown back to the St@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this under the shar@@ ia law possible ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were satisfied ; I had colored eyelashes , carried m@@ tu@@ be@@ je@@ ans and short t@@ ops .
the security of the Sch@@ aria has never cur@@ ved me only a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that said , &quot; Sp@@ otto is not beyond the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when things are funny to the sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes to you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never before and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace hold on ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row replaced the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on TV about mor@@ als .
he did not speak about us , but rather on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change .
who had been sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed , viewed you on one time with suspic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic has ever wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I didn &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much .
otherwise I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ ups , together , I beg@@ le@@ ite them to the hospital and help them get Es@@ sen@@ sk@@ arten .
I have no cent for this .
I discovered these people themselves when I per@@ si@@ fied fe@@ eder .
I am Muslims and want those who need help .
OC Media : do you register by a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ ass@@ ing .
so nature is , that has purely nothing to do with religion .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to convert you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no thres@@ hold among them .
the Dag@@ est@@ an@@ ians have the ones who have the he@@ aders who have the Russians as well ; but on the entire planet it is - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I am from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims living in the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know , many think of tran@@ sist@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a trust .
these are two different things - two different ways of sens@@ ing to be exact , different habitats .
for me it is the most important to feel my own skin and not ash@@ amed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I will become so personally here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad about it . I just know that I am myself now .
local groups war@@ n of an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ids within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty @-@ rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered of anxiety among anxiety , depression , and he was ash@@ amed of his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come to the in@@ capacity for his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and will remain anonymous .
one at YouTube get@@ tes video gave the moments when he had described himself in@@ fi@@ red .
some people managed to delete the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists before the spot warned that even more men could take the life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights ruled that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - added .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who were hel@@ pl@@ ess and able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community located in Iran has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to ride its livel@@ i@@ hoods .
a century ago the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy the power took over and 1925 large efforts , to end the ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran in advance oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most prominent and most valuable areas of use for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population get only little of this ri@@ ches .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and austerity .
the Iranian regime refused to prosec@@ ute Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has built a variety of dem@@ ons , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dem@@ ons have only led to destro@@ ying the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry .
unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director@@ ate @-@ Director for Co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , 55 % a secondary school ended and 45 % a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with Residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ ality among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z new to the in@@ coming ethnic ri@@ ques and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
as function@@ aries and institutions pre@@ fers not fav@@ oured Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims at destro@@ ying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and forced them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside her home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first@@ - and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation on Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i and to be an@@ gled , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , because the speaking of Arab language or the wearing of Arab clothes .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , the human rights activists , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world becomes awake and aware of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identifying with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . article was the subject of several discussions on which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ fac@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put good scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ists and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women nowadays are still less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they must do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a gl@@ itter@@ ing ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and denomin@@ ations .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of that and I am suffering double and triple as well .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , on black tran@@ si@@ ous women , on black tran@@ si@@ sts women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; when I am talking about what kind of matter physically , se@@ el@@ astic and verbal ab@@ used , both inside and outside the femin@@ ist movement , let many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are silent .
however , however , they all agree that women - all women - to come together to up@@ lift their votes and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk that there is in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institu@@ tion@@ alised form of racial violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls will be transferred with a migration background out of the school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want to do all the women , all men and all individuals nor any skin colour of equal rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is up@@ set to consider in@@ just@@ ices in their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and I &apos;m not going to fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , who always rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner wo@@ unded 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; I &apos;m not a woman ? &quot; and I also wei@@ ght@@ less myself to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense .
I so@@ unded me , join me group@@ ings which are also absorbed through cultural an@@ ex@@ propri@@ ation to our customs and customs in order to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer attempt to try white women the importance of brac@@ ing skin colour and sex . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different arri@@ vals a home and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of myself full of femin@@ ism and enter the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that used for my dark skin and my status as women &apos;s life , instead of st@@ ating myself for a white femin@@ ist paradig@@ m which is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and lift us into the spher@@ es which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book afri@@ cana : about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves by changing our own way , where they are completely safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately retri@@ eve separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after having read these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement in which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ ist environment I can ascend to black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I existed .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and due to my existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life was neither b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ed nor ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling to pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by Tod@@ d Reu@@ b@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has been reported in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Agreement , this article will be released here again .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special request due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . its mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explained to us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of cont@@ amination on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from across the country are concerned that the decades of war , the construction of dam , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ government organisation Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance , committed to protecting rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work together : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia from Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq resident documentary film and multi@@ medi@@ al journ@@ alistic , produced , fil@@ med and published .
the focus of her work lies in temporary sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative video graphics and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities , their stories to tell in their way .
Paraguay ays Women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The cr@@ ying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents their pain on the women &apos;s wom@@ ens in the country and in the region and express their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ dish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ less ) who reported on the violence of violence towards women in Paraguay .
most names were subject to the protection of persons concerned .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ar said Ada B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their partner who might become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship was some time passed and the police said , her statement would be put to the acc@@ ents , but more could not do .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out for missions , also the ac@@ credited display of Ada B@@ Ã¡@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later the second wife moved her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
once women have shown an ad at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases the women are also financially dependent on the men who mis@@ use them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit , to be victims of violence , not at all in case @-@ law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 Schl@@ und and Statist@@ ic@@ en@@ 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ cellaneous and a judicial system that has nothing to be a non@@ imm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation l@@ es and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women truly are mist@@ aken , My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , but not even if sat@@ anic the scale of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the available figures are al@@ arm@@ ing .
in 2015 the district of 9@@ 600 ads left over because of domestic violence . at 70 % of this it went to violence against women .
86 % of the adver@@ ts in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertis@@ ements because of domestic violence at the peace juris@@ dictions . even here , 86 % of the display of women .
in the ads were 40 % of women that they were physically depos@@ ited , 55 % of women spoke of mental missions .
these statistics show however not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women ministers Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are actually shown only a few of these off@@ ences . &quot; to every woman , which will be re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of mental missions , 9 females do not do so .
to any woman who im@@ bur@@ sed because of physical missions , two women , who do not do this , &quot; stated end of 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since women &apos;s su@@ icide is not an own off@@ ence , the prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can not be adequ@@ ately documented as many women killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by August 2016 , journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country alone .
the Co@@ ordinator of human rights in Paraguay is at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days dies because of violence by men .

invisible missions and a judicial system that takes nothing to do
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she told him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she did not want this , but then after . this should she rep@@ ented them .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but two years ago she bore the psych@@ ic violence itself - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the har@@ dest recogni@@ zable :
I have never imagined that I would be victims of abuse .
if I have read earlier this , I always thought that only women are occurring because they are dec@@ eived of violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report about the missions through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ally whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they dropped so long by Carlos and not left him before .
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain in@@ noc@@ ence to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos that was not from Paraguay , was fought nearly eight years with authorities in Paraguay , in order to prove that its former partner has failed .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria case everything started with psych@@ ic missions .
their wealthy partner did not manage to convince them that it was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities were without a result and even from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against their former partners who developed into an un@@ en@@ viable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of missions is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen liz@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay , also provides major problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Parliament , a bill was discussed under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # FÃ¼r@@ s ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement of the Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law appears to explain femin@@ izi@@ de to a permanent imp@@ asse and to pun@@ ish , as in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
thus the legislative text was altered in some points , in order to also win the members of the law that feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be paved , currently in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had envis@@ aged , much of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) proc@@ ed@@ ural costs , who are currently wearing the victims of violence by themselves , if they only provide display and would like to get a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay it is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a circum@@ stance must take place , so that violence is no longer considered slightly Nor@@ mal .
who@@ ever occurs in the face of this facts , does not guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to refund so long ad until missions are no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , but , among other things , a passage of time has been painted , that the partners in cases of domestic violence have risen to reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law applies as a great return . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to be exposed to a paper to ban an paper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been blocked due to a decision of the information of the Information Secretary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the Az@@ am@@ n homepage on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bot@@ her@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago the om@@ anic authorities have concluded the independent Arabic magazine Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was sentenced to one year old prison .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put before judgment , however , came again free .
O@@ man has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a State set .
since then , he died , besides his role as the sole Sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : prime minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Defence , Minister of Finance , Minister of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public freedom , including freedom of freedom , and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ gg@@ ers and other activists , too shy and det@@ ained .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , to express their views on public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure , and the det@@ ention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since founded in 2007 about corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces gave I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , a article titled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; had appeared in the judiciary in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report the governmental authority , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man , have been under pressure to set a judgment in an inher@@ it dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was charged Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , from the ISS prior to the special department and placed upon his arrival from the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had an editor @-@ in @-@ chief editor , who had been editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the newspaper was closed down to a certain period after the Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial began in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court condemned the three journalists to prison guards and ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned both of a disorder in the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty about the violation of an audience of audience and guilty for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year pen@@ alties and banknotes at the height of 3000 of each 3000 ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year profession was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was condemned to a year prison and fine fine in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after using &quot; a dissemin@@ ator to spread material that could represent a threat to public order &quot; for guilty .
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit was arrested in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to jud@@ gement from the imprisonment .
the Court of Appe@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i said in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dism@@ issed on 10 April 2017 and was dism@@ issed on 10 April 2017 . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was f@@ law@@ ed his one @-@ year sentence .
the Court of Appe@@ al also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January the information is appointed a statement , with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information ministers personally signed another statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the minister introduced itself against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to present the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only ones in which in O@@ man in recent times the press freedom has been viol@@ ated .
for more injury , for example , include the closing of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation .
due to the ongoing ter@@ mination of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists of their work can follow .
3 . protect press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can exercise their right human rights work , and without fear of fail@@ ures , including judicial barriers , can exercise .

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing section that addressed the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that have special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria have considerable effects in the poorest countries in Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem .
secondly , research which is carried out by African scientists themselves , in building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is Director of the Centre for research on infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first pointed out the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself reli@@ ed on HIV virus as he decided to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ ler health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and the confusion of the media through these research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er speaks as a private ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : right now lies the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the s@@ amb@@ ental national programme for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with laboratory testing .
in addition , I had just a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s .
G@@ V : what do you think are the important topics of science in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only set up solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being M@@ acher instead of yourself .
the solutions that we get are often un@@ usable in our environment and sometimes it &apos;s even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research that you had not had previously ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratories is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa facing western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the complicated access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers gain global food production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bre@@ d since the 1980s in the United States .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NAS@@ A @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in the space and consumed .
in almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work became only through his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many Sal@@ at@@ ters can get there .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he re@@ marked that more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented and that he was not able to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resi@@ li@@ ency against diseases , a special red or green , or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered in more plants such as cere@@ als or cardboard sites . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned for food security around the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia , Mort@@ on has become more and more sal@@ ads , but it is now longer necessary since his work is getting more and more limitations .
&quot; it &apos;s like to lie in a river a rock , in order to cut down the p@@ addle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that , but it is a break with the far@@ med tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far towards Sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they set before judgment , nobody can breed any more a new sal@@ at@@ sor@@ te because all features already pat@@ ented . &quot; he does so well and tried to cut out those features he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ ti@@ ous and makes every effort to use any material which is protected as a intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS , red Roman sal@@ at of Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station has been bre@@ d and eaten there . there will be tested whether plants grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software .
it was called into being to make sure that some plants and causes are not protected as intellectu@@ als and are permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US bre@@ eder can agree that others can use them freely and freely use them freely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to business with their seeds and buy it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not allow anyone to buy seeds , to breeding it , and not immediately so@@ w it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ente . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si , manager Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in larger associations , such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance capacity .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified crops .
all kinds of plants could be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the increasingly popular mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as for example , in August or September 2016 . &quot; who is good , locally and sustainable produced vegetables , should also know that the way in which vegetables is bre@@ d , is threatened .
nutr@@ ition@@ ism without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will continue to provide assistance with other seeds , as opposed to them , to patent seeds and plant @-@ characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies are com@@ promised , since the available gene @-@ pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which thus was always restricted to un@@ bo@@ unded .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive manager of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ toral work with gen@@ et@@ ischer variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found that about a third of all cardboard is protected as a intellectual property , making it available for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants there is such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ built plants such as past@@ ries are pat@@ ented in a bigger style than salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of reflec@@ tions
plants are bre@@ d so that they have targeted reasonable characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such because of which they ste@@ er in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available pest@@ ici@@ des for bre@@ eders are decre@@ asing by more and more patents . genetic diversity is now necessary , but ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse pre@@ predic@@ table .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four gen@@ itals and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture of the United States , the company dedicated itself to the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property is related to other bre@@ eders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of pest@@ ici@@ des innovations promote &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan to which everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to reach the same result with another method .
such protection does not in@@ hibit innovation , but supports them by being made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years waiting to wait until a patent expi@@ res , and certainly no innovations .
and if you wait for such a long time to breed , to breed plants , which are adapted to the modified environment conditions , would have been lost the battle already .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers ease their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t keep using the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a whole , Mort@@ on seems to be pat@@ ented on the concept , plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eder we have finally no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant @-@ in in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si government member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish , also bre@@ d its own values into it .
who@@ ever believes in industrial agriculture involving large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for the cultivation of her@@ b@@ zi@@ de cultivation , bre@@ d in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly a piece of GM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some moderate @-@ sized companies ( such that are moving on international markets but smaller than B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , manage to survive most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either strictly refuse it or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for in his breeding @-@ garden Sal@@ ads .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant pat@@ ches would be innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that pat@@ ented .
I need a constantly new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors are selling my sorts in a couple of years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , so that in my opinion one simply makes it pretty easy . &quot;
although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program works the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country , present to the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . in this case , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent system that allows patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; it is now on governments of the Member States to bring the post office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the sponsor@@ ing of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently running a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for the plan to fall next year of the official start of the official start .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database of seeds and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seeds map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating - a group of aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report . in this she represents the opportunity to come to seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policies to ensure stable supply with food .
in the report , the importance of diverse , local supply is empha@@ sized for sustainable food and ecos@@ ystems - a connection to the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that they will soon be able to recognize more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly taken place where and how something is grown , and seed systems are hardly played , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest objectives of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government sent the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that .
August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities approved for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information ab@@ id@@ - despite this attack and the sw@@ aying of Egypt &apos;s right and constitution by the authorities , which the law should not defend their objective to un@@ cover up freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the block@@ age and not to follow . we insist that our task is to fulfill .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first @-@ being website of an human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities referred to more than two months 21 websites , such as b@@ link the independent news page MA@@ DA mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the from Qatar @-@ sham@@ eful network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the Colum@@ ni@@ sten and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada does not have access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spreading of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he does not write in Egypt &apos;s websites and media .
now , the blog , which he set up in order to b@@ yp@@ ass the c@@ ens@@ ities of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the provider where also a newspaper blog is native , however , it is available on the other hand .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he reported on Egyptian security guards in December 2013 , while he reported on the Stud@@ enten@@ protests and a video took place , such as the police of bodily violence against two students .
his article mainly turn to politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook Comm@@ entary , Zi@@ ada devoted to the block@@ age through the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege condition ; a det@@ ention , a ver@@ tically murder , un@@ loading of the national Security Council , the block@@ age blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I wrote not in vain . in other words : my words have an influence , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to deal with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
now however , after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ick@@ and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this erg@@ ing technical tests in the networks of different Internet Service Provider ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors , by revers@@ ing of dormit@@ ory and private Sur@@ fing was possible , so called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( V@@ PN@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , 12 June , we noticed how to offer the block@@ age of websites that began V@@ PN@@ s .
such practice points to the intention of the government to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will additionally be wast@@ ed that the c@@ ens@@ orial decisions made behind closed doors , thereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers in whole Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old school , &quot; said every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke with military weapons , &quot; President Tem@@ pio sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Navy and Lu@@ cas@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the Non@@ wave 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian @-@ government organisation Global Justice called for even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , ro@@ b , sex break , etc . all that happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes off the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , declared Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
extra is probably the only newspaper throughout the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 countries that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the article article the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if he is dist@@ orted , can also be used to hide from the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and their partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sch@@ a@@ det the name &quot; War &quot; more than they are useful ?
in an article on the message portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil was argu@@ ing the journalist as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility with the police .
this is not war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as we have shown extra in the analysis of military installations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suff@@ ic@@ neg@@ lect to neg@@ lect public service .
to memory : the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ ia is false : &quot; 22 of 30 violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest data available .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the rates rates per federal state , Rio at position 16 , &quot; writes it .
specially belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , that empha@@ sizes such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , since years the security of the state repeated .
on these safety policies also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal states of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to con@@ quer a massive police pot a F@@ av@@ ela to con@@ quer a unit permanently .
in the beginning this led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP had to protect , however , according to several reports on decre@@ ases and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit , which is increasingly under bom@@ bing .
on its Facebook page cited the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not set the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war has a serious consequences for the people after themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to act , means and ways which are typical for a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the penetration in the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irrit@@ ated balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war hin or her , Fak@@ t is that the inhabitants of F@@ av@@ elin continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to coun@@ cils the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident took place : a orch@@ er died as a result of shots , who had spot@@ ted the police from a helic@@ opter .

since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ade , mainly through the Assad regime towards lo@@ y@@ ale troops .
according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organisation PA@@ X and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Di@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly strongly affected is the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where a attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that , on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the mass@@ ac@@ re @-@ regime has been pract@@ ised by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those of the rebels have controlled controlled territories outside Damascus , which resulted in local people to rely on local or through tunn@@ els and control points ;
through the years of long block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat become in@@ accessible to large parts of the population .
in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics also teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional , in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , your food is an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Dire@@ kt of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i , because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that have been campa@@ ign@@ ing for three years to announce this project and gets its relief that it gains more and more &apos; of famili@@ arity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take a nut@@ shell in consultation with the NGO gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to the plant@@ ing of fung@@ i , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue until Monday , 04 . September 2017 , will continue to raise donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative depends on generators , which maintain the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of fuel fuel , locally produced fuel , plastic materials are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of from the regions origin@@ ating from the regions , before they aud@@ ition@@ ed their quality and if they are suitable for consumption .
subsequently they planted a small mush@@ room in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger bathtub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after three months , they have distributed rooms everywhere in the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the pilgrimage for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fraction of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee add@@ itive , cardboard , etc ) are used for extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
he said , &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on October 21st in many district towns in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that took place in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
forty people died and approximately 70 were wo@@ unded by the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government was last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a state str@@ atum .
fires were also registered in the region of G@@ ali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ works , which spread in the north and centrally located regions of the country , and about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages reached .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande it occurred a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths as well as 200 pen@@ dents .
according to the European forest surveillance system that supervis@@ es the forest areas via satellite shots , alone 2017 in Portugal is about 500@@ ,000 acres of forest burned in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon area .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst &apos;s position : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the call for better pre@@ venti@@ v@@ - and fire surveillance measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to d@@ ash@@ amed the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the Bund of the farmers of Portugal said the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o the streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
that Sunday they did not put this nowhere : there are d@@ utz@@ end@@ ent reports of open roads that surround by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in loc@@ alities with high bran@@ dr@@ is are question@@ ed .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was held by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government carried out a lo@@ osing of the law which did not allow the applic@@ ant to act by means of self @-@ protection if the applic@@ ant could be built about resources for self @-@ protection if the applic@@ ant could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leads JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees from slightly com@@ bust@@ ion of wood , itself , like in a devil @-@ circle , according to the fires of this kind continue to spread .

it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : they used their own civilian data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire brig@@ ade and was so bu@@ zz@@ ing that the servers persec@@ uted by the 400@@ ,000 users who kept the fires followed , do not with@@ held the site more than half a million migrants .

during a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in divisions , which had defeated the short@@ ened pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was to a land of terror and despair .
just at that time A@@ mo@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ar@@ ah , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Europe , last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time so she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick it up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ara &apos;s leader of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ soldier was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many ha@@ ara felt immediately vulnerable .
the Taliban ru@@ ined for their hat@@ red on the ou@@ ara was ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ mo@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a few years in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and tow bags with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
at that time as today the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran is dominated by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded of A@@ mo@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we paid n@@ ylon from the open windows so we can not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ hi@@ ber@@ nation had his life without papers in Iran and made them ready for travel to Europe .
in the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected its asylum order , A@@ hi@@ de@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time ago , A@@ hi@@ af was homeless , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day for the need@@ y people .
though it is true that Italy is due to relative high level rates , a kind of second chance for the asylum seek@@ ers is . it &apos;s also true that the conditions that you find asylum seek@@ ers in the country is cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ation Union for Europe is writing , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suff@@ ers under a general shortage of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personal staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can be assigned only to an acceptance center , if officially they have officially placed an application for asylum - which can go down after the registration of the asylum process still monthly .
until then , people who have no money for an accommodation either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so there is also A@@ hi@@ af .
but his imm@@ ac@@ eful lust of life helped inv@@ ali@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years in construction industry , A@@ hi@@ ber@@ nation had raised its entire savings in the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that he opened after a while still a second hostel and a sn@@ out bite .
A@@ mo@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is Succ@@ ess Story is now on the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award , the 2017 for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , some 20,000 people are living in Italy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past few years , some of Afghanistan have been developed , among them tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and staff are among the most part refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells of the different af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua , the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals are however very far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my land and I cannot live happ@@ ily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest countries in the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and need to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af will also decor@@ ate plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ ative techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest from the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ hi@@ af did this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislative dis@@ cards from Egypt allow shut@@ down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in cust@@ ody .
he re@@ counted on the clear@@ ance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which protest@@ ed against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenge , vic@@ tories and upcoming trends in worldwide Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament checks a bill on which users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users would have to use their social networks within six months , after the most successful law on the website of the authority under information of their complete name as well as its exp@@ ul@@ sion number . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who@@ ever failed that step could be sentenced to 6 months of imprisonment or tri@@ bute to a criminal law .
the law , which was applied by six@@ ty female members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the parliament and will be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may a further dep@@ uty policy should be introduced to the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the alleg@@ ation of the President and a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyp@@ t@@ isches Law , the insul@@ ting of the president as well as nation@@ ally institutions are already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the legislative proposal , such an act would be suspected with pris@@ ons and banknotes , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while violence demonstrated against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who fought against the military coup d Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited for more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in jail at a court appearance .
recently , his hear@@ ings was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison @-@ line according to human rights groups refused to bring the accused by the prison in the court of court .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty on account , so many human rights groups agree , dis@@ bur@@ dens of e.g. arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and ad@@ dic@@ tive murder .
in another case a criminal court said in Giza the two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists , who sounds too sc@@ anned documents
Mai spent Tunis@@ ian authorities six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was primarily contrac@@ ted by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly endor@@ sed a controversial law , the busin@@ ess@@ men and during the former regime by the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption compl@@ ained Am@@ nest@@ y , provided that all of these un@@ law@@ ful funds will be ref@@ unded .
which published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at document , thro@@ ws a light on how pro@@ vision@@ ing plans look like to support the law .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia bor@@ rowed the disclosure of his sources by article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he stood at the District Court in Tunis , on May 09 , as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their reference ?
according to new regulations for the state office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to permit or share news in social media .
in accordance with the regulations , the registration will be required with the full representative name .
analy@@ st susp@@ ect that the elimination of anonymous comments in sub@@ stitu@@ tions within social networks shall be reached . it is still unclear how the authorities can apply these rules .
Chinese dealers have proposed in social media to sel@@ ective these provisions only to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and its independence .
can we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
Mai joined the state c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Russia to access the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ ed@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat , to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the Information Society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this design@@ ation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government manages a list of online services , which will organise the &quot; release of the information . &quot; the law permits the government to make responsible services responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
on these websites are currently websites like V@@ kontak@@ te and od@@ no@@ klass@@ niki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru , and the use of other services .
Turkish Court incorpor@@ ating Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the block@@ age Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to clear two English @-@ speaking articles that support Turkey , the ji@@ ha@@ dists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication have been blocked because it has been locked into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information source that works with groups to engage in a political diff@@ usion in Turkey against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey blocks the website completely . it is , in addition to e.g. China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
