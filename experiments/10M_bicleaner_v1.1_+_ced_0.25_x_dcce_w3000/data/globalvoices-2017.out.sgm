<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have been dancing to American music, American writers read and run its sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a great profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American Film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-Studentin who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnates, who wanted to confess the Supreme Bundesplatz with Richtern who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "it was like that the absolute truth is, everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting, that you can always be the one who you are, and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very darkish love of about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his Engdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latino, African American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won at the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number given by the party of nominate candidat ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigote person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to reconcile Trump and its voters with the people I had learned during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Such as my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist, the people from all over the world gather, a deep-believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also consented trumps world view not by Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," fact.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had arrived in our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sun" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intence is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced during Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life for the environment and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits with the dedication of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the through them embodiments my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While wearing his way to the nominee Republican Presidents, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt compared to non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people have voted for wearing because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, one of my friends, is exactly what led to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities do not take into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of whom are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this United States they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who look different with contempt for those who look differently from it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(mt.):" "" "acts of the whites against all other ethnicities" "", "wordplay from black into play on the whites and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones called, has made exactly what America has done so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one can always have, America is everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose his president, twice the son of Kenycle, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice Donald Trumpy there is a vast part of the white America of this promise, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas, after 9 / 11 the white man is again in the ruder, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a vocabulary with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The amount answered with a strong "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the amount.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latino a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "replied them." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they were calling and their votes have been louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received an unanimous and onomous" "" "sound" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "God is thanks to Mr. Trump, that is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was reported." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumpy's land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look as Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school in the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played in both places not only has changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with you...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is popular among tourists, but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now La Banda de música (music bande) plays in the church: one of the children and an adult Symphonie orchestras, which has found a way to overcoming them surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is central to the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The parish, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexikos, is known for its drugs misuse and banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth were thus a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come and play with shiny eyes and play in the excitement you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Müll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village which lies practically at the greatest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made from re-selling waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recursively instruments that consist of local solid waste material, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura, where the recycling led by Favio Chávez in order to transform parts of the crash into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cuelli, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teaches the children of Cateura, at the early times:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio was something that he had never seen before: one out of waste is out.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra, playing on instruments based on instruments and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill harmonic" (harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world creates more than one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and live with him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follow the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Orchestra has played his music before the Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successful against illegal fishing</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was known that this ship had already been operated in liberian waters of illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore disled and little patched to welcome a legislative burglars of this species on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized itself swiftly against the ship. they lingering him one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship's time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia because of pillage of the country's stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">At the core of this initiative, the criminal practices undercrossed and resources protects, however-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 from the NRO stop illegal Fishing (Illegale Fisheries) founded.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries, who had sold the prime minister out of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project are illegal fishing. this project provides non-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because of it extremely difficult to absorb. so that's illegal fishing is a main matter of overfishing regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the intentional disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that a delikates balance have.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail with the information between individual countries, so events happen today in real time, with traceable on the-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists, news about suspicious activities or details that one has noticed or experienced during a port spection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea, by means of satellite.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships known in forbidden areas. also, such divulged bicycles can be discovered - some such that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fish-licence, where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse on the basis of such information then adopting such ships in their ports. what does the ships do not sell their cargo. and that they could even be forced to pay for penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about significant financial loss for the owners, which means the illegal fishing catch is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also assists'i-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to recover from 20 million USD in abandoned sales, which will lose eight members of the network of HISH-i every year due to the illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing, present to the region's commercial fishing from around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices such as actions include as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing paper, indication of Phantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and take the weaknesses of a non-sufficient control system," "" "says Long." "" "before a ship was illegal fishing and a country could then say 'You darker my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">Yet another country could say 'comm to me'. "and this very legale cornerstone tries to close-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, Brei was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks covering the fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and found it fleeing ships tracked and found.</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps those illegal ships have to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which deals with fisheries data and does" "" "non-i technical support" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on their automated identification systems, so that they can no longer be stored by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that combines different information levels with each other. it should help however, discriminatory ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But, Game-i's team can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by means of the position of each individual ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "inventing with the neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - that gives simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to combine themselves and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>

<seg id="142">There are signs that age-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also terrify them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Boats which previously had without license confiscated and hardly to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in the-i-participating countries took a 33% increase in fisheries policy, since fishing boats more licenses buy.</seg>

<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As now an adult man told Quijano as part of the great La Perla Ribera in the province of Córdoba and his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, the same name as his father to carry out to the brutal Militäroperations in the prison of La Perla, he watched it in the age of 15.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family preoccupation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinean Military Intelligence between 1974 and 1983, was his father of statesdeur of Intelligence 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo, and urged me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="220">You are a nostril, you made you friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Passport only indicates that they will not escape one day and then I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército -cionario del Pueblo, - revolutionaries Volksarmee - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party in Argentina.</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my Father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times in La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he took me, to rise. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little wrapped out of wrinkles and commanded me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a large clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On this day I went to the other end of the Baracke, where the stolen objects were put down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out on an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Since they are practicing the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spying, and saw a couch on which people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and a metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later, I found out that it was attached to it by the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lodged straight there.</seg>

<seg id="362">In the prefecture of Kyoto, for example, in 2005 1.941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overturn one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in mind language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - mother language.</seg>
<seg id="379">Thus, a French womb should be translating from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ associates with English as a mother tongue, to translate the translations into English. this may result in error-understanding of the surviving, cost-reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, to be attributed to Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who even have no foreign staff, release translations nevertheless company-internally. then the Japanese worker, whose English skills are considered to be the best for translator - regardless of how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The transluous and puzzling phrases caused by machine translation, show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human translator for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling-prints which often decorate T-Shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr and Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors are acceptable or acceptable, or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">In future the city of Kyoto uses a serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of the Iraq, Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq began to protect the spiritual Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopard, which runs through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). overall there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of its habitat, and since they are getting less loot, at risk.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza showing in the video, "the Persian Leopard the only remaining beast of the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big robtier is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore poses that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera all, breaks Raza in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">Being trained Biologin shows Raza passionate like a different side of their country, which is not just out of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">It has been involved in fieldstudies on wild animals living and educational programs from nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the continued daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made during the past six years to rebuild the lives of those that were affected by the "Trinity disaster" of March 2011. a vast earthquake, tsunami and an atom-accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. prefecture of Miyagi was a misprefecture of prefecture to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbourhood of Fukushima and Iwate have been forced maracuated, because the tsunami had vanished whole coastal cities off the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Again, the prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, even alone therefore 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows what progress has been achieved after six years to rebuild the lives of local communities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese reconstruction agency as well as survey results of the affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential structure in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-newspaper reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (the balance is the one, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures could award Miyagi, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas the Fukushima is 70 percent closure.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, we still strive for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by shelters (the individual, the other, kasetsu juutaku) into final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe nearly 80 thousand people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36 000 people lived from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such cases.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in emergencies. more than 75 percent of the evacuated prices, which after the disaster in Behalry accommodation, were converted into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures:</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the bourgeoisie, opened their doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">"" "" "" "six years later, there is much more difficult industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures." ""</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fisheries port in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation again, in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishing marinas have resumed its operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have been milded in the three prefectures of agriculturally in co-passionately.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, only 66 percent of the agricultural land of Iwate and less than 50 percent of agricultural land in Fukushima can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fall, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares was destroyed of Fukushima, lying in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered over again, but here Fukushima still remains far down.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back up to 90 percent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, it can only be 75 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also tells that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal community, it is harder to make themselves earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to obtain a full picture, the newspaper resulted in many questionings among the native population and among the evacuated nations. they asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sensations have changed in relation to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of the local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of the respondents, that still have not been done enough in disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it comes to those who had to be evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has focused their attention on the situation of the evacuated energies of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessed the worst, catastrophism, nuclear accidents, the Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 Evacuated by Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were imposed in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 something was more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophy areas, most of the evacuation areas are still in Behel-shelters, older than 50 years old. they must compete in proper Behaviagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive building projects. this is building projects, the part of the Olympic Games will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences appear to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one recognizes that more than it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is very small but very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look carefully these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices that remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek culture; Violeta Camarasa still reminding the love of music the lack of common language knowledge during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar beech factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the decreasing the sugar industry rose still in the region, and the factory was lost, and after its installations, until only the scaffold of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes rarely the work.</seg>

<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls precisely that in Mañalich would have obtained the sugar factory, but the promise has not been kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar beech industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administration choices and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 the production reduced 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced Quantity.</seg>

<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban sugar beech rose?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the municipality saw already better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar beech industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar bees were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production facility amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce the sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugars on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain a pound, according to the 2016 report, "agricultural spectives" by the OECD and FAO, the Economic and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would achieve the level of 2001 (3,6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would manage roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">The following years, the stagnation of a total of 98 sugar factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar rohrfabrik Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez since 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closing of the factory, is the word he is most repeated, "betrayal."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion, not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place is maintained, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">In the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recognised documents that were removed only with regard to the parts which would be removed, the addresat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any discharge.</seg>
<seg id="663">From there the responsibility was overcast and the letters have always been more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and other important work producers has been erased.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of the First Nations Communities across Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them. they do this by Hip Hop, thanks to a range of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour has been contributing direct to schools and youth centres, to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio- and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North Quebec with ten Cree-Communities and then worked with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop takes up that the young participants in talks topics like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance, or whatever in mind comes up.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Since the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitopcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the Highway of the Highway 16, a road-section in Westkanada, at the nearly two dozen most cases indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video games to arranging how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences from globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youth control the languages of the First Nations not always mutualism.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have started, the refrain is sung to Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group, which gave them a Strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree lieh.</seg>
<seg id="704">At the Facebookpage from N'we Jinan is at disposal the Strophe in Umschrift, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me.</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you'll take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">They can grow and lead to our youth in just as far as our youth.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show the potential customers what exactly on the menu is, are located near the entrance shokuhin rolling puru (the individual of the dishes, "Plastic models of dishes") from every food, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers watch these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those sculptural dishes that were documented by the German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most of the Japanese people these plastic dishes are so usually that they are not even more striving to them. however, a new trend is transformed into spliced mobile accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>

<seg id="729">In this case, a kaans-don (a popular tour with seafood) turned into a cell sign.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile-stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo's railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to see such an apple with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing aponment into strange.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some phone-struts and phone-designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon will be used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetite form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile-stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="753">"" "therefore, the Mexican news portals is the digital project" "" "Apral a Vivir Con El Narco" "" "(German:" "" "with drug dealers living" "" ") to give these sacrifices a voice and tells stories of people working in the battle between criminal enforcement authorities and cartels."

<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>

<seg id="759">A video with the title "vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Apral a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who tackle fear. we have to demonstrate the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk gentiles.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reading from Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution will remind us that violence should never be viewed as normal, no matter what shape it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known this disease for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to time schedules and see the page-pages with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or other types of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is intimately or sad. it affects like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">You write further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks that he will be Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of criminal offences when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that is, when they scries those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in one statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inessness of man is incredible to me if the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighboured place are so justified that they were settled. "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to speak that they are spared of such tragedies, if they are not touching and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months revival in the capital city district." therein, it describes how armed crimes spent for month money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business, but also had to demolished her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain in it never passes, the trauma remains high when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also have changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are away, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">They lock her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they will cause you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, whether wines would solve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answers is no, because I forgot how one cries. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega released the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the dangerous city of Mexikos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a commodity, and he tells himself that he cooks to himself, how to make a egg, potatoes broth, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the rivers with water, sugar and dairy powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg, one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the lives of violence, and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, one told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years ago when he was just a few blocks from his home, the bloody awche of his father saw that were shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of the murder of civil security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are still living in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we should not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprila Vivir Con El Narco" has launched an Animal Político Project, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug dealers, which has been tortured in the last four decades, in a more understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the armrests point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeries and the attempt of the Boko Haram, to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerge from the DR Congo again, when it was proven itself as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>

<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar Government published a position regarding what it was considered "purposeful news and photos, international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstandings in Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was made as evidence of the massacre of the Boko Haram 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retweetet), but the messages that were associated with it were raised in no religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that follow these Posts. the first frame focussed on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to larger discussions about the silence in the context of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the murder of the Rohingyas of Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion want to understand and the value human life is both important. therefore it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images no longer faith.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who accidentally believe the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggested that atmosphere of mis- and falsehood, that actual atrocities committed untrue and narrow it the real Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of extensive images has already been discussed in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the withholding of images of a refusal equals, the tragedy can be discerned. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent pictures readers and spectators desensitize and give them the ability to empathy (for example, this study, who sought how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is some of a lot of regard to extensive depictions in the news media, it is fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Techniologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "" "" Fake News "" "." you'll have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests a somewhat of what actually can be dissolved from the context or on completely misuse nature. "" "</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e. g. replaceable) attempts to provide language fans from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in any language: they express certain situations or feelings often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unmatched words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish just bred).</seg>

<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant to be meant by that.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words were already collected quite a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, whereas the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find example words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu like:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Bemate you for your parents in recognition of how to try you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>

<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity, here and now despite having a language barrier to contact someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the recognition of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about a different initiative of Steven Bird, the unrealisable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">However, here the focus of TLS is not written on the written form, but on the spoken word. it is a try to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major towns.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne, and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS had been carried out since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages do not get shared there for children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that must accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to feed in.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listen often often related to understanding" "" "forced these events instead" "" "listening to cherish, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers form their history first in their own language and translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation makes it possible to listen to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">For example, the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which tells in the language Dafing. during this turn, the storytale Rassidatou conate also shows the opportunity to explain the customs of the narrative of the narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of hoses and the whore in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">Having declared the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is that to speak to an audience that your language does not understand?" with a broad ditch he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">And they were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all that are inspired by the project can contact TLS in order to arrange their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and here is licence-free, contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are being built and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designer, developers, researchers and authors who have participated in the movements for free knowledge, have side to side to look over the mists who gives our newsfeeds and to create something meaningful from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved internet volunteers, who has been incarcerated since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled out of the directory of Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>

<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Kollektive remembering gives his friends and his family a voice that pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and indeed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us start to reflect on their own fates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">Why have we chosen?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from time to time?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The WebDeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in the imprisonment of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown village.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Ombudsperson Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police officer was based on a" severely secretly "commandments of the military courts from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as an insider on Assad's government and taken note of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, techniologist and currently overaccess the ladder of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the granting cultural Prototype predicted the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the elimination of numerous civilizations and in the Greek-Roman architecture of Greek architectural features with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would do everything to embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, Bassel could not yet close this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life so that freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call for his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English at, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has shared his knowledge with each who asked. he has taught other incarnations to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate for technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also brought other incarnations how they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the writer of Waiting (waiting), a prosabel which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for a year.</seg>

<seg id="1250">By 2016, since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrian.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambicans reacted with anger on a corruptive loss, where a governor returned after half of his sentence returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, by which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza that arrested in 2008 and 2010 together with four other defendants due to suspicion of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros) sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money originates from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza is in between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately called for his reinstatement in the company, which happened on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion in the prosecutor's prosecution, the Republic accepts the application, there would be no barriers to Cambaza to resume its old posts as the company had no disciplined proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens are not doing this action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade pública, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle and the decision of the company to reproduce the director.</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a proposal in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a relay with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplined against the state-resistance.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company seems obvious, however, and does not result in adequate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambian social media, reject this behavior as well and look at the case as' refute ':</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza is a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a sentence and half the half had to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could give advice and up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has awakened to be integrated into the company he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistant!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambicans and Student der Political Science in Brazil says, the Director possessed no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he won't offend it, I can't believe anyone in such a way, that the state has already acted so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals to return and serve the state, * he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead, has only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state, as handouts made it an inexhaustible money source, and the state itself has become tired, which was unloaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because it enthused the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word still is discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin, or in general as an adjective 'indically.</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "faccensored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "a" "" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of the Hassan in Burma in Burma." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements gave the word an extremely remote connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists than hate speech against Muslims, who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight-speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">Indeed, 'Kalar' is usually associated with racism but the word itself does not automatically calls to Hassan.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several burmesan words with basic meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair will also be written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (late), 'Kalar oat' (Kamel) or'kalarkaar. (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a rich way, whether they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a word of a word.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the Frageword (la) on Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that it will reduce Hassan radically nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook analyzes its purpose, before there will be any postcards that ignites in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook löscht the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatismus will not understand what you write on Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar Pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread the Hassan, have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminate Hassan, may not keep the efficiency of this strategy for long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of perceights are often a catch- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are to start to use a new word or alternative descripts of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Kaung Myat described how Facebook has started to clear his posts when he wanted to communicate with his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and me, the Liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours is prohibited, because the post of the Facebook Community standards did not escape. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to portray their opinions against Hassan radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask questions:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To shave such words will only get more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems that they have started without local context or technical support and have forbidden words like "chair" or "hersencurry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsible postings.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they could have more respect for the 15 million benefits, that would adopt a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks auto censorship has supplied with users for much clearance amongst users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make themselves funny and deliberately set the word 'Kalar' not within the context of Hassan, to see if their posters will be taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook-Posts, which did not show combo language, but nevertheless you have been removed.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically seated internet users are used to use detecting tools for block-block websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been appalled from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society an der Harvard University has been signed, regular blockages of the Internet has been adopted since 2007, after the Internet law (no. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the most known country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked there are now several mirrorsides (sites that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform installed all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-Peer-network (i.e. calculators) which is not based on the domain name and makes it difficult to make a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports on his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (via the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and shared manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia-content even if they cannot achieve the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also gave that this step is independent from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consagi by Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirror page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to bring similar levels of mirrors, when in the country Wikipedia Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Essentially the server controls the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini was shown in her discussion, was of women who do not name her husband.</seg>

<seg id="1486">A woman who does not withhold this is seen as a sharply, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition has been so deeply rooted, that we have never thought up to this panel.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband until now, at home, trying out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion about her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>

<seg id="1492">Prakash my husband, turned to me and said, I solder him from now on with his name.</seg>

<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands about the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra on the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women must never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>

<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient brook, the women decided that they actually try at home to call their husbands with their name.</seg>

<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she placed the women in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>

<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of your own closselection, morals connected to the saris and much more, shmuggelte Rohini its own couple of Kurtas (Upper hemden) into a panel discussion, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether in the five months since their first discussion, it has changed a little, the Rohini, that things slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband to say.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands. only one or two women are now wearing zinc-red on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to reach in their lives - like the fuse of more freedom of movement or their own closet - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1539">"" "each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu became sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk), after having taken part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that has been calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state on the international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shangrgam should be seen as a town in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the lawyers of the State of New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it is compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He is support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice, "to turn the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, according to all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one does not hear that we are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape in front of the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my land, what country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shangrgam led reasons were not very posh: it did not defend an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that it was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defends the idea that Singapore will be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the topic, the good old lyre from the authoritarian machines, which prevailed to be the Democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, last week of Shangrgam gave answers to his US guests in regard to our press, our judicated, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions must be tarmac with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shangrgam to illustrate his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful when our werter K Shangrgam would take on the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid to be part of the city's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By placing his comment on the blog, he points to reviews that you should begin to read the entire contributors of the conference to understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam better, according to which Singapore a city is and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "said why the elections in Singapore were so incomparative, even if we were looking forward to free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He was engaged in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party in a decade?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore," "" "is not a country" "", "he obviously does not have it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam, who as leaders of a growing generation, such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice has said, very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old garment, what I expect - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of the political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he truly believes what is really being associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the weaknesses of Shangrgams Argumenten:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shangrgam" "" "benign" "" "made a mistake" "" "or was it a friend" "" "mischief" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country leave the sovereign rights of the city Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both the country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"" "" "" "as he plays an important role within the module, the statements of Mr. Shangrgam is of serious importance." ""</seg>

<seg id="1725">Whom do our Prime Minister have to pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink recruitment?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the residents of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">To record the magazine Journey of a decade to the affirmation, Singapore, and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have become much more expensive...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "defense of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite true." ""</seg>

<seg id="1740">Your answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, revealed to the rumors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another facet.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," I answered. "I come from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered to show an interest in his conversation by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">Then my clarifications then follows the standard answers: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians boil perhaps inwardly in front of anger when they are held for Americans, but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that differs us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a canadic flag well visible in their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadian.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however...</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Trump, before the march in Iraq and before 11 September.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always taken small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their american neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care!</seg>
<seg id="1753">With us there are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Equal marriages are legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is supposed to be said to be the tolerant country against ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We canadier are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends, which I admired.</seg>
<seg id="1763">I wouldn't make me anything if you would like to examine me with Johnny from Dallas.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First of all, called "nice" to be called "nice" to be bad - just as the good-natured, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure of Ned Flanders from "Die Simpson" (who has an own Canadian double).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada has really been a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Negligible, means to be unconspicuous and uninteresting and have no attention to earn.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if one doesn't want to stop in the background, away from the things that happen around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even come as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone, a main peculiar of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders are called 'nice' is maybe just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians are not talking about the fence along with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I can now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau put the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice". our Prime Minister has made Canada pretty sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band has released a music video that took over the Junta which took over power in 2014 and re-establishing the civil government, continuing to reconstruct the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells them what rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was used by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of song was an amazing success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "The Dictator has been blocked in Thailand after a group of activists raised the public to look at this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular as it behaves with the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Let's take a look at these recordings of the video that have followed up some of the political issues that Thailand has followed in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "refers to the drastic section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gives the commander of absolute absolute decision making on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminality, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to detach activists and other critics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, supervised the online content and subjects those who have thrown, the monarchy is persecuted to prosecute the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is putting a striste to "read majesty" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014 the war was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continue to be prosecuted, their decision is expensive U-boats to buy, although security professionals they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video there is even shown how people will be thrown into a black supply, another problem occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they supposedly causes" "" "confusion" "" "in society and they will be benefitted for long detention, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib redet about the rights of LGBTQ + -community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he slim to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine grotenes.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives at the top floor of his family house, which ended them since 1967; in which Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which it had lived as felahyees (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since six years Hdaib is a passionate active, who presents the conservative majority and asks their old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusik.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often deal with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but also calls for the core of the whole Arab world. all these issues do not only find themselves in his hometown of Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that suffers from Damascus in Syria up to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders, and he can suffer according to their own testimony with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it, he attacks against US American foreign policy a special disinclination.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe its sympathy for those who are trying to survive in war areas, anything with his identity as a "Palestinian population of the second generation" - so he referred to himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own living conditions so" "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I'm a man," while in water shook in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. at this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to fasten.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot jitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the rots of warm coffee and the scales of the Kent cigarette in the nose, in the first instance of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometime, Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky above all when looking into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore avoids it easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water to drink - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the interior of Jordan has cancelled a appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic State of the Islamic State of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front of Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and speak the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that had been told the concert "just" because of the sexual orientation of the kangers.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many argue that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that puts the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila, the jordatura people as a "progressive supporters of human rights," which continues to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might be probably not simply silky rhetoric, but is indeed a more evident in the crystallized reality in Jordan that appears in Hdaibs's work clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib built traditional sex-men to be groomed by imposing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of an apparently damped unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years in Jordan the number of 'Ehrenmorde' has increased dramatically - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch therefore achieved its culmination in 2016 by the number of honour morde in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is lacking in order to support women, victims' victims' victims' or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to counter death control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to danger in inner-families "and for their release is often a very long-bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy back from issues that remain in his country as tabular.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib indubitable that his work is political, however, that he has his music, the full of explicit lawyers to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I became aware of politics" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically at the core can be proceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and each other is also." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "that can get what you want," be it belief or non-belief, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on gender equality were strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgramme Roya, in order to notice that his comments from the context began to be distorted, and how his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was just a edited version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not talk to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat should be working later on behalf of the calippers, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes will be silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Still recently, in January 2017, the current news service took several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the grounds, they had expressed critical about the problems in social media dealing with deep-rooting corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that the concert Hdaibs believe that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural changes in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous driving and taking. Jordan has wounded over the second time in a row, but the way of progress - this is what it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, printed and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">I also dreamed Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region through music, art and literature will become a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, spreading infits and artificial nature in hand-led democracies. at least, he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time there is, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warfare are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the neuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">You assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory has been handed over for over a thousand years and out of time, in the armies from the west of Japan in the northeast marching to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to force into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap a couple of great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A communal centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two festivals are straight to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the neuta festival the only true one - and to spend a stunning way of spending his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this story, because they help keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and to encourage a legitimate profession like the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road-smoking and illegal drugs are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region may not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to make up more and more normalities in the experienced hands of hairstyles which can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the utmost boundaries of fantasy and creativity, even has an annual event, inspires the Contests of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts against each other in order to show who can create of the eccentric runners as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the School Augusto Salazar Bondy, who found himself in El Callao, found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hairdressing tools and get training in hairdressing art, allowing them to find jobs.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered dozens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school provided special training workshops in front of the school year in March and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerillaculture</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Lovbotheres" "" "which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The paper is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write just love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who have turned out to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Just this question went to the two young Colombian activists from the Foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Foundation, and inspired it to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write in letters, guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was in the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the Guerillabewedge FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signatures of the peace treaty as so important that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, it is still a long way from the ColombianWoman, until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warricks, who lived in illegal warfare that were exposed to many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out around the clock to enter their weapons as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian company again, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep-hatred opposite Guerillakäffers, it must take up into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Kolumbians must join and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love bothered to former times of guerrilla to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla absorbers which are to be passed personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for letters to reconciliation arose in the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian was able to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people who we love, am Valentine's thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He said, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed most pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian company is willing to make the discourse of a war history towards a common story of peace, say they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Kolumbiens as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the university of Javeriana at Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation in the camp to bring the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC put themselves on how they had done earlier to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders but letters full of subsistence of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that in between lies," told the policy-knowledge of Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a staff of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guerilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, where the guerrilla absorber) saw, I saw a Guerillaker, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had fear, comforting, because besides him on the bed was a MGL-pomegades, a deadly weapon in the "" "" Dornroschenschlaf "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said it nevertheless and asked," "" "hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, therefore I reply to it. "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I awed him completely and set me beside the pomegades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired too, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. the FARC, was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger. "I never thought that anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now, I know that there is a society outside there that are open to us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace is reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work with dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude came students and some leaders of the FARC to a panel round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students grew up in as war as war and the FARC participated in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "many years ago we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state to develop into a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this order is worth overcome all the obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never heard heard before and no voting right, and to realize that the people I have seen often seen as a monster and even hate, even people with beautiful feelings were shot down through their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is living, hurting me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage to us can teach us something and can give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombianco was made that after the drainage would rule peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to take up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call on all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties ahead.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got it all together and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two sample wounds in my right pulmonary.</seg>

<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got a threat.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>

<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it by talking without through the streets; others wanted me in official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say in TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother on the road.</seg>

<seg id="2297">OC Media: how have you fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to give them a name, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still cannot understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I had arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without sign, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checkout into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I tasted the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp I got a message: "you believed in security, just because you left the country?</seg>

<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But above the sex-equation we do not speak, however, that is a tabular theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kautopical elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish to do it, these seelic barrier can I not overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with a camera, I actually put a lot of effort to look like the person that she recalls from her past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are dranked?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the necessary information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who took one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all could hardly wait until the end of Ramadan, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called 'honor "experienced by blood genugung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also stuck in these secret results even now.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it would not be very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are stored there so that they can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be brought in, one will show their bodies on television and claim it, they would have attacked something in your village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply forced, but specifically substitched to be radicalised.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it now only a reference, or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just imagine someone who was one and a half months in the gun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people were gone to this prison after having grown up a beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new of them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself involved as these people were withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, it was not presented as a bandits, and there were no reports previously. we suggest that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise it would not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know, whether these persecutions and exts of people who belong to a so called "non-traditional" orientation to already be in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I have always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think it was already very big already in 2003 when I was still living there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to lead us to the" "" "civil society" "" "but ultimately has thrown back to the Stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this under the sharia law possible?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were satisfied; I had colored eyelashes, carried mtubejeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Scharia has never curved me only a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people met.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that said, "Spotto is not beyond the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when things are funny to the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes to you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never before and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace hold on?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow replaced the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on TV about morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but rather on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel like the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had been smiled and laughed, viewed you on one time with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic has ever worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I didn't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Otherwise I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, together, I begleite them to the hospital and help them get Essenskarten.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as interfactional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put good scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminists and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays are still less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they must do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various fields of life to a glittering ceiling, and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of that and I am suffering double and triple as well.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, on black transious women, on black transists women, on black women in the LGBTI community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I am talking about what kind of matter physically, seelastic and verbal abused, both inside and outside the feminist movement, let many white feminists and white intersectional feminists are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, however, they all agree that women - all women - to come together to uplift their votes and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing "to reach the equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk that there is in addition to sexualised violence a institutionalised form of racial violence, which we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and origin of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls will be transferred with a migration background out of the school as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence suffer from a partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want to do all the women, all men and all individuals nor any skin colour of equal rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is upset to consider injustices in their mind that relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and I'm not going to fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, who always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner wounded 1851 in her speech: "I'm not a woman?" and I also weightless myself to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalized being in a historical sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I sounded me, join me groupings which are also absorbed through cultural anexpropriation to our customs and customs in order to drive their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer attempt to try white women the importance of bracing skin colour and sex. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different arrivals a home and limit themselves from the white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself full of feminism and enter the movement of Womanism that used for my dark skin and my status as women's life, instead of stating myself for a white feminist paradigm which is so persistent that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2492">In 2015 the district of 9600 ads left over because of domestic violence. at 70% of this it went to violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the adverts in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements because of domestic violence at the peace jurisdictions. even here, 86% of the display of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads were 40% of women that they were physically deposited, 55% of women spoke of mental missions.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show however not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen women ministers Ana Baiardi are actually shown only a few of these offences. "to every woman, which will be reimbursed in Paraguay because of mental missions, 9 females do not do so.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she told him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want this, but then after. this should she repented them.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos. but two years ago she bore the psychic violence itself - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the hardest recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never imagined that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">If I have read earlier this, I always thought that only women are occurring because they are deceived of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the missions through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions to Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorally whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to agree that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they dropped so long by Carlos and not left him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain innocence to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that was not from Paraguay, was fought nearly eight years with authorities in Paraguay, in order to prove that its former partner has failed.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") which consists of women who are all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria case everything started with psychic missions.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner did not manage to convince them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities were without a result and even from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against their former partners who developed into an unenviable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen lizauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for women in Paraguay, also provides major problems with the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 in paraguayischen Parliament, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Fürs).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement of the NiUnaMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter, which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law appears to explain feminizide to a permanent impasse and to punish, as in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was altered in some points, in order to also win the members of the law that feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be paved, currently in Paraguay and punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged, much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs, who are currently wearing the victims of violence by themselves, if they only provide display and would like to get a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay it is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a circumstance must take place, so that violence is no longer considered slightly Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever occurs in the face of this facts, does not guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund so long ad until missions are no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016 the law was adopted in the paraguayischen Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, but, among other things, a passage of time has been painted, that the partners in cases of domestic violence have risen to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are going apart.</seg>

<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison, where he was sentenced to one year old prison.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put before judgment, however, came again free.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after he had his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a State set.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he died, besides his role as the sole Sultan, the main offices in the country: prime minister, Defence Minister, Minister of Defence, Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Supreme Council for planning and president of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of sultans is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, in particular of domestic secrecy, public freedom, including freedom of freedom, and human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, too shy and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hinder citizens, also activists, to express their views on public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure, and the detention of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial began in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court condemned the three journalists to prison guards and ordained the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were condemned both of a disorder in the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "excavation of the State of State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was found guilty about the violation of an audience of audience and guilty for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three-year penalties and banknotes at the height of 3000 of each 3000 (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year profession was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was condemned to a year prison and fine fine in the amount of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after using "a disseminator to spread material that could represent a threat to public order" for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit was arrested in the amount of 5000 omanic rial (13 000 US dollars) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to judgement from the imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Court of Appeal Al-Abri said in a hearing on 26 December 2016, Al-Haj condemned to a year and Al-Maamari to six months of prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 and was dismissed on 10 April 2017. al-Haj is still in prison, where he was flawed his one-year sentence.</seg>

<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the information ministers personally signed another statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and thus the minister introduced itself against the decision of the Court of Appeal to present the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuous closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only ones in which in Oman in recent times the press freedom has been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">For more injury, for example, include the closing of the website of the independent journal Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing termination of Azamn and the detention of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf-Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media. it is a growing section that addressed the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need for the need for medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that have special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have considerable effects in the poorest countries in Africa as elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research which is carried out by African scientists themselves, in building own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>

<seg id="2593">He grew in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic first pointed out the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself relied on HIV virus as he decided to go back home to support the sambler health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and the confusion of the media through these research.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: right now lies the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambental national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory testing.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I had just a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only set up solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being Macher instead of yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often unusable in our environment and sometimes it's even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research that you had not had previously?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratories is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the public opinion of science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of the space, health care (non-transferable diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa facing western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the complicated access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred since the 1980s in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in the space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In almost 20 years, Morton's work became only through his own ingenuity and the question how many Salatters can get there.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he remarked that more salads were patented and that he was not able to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resiliency against diseases, a special red or green, or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been registered in more plants such as cereals or cardboard sites. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned for food security around the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia, Morton has become more and more salads, but it is now longer necessary since his work is getting more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like to lie in a river a rock, in order to cut down the paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "" "" "so we have to do that, but it is a break with the farmed tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far towards Salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they set before judgment, nobody can breed any more a new salatsorte because all features already patented. "he does so well and tried to cut out those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and makes every effort to use any material which is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and over the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being to make sure that some plants and causes are not protected as intellectuals and are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can agree that others can use them freely and freely use them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"" "" "" "however, this does not mean that they do not continue to business with their seeds and buy it." "" "Open Source" "" "do not allow anyone to buy seeds, to breeding it, and not immediately sow it - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patente." ""</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi, manager Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in larger associations, such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance capacity.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "Open-Source" movement is not busy with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the increasingly popular mergers in the global agricultural industry, as for example, in August or September 2016." who is good, locally and sustainable produced vegetables, should also know that the way in which vegetables is bred, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritionism without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will continue to provide assistance with other seeds, as opposed to them, to patent seeds and plant-characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies are compromised, since the available gene-pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which thus was always restricted to unbounded.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive manager of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with genetischer variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about a third of all cardboard is protected as a intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there is such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-built plants such as pastries are patented in a bigger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of reflections</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they have targeted reasonable characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such because of which they steer in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available pesticides for breeders are decreasing by more and more patents. genetic diversity is now necessary, but ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse prepredictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four genitals and cooperation with institutions such as the Agriculture of the United States, the company dedicated itself to the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "" "" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property is related to other breeders because" "" "patents and protection of pesticides innovations promote" "". "a patent is basically a plan to which everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to reach the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but supports them by being made available to the public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years waiting to wait until a patent expires, and certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you wait for such a long time to breed, to breed plants, which are adapted to the modified environment conditions, would have been lost the battle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to stay: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers ease their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we can't keep using the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">As a whole, Morton seems to be patented on the concept, plant-characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeder we have finally no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant-in in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi government member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who bred a sluggish, also bred its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Whoever believes in industrial agriculture involving large courtyards and monocultures, for the cultivation of herbzide cultivation, bred in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly a piece of GM." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some moderate-sized companies (such that are moving on international markets but smaller than B. Monsanto are) patents, manage to survive most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either strictly refuse it or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for in his breeding-garden Salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the prevention of plant patches would be innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need a constantly new material for my catalogue since I know that my competitors are selling my sorts in a couple of years, "says he." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, so that in my opinion one simply makes it pretty easy. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leading in the "open source" breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an "open source" seed program works the center with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend at the 05.August, the Egyptian government sent the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documented human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities approved for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information abid- despite this attack and the swaying of Egypt's right and constitution by the authorities, which the law should not defend their objective to uncover up freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blockage and not to follow. we insist that our task is to fulfill.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first-being website of an human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities referred to more than two months 21 websites, such as blink the independent news page MADA masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and the from Qatar-shameful network of Al Jazeera because of "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the Columnisten and human rights research scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada does not have access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spreading of columnists and articles that he does not write in Egypt's websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now, the blog, which he set up in order to bypass the censities of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider where also a newspaper blog is native, however, it is available on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he reported on Egyptian security guards in December 2013, while he reported on the Studentenprotests and a video took place, such as the police of bodily violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly turn to politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook Commentary, Ziada devoted to the blockage through the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It succeeded to convey to me the feeling of a siege condition; a detention, a vertically murder, unloading of the national Security Council, the blockage blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I wrote not in vain. in other words: my words have an influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to deal with censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now however, after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in whole Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old school," said every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro, "" thieves smoke with military weapons, "President Tempio sent 8500 soldiers of the Army, Navy and Lucasafee to Rio."</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local paper.</seg>

<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, rob, sex break, etc. all that happens to the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, will be published in the heading "War in Rio" (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes off the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, declared Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper throughout the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 countries that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the article article the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war discourse, if he is distorted, can also be used to hide from the police, which only shoots and then ask questions to cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">"" "" "" "but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners." ""</seg>
<seg id="2770">Schadet the name "War" more than they are useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the message portal The Intercept Brasil was arguing the journalist as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility with the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - as we have shown extra in the analysis of military installations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficneglect to neglect public service.</seg>
