this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in the New York Times .
long before each someone had listened to Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular , that N@@ SA illegal phones heard by Americans .
it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
therein he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence office in which the CIA was literally j@@ umped into an atomic bom@@ b for an atomic bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter does not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
almost 10 years ago the government against the R@@ isen is determined and asked him to name his in@@ born sources .
in this move he became a symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to judge and journalists .
according to the first constitutional order the media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ ff , which they do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , when the government at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous re@@ porter did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
so from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen he lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , only days before the process , something unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they were lon@@ ged for years that it would be crucial for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters and sources can always hide fewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead of fail@@ ing to fail and to bring rise to the statements , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the investig@@ ators shall be kept secret without his consent , his phone @-@ wise .
just as its email data , financial and bank information , its credit card , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
among the information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ acked source , to judge .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead , the judiciary has more condem@@ ns than all the U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how it can be a problem , especially because the government rated too much from their work as a secret .
since the 11th September , nearly every article on national security was the outcome of that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to send out all .
but just as technology the government allows to circum@@ v@@ ise the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can take that from the moment in which they contact , instead of desc@@ ending , in the witness .
today there are communication software , which it has not yet existed , when R@@ isen his book had written , and it is essentially more secure as normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source code system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet famous , called Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work , further developed .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as in any ordinary contact form .
these are then encryp@@ ted and stored on a server in which only the respective news agency will have access .
so the government may not proc@@ ure more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would require would not be available at the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that are je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed to us all .
it is in us to make sure that not only technology denomin@@ ator as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
who knows about dis@@ states in the care of soldiers and report about crowded hospital hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for contamin@@ ated water from Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , which war@@ n us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 &#93; the largest data le@@ ck of history released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that fri@@ ction and mice &#93; have hidden from Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we were sent from messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents available in Panama &apos;s resident Tour@@ pack fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ er Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ ously company . can you set up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works , how it works .
this has already resulted in the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is step@@ ped back .
also , there are reports that a composite of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ companies in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of child@@ days , one famous C@@ elli@@ sts .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous at the next release , and the next reveals documents .
now that sounds like the pi@@ lot of a agent be@@ holding or an John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am .
it seems we@@ pt away from you , ordinary people .
why should we handle this ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful able are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all their taxes to pay , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , like secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few people to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveil@@ ed for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I imagine it always like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ger .
so one has a company in another company , in another company that makes it nearly impossible to truly understand who is behind this prayer .
it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the USA .
probably because there has been no prominent Americans in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but through the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ er Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
would we have a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. countries to provide less information to create a firm as a libr@@ arian ment .
this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence in the US has allowed employees of school@@ ing , school children .
it has allowed che@@ at to t@@ weak particularly sus@@ pen@@ se investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent an un@@ covered inquiries to the offices of 13 forests in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as African minist@@ ries , who wanted to bring out money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it that all to an attorney made by our investig@@ ator suggestions on how to transfer his money .
these were all prec@@ urs@@ ors . none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course there was never passed to anyone doing money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has broad@@ cast@@ ed suggestions to our cover@@ t proposals .
it is not about a single top @-@ pol@@ itic , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability are established .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very tr@@ en@@ sive as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as well @-@ born optim@@ ism , I really see that a lot has started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen the violations of more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is based in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have launched a law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ quar@@ tered companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ex@@ ecutives in the economy that arise and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campa@@ ign@@ ing to stop by laws this kind of in@@ transpar@@ ence .
together we can end in@@ transpar@@ ence that now allow this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I am almost kid@@ n@@ apped and in the luggage of a red ma@@ zet that would be praised .
one day after I had completed my design degree , I made a rear selling .
a type in the red Mazda remained standing and looked like my stuff .
he purchased one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where would you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk &apos;s room to land !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a air @-@ mat@@ ress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; De@@ h , &quot; please ? &quot;
at night I was in bed , I stum@@ bled on the ceiling and thought : &quot; O man ! what have I built in me ?
a Wild@@ stran@@ der sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I was such a fear that I went out of the bed , on the to@@ es of a door , and my sleeping door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he had purchased from me is now in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers , actually friends , who only wa@@ ited to become discovered ?
people on my air @-@ rats has been normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air @-@ care .
let &apos;s take a lead , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ate runs and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have translated how to make a bit of it . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and each morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded such a &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed &amp; Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on wood@@ land .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham r@@ mel@@ et squ@@ ander completely different because we made them for our guests .
we stayed with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell , fro@@ sted Brian and thank you .
we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into the roll@@ ers .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether we could make a business concept .
as we present ourselves to the Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website , on which people publicly post their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the sort of room whose doors can be closed when a visit is over .
over the Internet they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the rocket was ign@@ ited .
but they are not .
nobody who is still at Tro@@ st , would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one gets on the things that you can do . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to des@@ ig@@ ate objects but now we wanted to create immense trust by Design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design trust ?
I would like to give you an exact sample , which degree of confidence we stri@@ ved .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comp@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock you out your mobile phone .
type your un@@ lock on your left side .
this quietly excursion of panic , which you feel right now -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locking mobile phone of a fore@@ igner in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only time so , who now has Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you please say on Twitter that he kan@@ des for the Office of the President ?
you can return the manual now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail on this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor would have appeared once with his name : if he tells , how did he come , how his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 be@@ ass@@ essm@@ ents that all say : &quot; he can really very well un@@ lock hand@@ ing hand ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ elaborate feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to post negative evalu@@ ations .
in the end we decided to wait for both hosts and guests booked their jud@@ g@@ ments before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have performed with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence .
little surprisingly , we trust the men the most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we trust .
this is a natural social pres@@ um@@ ing .
thr@@ illing becomes it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by jud@@ g@@ ments .
if you have less than three evalu@@ ations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation for vel@@ oc@@ ities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
furthermore , we ro@@ de that trust is dependent on how much one is cheaper .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little about the example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tells a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is also not accepted .
there is therefore an optimum level of openness , for example &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ works in your apartment ! I am doing with my family vacation . &quot;
how can we create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we will use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which issues one should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dismant@@ le these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people will take our offer .
you can see three things .
firstly : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third , a need that was previously not covered before .
for us , business is just very good .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have allowed parties to celebrate parties or appart@@ ments .
hosts have guests sitting in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts , if I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further .
fortunately , from the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction ever had a problem .
for people trust each other right .
when trust works , it can create Wonder@@ ful .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him into the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to be cardi@@ ac due to se@@ ated activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are a real protective gel that can save one &apos;s life even though they don &apos;t know yet properly .
they drive to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled about this concept I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about an economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share economy describes a trade , which promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
what if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place that you visited , a group would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a bar in a pub that one has never heard before .
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from reason to come together ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared common ?
I imagine towns that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ pl@@ ot@@ ation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking that the government belonged ,
now ro@@ omm@@ ates were offered . students who were looking for a lead ,
were passed to people whose children were with@@ drawn . there were inc@@ ub@@ ator programs started .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , night is 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries as a guest in a fore@@ igner or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was given to us .
we did not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality there was also previously .
there were already similar websites .
so why did our work just ?
aside from luck and timing , we know that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Mazda is passing by me .
we naturally know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can be able to use Design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a cred@@ itor ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , subjected to a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , a terrorist attack ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the media is a thing that look like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think , most would not know any Muslims .
pres@@ um@@ ably people do not speak with their deriv@@ atives .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it is great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a pract@@ itioner , spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I chose this .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lu@@ stige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely against the pressure , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Kor@@ an .
I read it , thought after , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed in .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm puts me sometimes for cr@@ ying .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like .
later , I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in essence the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , that aw@@ ful morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had at the end of my breakfast , looked upon the screen and saw the word &apos; E@@ il@@ iser . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed rapidly into revol@@ t .
why should we do something like this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mek@@ ka ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u related me the actions of others of a civil war into a susp@@ ects .
by the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the integration program .
I remember , as we drove me -- as deep it went down in my seat , and I feared the first time that it was recognized as Muslim .
we went to this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , looked and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , the said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be cau@@ ti@@ ous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ w in well illumin@@ ated areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gath@@ er@@ ings you not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then there was Friday one week -- the day that Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not about this first Friday , the mosque could be a reward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw this extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or other people who held for Muslims , sm@@ ashed and struck .
there were really bran@@ dan@@ u@@ ations on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because people who attacked this country had attacked our land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have defeated the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also fu@@ ri@@ ous .
it is not easy to tell yourself constantly .
I have nothing to ask questions I love questions .
there are alleg@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they are talking about my community like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
there is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ our can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be seen under review .
the alternatives are useless since the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sth@@ el@@ ers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ques .
will be the closure of mos@@ ques in America safer ?
there will be perhaps a few parking , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith toler@@ ant , and to show greater participation .
and as me , as director of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people will actually not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you will be radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the radic@@ alisation process one has found that he begins to start online . as a first , the person can make a brain @-@ la@@ under@@ ing , that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who suff@@ ice their behaviour and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or diver@@ ging by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must adhere to people to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , if we recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ club cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology by their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if one casts a look at it , it doesn &apos;t drives what they las@@ hed in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ ture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that she can read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leaders .
he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought her to silence and told her that her anger , their sense of the in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring into difficulties .
nothing inspired by anything and something that would have given their anger sense , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke one solution .
this I@@ mam set the connection to God and her church again .
instead of having taken her anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what they learned in the mosque , they kept before it to join the IS .
it was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , happen at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces .
a study reveals : when man reports on test messages , in which negative about Muslims reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ cis@@ ion of rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you &apos;re looking at when the mood against Muslims from above - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war , and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for mani@@ pulation of the public in order to explo@@ it the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling with Muslims is an early signal .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear sm@@ ates us all .
in the assignment of collective bar@@ ence , it is not just about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , gener@@ ous man he knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his life . she was stun@@ ned and said ,
&quot; when has been such a sealed young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , she was mur@@ dered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after making statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook site .
he took eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be only am@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we bes@@ ought it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the nur@@ sery , we drove silent , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thanks and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered Christians were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , A@@ thei@@ sts , Bel@@ ie@@ ver and non @-@ cred@@ itation who had come to join us , but to join us .
at this moment I fell un@@ broken .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be sure ?
or you will join those who mean , we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so Dal@@ ia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you would say those who might be claim@@ ing that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a shepherd with dr@@ au@@ ght , so an exception rather than not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ ei@@ ving you not . I am totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one can look at the Muslims around the world , and I did so with the study involved in Muslim men all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I do not have an exception .
if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . Dal@@ ia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is shortly before to become a milli@@ on@@ den@@ business .
control , environmental surveillance , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ re@@ perc@@ ussions in our socially conscious consciousness has built a autonomous fleet of flying machines in France live in France a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bri@@ cks . some years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
by tigh@@ tening plane , high speed and acceler@@ ation in the stem room .
you can also build self @-@ continu@@ able structures .
have learned to wear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the utmost in the autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonomous , it will need to know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on fast development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each air@@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest bottom . B. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficiently efficiently , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has a great advantage when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one side @-@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by exercising .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often use basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of mov@@ eable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
two trained , trained , controlled air@@ driven devices , who had only two movable pieces : a prop@@ eller and a h@@ eck@@ ru@@ der .
recently discovered , we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est aircraft . it was inv@@ ented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ aster , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ators or chec@@ ker @-@ surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inner life very much , so that it can fly to safe and move in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the h@@ eck@@ or . to bring it to flying , I have to just throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of seeing it right properly if all watch me is small , so I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in in@@ geni@@ ous , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance .
what do you do with all this abundance ?
you see that he is not yet symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the great capability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is fil@@ med or even how it rot@@ ated .
naturally it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is pro@@ fic@@ i@@ able in models that the rest is learned directly with flying .
let &apos;s see that again .
when flying machines should be part of our day @-@ day , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller air@@ machines .
this turns in clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance square @-@ Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , it goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , even though limited .
we will then demonstrate that by doing a half flight .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic reserves .
the large number of autonomous units , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units makes possible a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and permit it with local technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no ceiling .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine at the end of Broadway wants to become a flying l@@ amp@@ er system at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the impact of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as memory , how wonderful and con@@ du@@ cts our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ ie , two black holes are getting faster , they turned so the mass thre@@ w Son@@ nen in a t@@ enth@@ s in pure energy .
this short moment they sh@@ ep@@ ed it brigh@@ ter than all Stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but your energy put them out in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed down into space @-@ time fabric and the universe explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events initially tim@@ eless .
1.3 billion years ago was created just a majority of life on earth .
since then , the earth has brought a lot of things : coral , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , people and -- God is standing by -- even the internet .
approximately 25 years ago , a group decided to build a group of particularly b@@ old -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - to build a huge laser det@@ ector to seek gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , that are approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they stopped for crazy .
but enough people recognized them as mad geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation was funded with their idea .
after decades of decades , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ric gra@@ vit@@ ational ob@@ servatory .
during the time the precision of LI@@ GO could be substantially increased , what the recognition of recognition could greatly improved .
therefore , you call it Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 LI@@ GO was started for a last test run to clear some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes caused by the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ ghes : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ are@@ well of my to@@ g@@ ill &apos;s father .
basically , it was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ ghes , theoretical physi@@ cist at the MIT . he has been examined for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves out of black holes and their through ob@@ servat@@ ories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cor@@ nerst@@ one in the fabric of space and time .
at the same time , the wave will spread the space and its entire content into a direction and put into the other .
to illustrate , instruc@@ tors in courses on the Rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often pose a really self @-@ adhesive dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was pressed by us during the meeting of the waves and stressed . the Stret@@ ch of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , then this length would be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us exactly . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are vast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are final and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds her , LI@@ GO is more than an eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : face extracts , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite handy . for this way you can make a picture or a map of things going to perceive the light around you .
at killing , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean a lot :
the face of your child is about .
instead we lau@@ gh at certain properties such as tape and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now is just Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob supp@@ breaks them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot produce any simple images of objects in the universe with them .
but by doing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least there are the most common frequencies in audi@@ ble area for LI@@ GO .
so when we convert a wave in switching , we can hear the universe literally .
the gra@@ v@@ itation to lau@@ gh , can tell us about a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , my colleague Scott has already very long busy .
SH : two black , not twi@@ sting holes , cir@@ cl@@ ing simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional tone change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of stick of movement , shaped into the wav@@ el@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that has at least I never forget -- heard LI@@ GO : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; Jem@@ and who knows what to listen to he recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sunlight , which is about as fast as the ro@@ ds of your mix@@ er .
AA : think of what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second , before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
there is the remaining meaning of LI@@ GO .
LI@@ GO has an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to all the lou@@ der and the invisible .
much in space we are able to do -- practical or fundamentally -- not visible .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why masks stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about space .
the exciting physical processes are happening at the core , which lies behind thousand kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on hidden .
we will never go through , as this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the judgment is cover@@ all through its own lights .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact I found LI@@ GO out at the first stop things that we did not expect .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , black holes produced , such as LI@@ GO they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so @-@ called for our ar@@ che@@ ological work .
LI@@ GO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in space , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories - a whole new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I rehear@@ sed an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do before I feared , fre@@ ed , puri@@ fying my fear .
my fear to keep speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life deeply , which was unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kittens . &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
she asked me once I could play with her than I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to my family . from there I got to play always with them as soon as you call me up . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I am always saying Yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I feel very ef@@ fort@@ lessly .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a stun@@ ting side @-@ effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; yes &quot; session to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream job .
I am rocket . I think things you catch up to life .
dream@@ job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I creative TV . I re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ere television .
I make television , in a great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for placing the 70 hours program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel may lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars of television , four hours of television , three episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours on TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday nights .
throughout the world , my series production in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ pure . I have to find time , really st@@ ile , creative time to gather my fans of war@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , which are around the world .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author . &quot;
I tell you so all of you who work so hard , whether I speak of a company , a country or a classroom , when I speak of work , so you understand that I am not just around the computer , and fant@@ asi@@ ere , and it is true when I say , I understand that it &apos;s not a dream of a dream vacation .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything swe@@ at -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country of nowhere .
it &apos;s when I put troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
so as a sn@@ ap a high tone , I supplied a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ onc@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and oral , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on her .
many people take on when I &apos;m giving them the sums , that I &apos;m talking about writing , that writing my pleasure .
do not understand me wrong , this does it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with TV production , when I began to work and work , build , to create , and co @-@ collabor@@ ating , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the sums is more than writing .
the sums of action is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the tot@@ als is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sums of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you cannot seek any other than the size .
the feeling that cannot be different from the size , no matter what price .
this is called the Sum@@ y .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is genius .
perhaps it means the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the Sum@@ y .
I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I will not ask it in question .
to make sure : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more watch me , the more I write history , all the more expectations there .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I am car@@ afe , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this Sum@@ y . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the sums up .
revised , over@@ sized , exagger@@ ated , hidden .
the sums spent .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mom is a single worker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Bec@@ ause , I want to go to Sh@@ onda land . &quot;
they are the children of a tit@@ ani .
you are a baby title .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums stopped .
the sums of the motor is hidden .
I didn &apos;t loved my job anymore . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz came not returned .
my tot@@ als was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , held weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ate , a tit@@ ude not deleg@@ ate , is not on , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
however , there was no sums .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sums was me .
so what to do if that is what you do , the work you love , suddenly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ w you out of , bl@@ us@@ her author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do what you do is doing a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the sums you feel when the sums stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress brought me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things are aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; kittens . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; kittens . &quot;
when is that happening ?
I get rid of it when I am Titan and called for my sums , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is not special .
we play and their sisters come across , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; ever@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of money , I can do nothing except that .
I am focused .
I am le@@ ise .
the land , which I am sag@@ ging , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are stick@@ y fingers and hum@@ id nuts , delicate voices , wax and song in which it appears to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The king@@ d@@ gling is los@@ ed .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is capable of .
a mental door goes on and an energy push comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the tot@@ ality comes slowly back .
no full volume , barely there , it is quietly , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the work environment , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ ing , which is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m descri@@ bing the broad@@ casts and television @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real tot@@ ality depends on the love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that is from the lust of life .
the real tot@@ als is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums ignored the pressure of history , the tasks to enligh@@ tening tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I escap@@ ed God the false words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child will play with me , I will say yes .
I do this generally , so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice but I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not to be du@@ sting me like working .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to be home at work as well .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person is working rather than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sincer@@ ely , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we r@@ umin@@ ate in the garden , before and back , round and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ ote Sei@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en .
and I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent , and confused .
I always run after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how you live , and the sums of the universe met me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I play and play , till I ask myself : why have we ever stopped using the games ?
you can also say it ! say they always say yes if your child would like to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
there you are probably right , but you can do it also !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my children want to play at most 15 minutes with me up to them , to make them something different .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes it replaced me a Marien@@ k@@ äfer or K@@ eks .
and now my teenage daughter for 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
each can get 15 minutes each , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ actions .
the day is short : dinner , the children finished .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my welfare , my world . it does not have to be the children . it &apos;s not the children to feel a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
I am not perfect at it . I failed and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan Poker training when I wanted to meet even more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not get full 15 minutes each ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ m@@ ons came back in my spare time . the sums appear to return when I am not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door open , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear my un@@ familiar ody , it fills me and my soul . she leads me to new ideas . I took it to the full and love my work again .
I like the sums , but I love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
so@@ ap las@@ en and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my Sum@@ y .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
the sums of the work is part of me but just a part . and I am so thankful for that .
it is s@@ cri@@ b to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a tit@@ anium , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and for more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better work I am working .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums , the marathon that I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the tot@@ als , the Sum@@ y , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this Sum@@ y , the more turns this unusual , asp@@ iring , naked and new joie @-@ feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am rocket . I think things from , I aw@@ akes you to live .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream@@ job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &apos; yes &apos; to less work and for more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after serious stroke , or after an automobile accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon is it very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability .
that is probably the reason why I was working for Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional Neuro@@ ch@@ ir@@ urg ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
surely they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ ting stimulation . &quot; thereby , one can influence a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence the cir@@ cuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson which suffered under severe cit@@ ations and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with something help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior consultant and worked on day and night in the emergency .
often I accom@@ od@@ ate patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ o trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain stim@@ ulated and the skull @-@ pressure increases .
in order to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull @-@ pressure .
to do this , one sometimes has to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze us with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells of a tissue balance is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts we managed Jean @-@ François .
that was what he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you still know from the fil@@ ologi@@ e@@ unterricht that stem cells un@@ mature cells are , which can transform itself into any cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery .
we made a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells for@@ s@@ ly changed .
they slowly spread themselves and after a couple of weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
these cells are derived from these cells .
these blue and red cells represent Double@@ cort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you are making 4 % of our large hir@@ und@@ rin@@ ding cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why stay they kept us ?
we do not know that .
we believe it will take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injury .
but that is not that safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of bra@@ vest from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic field and then the cells are as cultiv@@ ating as Jean @-@ François did .
and then it is colored mort@@ al to track them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ ple@@ ated it to the du@@ ne@@ al of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reduce these cells in normal brain tissue , and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ pose the same cells in mat@@ ing brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ ff we were able to work with monkey .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we moved an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells have preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells , which were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we paint in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain death ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual work@@ station .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets of a tray .
they made them very good .
when they reached a stur@@ dy skill level , we completed in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex the Hand@@ mot@@ ions area .
then , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed ; they could no longer move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , she recovered spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ ism . they are reco@@ vering to some degree , just as at the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we ple@@ aded his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkey that reco@@ vering spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as accurate and not so fast .
now you see the cells re@@ im@@ ple@@ ated : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream still is to im@@ pose them on the human being .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need that . &quot;
I am in any case .
of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams of papers and forms to run these types of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
JB : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : have a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
JB : it is difficult to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate the treatments it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study .
one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . JB : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thanks for your visit at TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake , it as a course of granted .
we see democracy not as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as invent@@ aris of our society .
we tend to look at them as un@@ change@@ able poetry .
we believe capitalism is inev@@ it@@ ably led to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy is w@@ aning with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my infl@@ ated friends who would tell me that democracy would change if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you to believe in cooperation with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an error , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are in common , our future lies dark and our great , new technologies will be wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the topic of waste , I want to point out to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat our economies .
I call it the &quot; tw@@ ins &quot; parad@@ ox &quot; parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain @-@ mountain ,
yet , few recognize his tw@@ ins .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is however too anxi@@ ous to invest it there , where it would be productive and in@@ comes , with which one could put the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tr@@ illion invested US dollars , invested in all the weal@@ thin@@ ess goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tr@@ illion dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion dollars , which at the same time compar@@ es in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and property prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the tw@@ ins summit , which are not equi@@ voc@@ al by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low ven@@ ous economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who is out of fear that the prophecy of the O@@ rak@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ awak@@ ened the circumstances bring about that Ö@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ dern with capitalism --
his extremely mer@@ bi@@ al Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , improve human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue , What do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the outside and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed many of them --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to min@@ ate the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these closures .
the decision in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they entered the working arms , and not only has the right to freedom of speech , but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political co@@ determination with the same voting for questions of the prosec@@ ution .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been held for a long time --
like a cand@@ le , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies have not been their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy had only emerged as a complete separation of politics and business , and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics , while the economy has become the world of corporations -- a democracy in democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present democr@@ acies , there is time in which this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two rather than the economy is beginning to mig@@ rate the policy and de@@ duc@@ ted them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not located on a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because one can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics is inter@@ viewed in the economy and separated the areas .
I mentioned my ha@@ dern with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about just like a flock of rob@@ ber@@ y who , so sustain@@ ably the animals from which they nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ vation at the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy , which has become so far can@@ ni@@ fied by the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ generated , inequality increases , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too anxi@@ ously to invest the cash out of their companies .
the more successful capitalism sells the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; the higher the twin @-@ summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that the politics and the economy must come together again , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , so as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea nearly 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t work well .
the teaching from the de@@ acon of the Soviet Union should be that the toil@@ ers are getting to reg@@ ain only a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to create the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of tw@@ ins will be higher , the waste of har@@ ness and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby guarant@@ e@@ eing the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a hospital surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought to survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a D@@ yst@@ opy , or is similar to the human being in the &quot; Star Trek &quot; or through something that are used to human beings into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
what about what could it look like to have this &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ topia than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar yst@@ roph@@ y ?
in practical implementation I would like to provide you with some examples soon .
in the field of companies : ask for a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a work@@ station to next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one has just worked -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income deri@@ ves from capital and income , and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong , but do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and expenses , and ultimately no up@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ins .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce yourselves that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; in the interest of the entire humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is acted -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in mind that this fund has invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes was proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time we were not able to implement the technical means .
today , we have in particular the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world which I describe to you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they privileged people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ note , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ an .
but above all else there is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar di@@ oc@@ opy ?
the answer depends on how we decide to work together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as a liber@@ t@@ ary Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just told is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not do that , the technological development will generate a massive decline in general economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers are referred to as &quot; long term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant ,
also like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a Liber@@ t@@ ist Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally enter@@ t@@ ained .
BG : actually , and now we are also at ease .
Y@@ V : if you do not , you do not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think about the vision of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited the democracy on politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the field of business -- is a completely democracy zone .
in some ways , if I must say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles China today to the England of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism to democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical as concerns the democratic development .
what one can observe now in China is very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now suggest that to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells by hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ ener am curious to your experience as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely from compl@@ ac@@ ency to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant denial made a massive destruction line through the euro zone , and continues to go massive that threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to be chosen the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries a economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be hes@@ it@@ ant for a while , but if change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister named after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he claims he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
naturally I made mistake .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed it had an honest interest in the sides of the cred@@ itors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to put our government on the case only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the wrong ones that ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to conf@@ ess that for 5 years they have experienced a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal voltage .
worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none from the Troika of the don@@ ors who raised this policy was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive team of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone from someone who lives and loves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the forces will be released and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not alone for Europe to have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , which it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are going wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks for that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy price , most of them have never heard , although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for much of you .
this is going back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for putting the shows and content to produce Amazon .
of course this is a very hard re@@ batt@@ ling industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy can not select any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located very right on this curve .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the I@@ MD@@ B website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this rating .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows such as Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows , ad@@ dic@@ ted where , after having a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes up more thoughts about the medium output , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor negative , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something , so Roy will not risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he takes a guarantee success , so he keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch any free of charge .
and if Amazon is out of course , you are att@@ acking it right ?
millions of spect@@ ators see these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed when looking at these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you p@@ auses , which parts you ski@@ p , or look again or again .
you collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of that show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it does not seem to remember many of this show because she was not so good .
it is only a average @-@ show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of that curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ ds at 7.5 -- so something on average , but not exactly what was attached to Roy and his team .
about at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analytics . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team has viewed the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows you like etc .
then they use this data to find these small details about the spect@@ ators : which shows you like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series on a broad@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very knowled@@ geable , data sealed .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic were wise , that it should work with everything .
if one colle@@ cts millions of data for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years to statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimized it through very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good television , or ?
when data analysis is not working then this is something frigh@@ tening , because we are living in a time when we draw more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in the US in the U.S. and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of se@@ ated companies are already wrong .
yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes .
2009 Google announce that it is known by data analysis break@@ through@@ s of flu , flu@@ vial art , pre@@ sup@@ poses -- by means of data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success comes in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked f@@ law@@ less , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work out anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these mistakes the data circul@@ ates in decisions of life - in the workplace , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
even I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gen@@ etics -- an area with which some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have realized a few patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and un@@ successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
you have to solve a complex problem , you do mostly do two things :
as a first , you put this problem in its parts , so that you can analyze the items ; as a date put the items back together to summar@@ ise a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and resume .
and now most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suited to res@@ ist the parts again and then come into a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
when there is something there is good in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces come back again , even if the information is incomplete -- particularly when the brain is an expert .
that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also go in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why otherwise they would not have been able to understand , but the decision on how to take all of these parts , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , what meant they were a big personal risk with that decision .
Amazon , on the contrary , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they compet@@ ed by TV ideas then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool and in order not to forget that this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it gave data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or no question , you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will become it later with a Techni@@ k@@ demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , while I should listen to the ball in retro@@ spect .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much more energetic , such as data analysis , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball dance and dark and dark . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data is still paying off to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
