<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize in the New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before each someone had listened to Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular, that NSA illegal phones heard by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he describes a catastrophic US intelligence office in which the CIA was literally jumped into an atomic bomb for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter does not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">Almost 10 years ago the government against the Risen is determined and asked him to name his inborn sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to judge and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional order the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right when media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the muff, which they do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015, Risen he lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they were longed for years that it would be crucial for their case, the demands of the government were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide fewer.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "instead of failing to fail and to bring rise to the statements, they could also do his digital footprints for him." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators shall be kept secret without his consent, his phone-wise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as its email data, financial and bank information, its credit card, and even travel documents with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among the information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and cracked source, to judge.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has more condemns than all the U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how it can be a problem, especially because the government rated too much from their work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since the 11th September, nearly every article on national security was the outcome of that a whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to send out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology the government allows to circumvise the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can take that from the moment in which they contact, instead of descending, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which it has not yet existed, when Risen his book had written, and it is essentially more secure as normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source code system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet famous, called Aaron Swartz, and is today from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work, further developed.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server in which only the respective news agency will have access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government may not procure more information secretly, and many of the information they would require would not be available at the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world develop new spying technologies that are jeopardized to us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is in us to make sure that not only technology denominator as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about disstates in the care of soldiers and report about crowded hospital hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, which warn us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016] the largest data leck of history released.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that friction and mice] have hidden from Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were sent from messages about a Leck of 11 million documents available in Panama's resident Tourpack fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Moser Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymously company. can you set up? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is stepped back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there are reports that a composite of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of childdays, one famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous at the next release, and the next reveals documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the pilot of a agent beholding or an John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wept away from you, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle this?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful able are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes to pay, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world discuss media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens are used by some few people to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveiled for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a Matrjoschkapuger.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company that makes it nearly impossible to truly understand who is behind this prayer.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports of this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there has been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle according to which these tax havens work, Moser Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Would we have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. countries to provide less information to create a firm as a librarian ment.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparence in the US has allowed employees of schooling, school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheat to tweak particularly suspense investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an uncovered inquiries to the offices of 13 forests in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as African ministries, who wanted to bring out money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that all to an attorney made by our investigator suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all precursors. none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course there was never passed to anyone doing money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has broadcasted suggestions to our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top-politic, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very trensive as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as well-born optimism, I really see that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen the violations of more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by the British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is based in central registers at the national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have launched a law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens as a means used to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headquartered companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and campaigning to stop by laws this kind of intransparence.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can end intransparence that now allow this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I am almost kidnapped and in the luggage of a red mazet that would be praised.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design degree, I made a rear selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A type in the red Mazda remained standing and looked like my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He purchased one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where would you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse, "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk's room to land!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a air-matress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Deh," please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stumbled on the ceiling and thought: "O man! what have I built in me?</seg>
<seg id="114">A Wildstrander sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I was such a fear that I went out of the bed, on the toes of a door, and my sleeping door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he had purchased from me is now in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who only waited to become discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air-rats has been normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air-care.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a lead, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate runs and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there were a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have translated how to make a bit of it. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and each morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded such a "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast "[AIRBed & Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on woodland.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham rmelet squander completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We stayed with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door into the castle fell, frosted Brian and thank you.</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the rollers.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">As we present ourselves to the Investors: "we want to create a website, on which people publicly post their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the sort of room whose doors can be closed when a visit is over.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket was ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at Trost, would invest in a business to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one gets on the things that you can do. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to desigate objects but now we wanted to create immense trust by Design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you an exact sample, which degree of confidence we strived.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your compfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock you out your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlock on your left side.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly excursion of panic, which you feel right now -- -- is just what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocking mobile phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who now has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please say on Twitter that he kandes for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the manual now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor would have appeared once with his name: if he tells, how did he come, how his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 beassessments that all say: "he can really very well unlock handing hand!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-elaborate feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to post negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end we decided to wait for both hosts and guests booked their judgments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have performed with Stanford a study. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are with regard to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly, we trust the men the most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presuming.</seg>
<seg id="181">Thrilling becomes it when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by judgments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for velocities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we rode that trust is dependent on how much one is cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little about the example" "" "Hi!" "", "you do not get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells a lot, as for example: "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">There is therefore an optimum level of openness, for example "Tolle Artworks in your apartment! I am doing with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We will use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which issues one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help us overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people will take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">Firstly: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was previously not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have allowed parties to celebrate parties or appartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests sitting in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts, if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the rufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve ourselves further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can create Wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to be cardiac due to seated activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are a real protective gel that can save one's life even though they don't know yet properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait, while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled about this concept I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is about an economic trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just a" "" "rent industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "share economy describes a trade, which promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is compared to fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if trips would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that you visited, a group would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a bar in a pub that one has never heard before.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from reason to come together?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared common?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine towns that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and deplotation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking that the government belonged,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now roommates were offered. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were passed to people whose children were withdrawn. there were incubator programs started.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, night is 785 000 people in 191 countries as a guest in a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was given to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just?</seg>
<seg id="248">Aside from luck and timing, we know that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can be able to use Design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A creditor? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, subjected to a brain-laundering, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>

<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, asked in question, doubted and believed in.</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>

<seg id="297">My shock changed rapidly into revolt.</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember, as we drove me -- as deep it went down in my seat, and I feared the first time that it was recognized as Muslim.</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to tell yourself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to ask questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are allegations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They are talking about my community like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor can only be seen under review.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are useless since the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, sthelers and Olympioniques.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will be the closure of mosques in America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will be perhaps a few parking, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to the people of other faith tolerant, and to show greater participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as me, as director of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people will actually not be radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalisation process one has found that he begins to start online. as a first, the person can make a brain-laundering, that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who suffice their behaviour and their ideology is a traitor or diverging by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must adhere to people to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination, if we recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-club clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology by their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if one casts a look at it, it doesn't drives what they lashed in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that she can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with a radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought her to silence and told her that her anger, their sense of the injustice in the world, she would only bring into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired by anything and something that would have given their anger sense, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke one solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam set the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of having taken her anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What they learned in the mosque, they kept before it to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals: when man reports on test messages, in which negative about Muslims reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you're looking at when the mood against Muslims from above - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war, and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to exploit the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling with Muslims is an early signal.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear smates us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective barence, it is not just about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was on the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous man he knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his life. she was stunned and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has been such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after making statements against Muslims on his facebook site.</seg>
<seg id="376">He took eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be only amoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We besought it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery, we drove silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanks and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered Christians were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Atheists, Believer and non-creditation who had come to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I fell unbroken.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion for panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those who mean, we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you would say those who might be claiming that you're holding a TEDTalk, a shepherd with draught, so an exception rather than not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, deceiving you not. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one can look at the Muslims around the world, and I did so with the study involved in Muslim men all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I do not have an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for Bastler, is shortly before to become a milliondenbusiness.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental surveillance, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-repercussions in our socially conscious consciousness has built a autonomous fleet of flying machines in France live in France a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By tightening plane, high speed and acceleration in the stem room.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-continuable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">Have learned to wear loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the utmost in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomous, it will need to know collectively where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on fast development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, one of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each airmachine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest bottom. B." "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficiently efficiently, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has a great advantage when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always one side-side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the device doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by exercising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often use basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of moveable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Two trained, trained, controlled airdriven devices, who had only two movable pieces: a propeller and a heckruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently discovered, we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No caster, hinges and cross-ruder, no further actuators or checker-surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inner life very much, so that it can fly to safe and move in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the heckor. to bring it to flying, I have to just throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of seeing it right properly if all watch me is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is a exercise in ingenious, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is not yet symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the great capability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is filmed or even how it rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is proficiable in models that the rest is learned directly with flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that again.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our day-day, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin-propeller airmachines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance square-Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, it goes wrong -- a motor or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, even though limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will then demonstrate that by doing a half flight.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic reserves.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous units, co-ordinated units makes possible a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and permit it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine at the end of Broadway wants to become a flying lamper system at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, how wonderful and conducts our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxie, two black holes are getting faster, they turned so the mass threw Sonnen in a tenths in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they sheped it brighter than all Stars together in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But your energy put them out in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed down into space-time fabric and the universe exploded in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially timeless.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was created just a majority of life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought a lot of things: coral, fish, plants, Saurian, people and -- God is standing by -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Approximately 25 years ago, a group decided to build a group of particularly bold -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - to build a huge laser detector to seek gravitational waves, that are approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as mad geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation was funded with their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of decades, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometric gravitational observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the time the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased, what the recognition of recognition could greatly improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, you call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run to clear some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collized black holes caused by the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my togill's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at the MIT. he has been examined for 23 years of gravitational waves out of black holes and their through observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cornerstone in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the same time, the wave will spread the space and its entire content into a direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, instructors in courses on the Relativity-theory often pose a really self-adhesive dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dusty, stretch and dusty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was pressed by us during the meeting of the waves and stressed. the Stretch of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1. Darum explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is absurd, then this length would be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus exactly. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are vast.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are final and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott holds her, LIGO is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: face extracts, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this way you can make a picture or a map of things going to perceive the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At killing, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that you particularly mean a lot:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we laugh at certain properties such as tape and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now is just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob suppbreaks them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple images of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the most common frequencies in audible area for LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert a wave in switching, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to laugh, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, my colleague Scott has already very long busy.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not twisting holes, circling simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional tone change. it sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of stick of movement, shaped into the wavelform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that has at least I never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrendes noise] Jemand who knows what to listen to he recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sunlight, which is about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think of what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 sun, revolve each hundred times a second, before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the remaining meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has an entirely new way to explore the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all the louder and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we are able to do -- practical or fundamentally -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masks stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes are happening at the core, which lies behind thousand kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon hidden.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, as this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the judgment is coverall through its own lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we don't have any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact I found LIGO out at the first stop things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, black holes produced, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so-called for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO allows us to completely different perspectives on the events in space, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I rehearsed an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do before I feared, freed, purifying my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life deeply, which was unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me once I could play with her than I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to my family. from there I got to play always with them as soon as you call me up. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I am always saying Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I feel very effortlessly.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a stunting side-effect: only recently I understood that the "yes" session to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am rocket. I think things you catch up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creative TV. I reproduciere television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for placing the 70 hours program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel may lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars of television, four hours of television, three episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours on TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursday nights.</seg>
<seg id="594">Throughout the world, my series production in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not only produced, so still obendpure. I have to find time, really stile, creative time to gather my fans of warfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, which are around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author."</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so all of you who work so hard, whether I speak of a company, a country or a classroom, when I speak of work, so you understand that I am not just around the computer, and fantasiere, and it is true when I say, I understand that it's not a dream of a dream vacation.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's when I put troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a snap a high tone, I supplied a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and oral, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take on when I'm giving them the sums, that I'm talking about writing, that writing my pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began with TV production, when I began to work and work, build, to create, and co-collaborating, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totals is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you cannot seek any other than the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different from the size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Sumy.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it means the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the Sumy.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make sure: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more watch me, the more I write history, all the more expectations there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I am carafe, the marathon, which I run, the army, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this Sumy. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the sums up.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, oversized, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums spent.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "Because, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a titani.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby title.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the motor is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't loved my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz came not returned.</seg>
<seg id="652">My totals was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, held weekends, no repentance, nothing delegate, a titude not delegate, is not on, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">However, there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what to do if that is what you do, the work you love, suddenly?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "haw you out of, blusher author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do what you do is doing a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the sums you feel when the sums stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern state waitress brought me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, and she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I get rid of it when I am Titan and called for my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is not special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "everbody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of money, I can do nothing except that.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am leise.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I am sagging, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and humid nuts, delicate voices, wax and song in which it appears to release, or whatever the girl in "The kingdgling is losed.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is capable of.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy push comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totality comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quietly, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the work environment, the Titanensing, which is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, if I'm describing the broadcasts and television-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real totality depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that is from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real totals is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums ignored the pressure of history, the tasks to enlightening tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I escaped God the false words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child will play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this generally, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice but I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not to be dusting me like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be home at work as well.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "I sincerely, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We ruminate in the garden, before and back, round and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smote Seifenblasen.</seg>
<seg id="735">And I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always run after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"" "" "" "my children show me how you live, and the sums of the universe met me." ""</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, till I ask myself: why have we ever stopped using the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! say they always say yes if your child would like to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">There you are probably right, but you can do it also!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My children want to play at most 15 minutes with me up to them, to make them something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes it replaced me a Marienkäfer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">And now my teenage daughter for 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Each can get 15 minutes each, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distractions.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it does not have to be the children. it's not the children to feel a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect at it. I failed and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan Poker training when I wanted to meet even more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get full 15 minutes each?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The summons came back in my spare time. the sums appear to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door open, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear my unfamiliar ody, it fills me and my soul. she leads me to new ideas. I took it to the full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap lasen and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my Sumy.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of the work is part of me but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is scrib to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better work I am working.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums, the marathon that I run, the troops, the canvases, the totals, the Sumy, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this Sumy, the more turns this unusual, aspiring, naked and new joie-feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am rocket. I think things from, I awakes you to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said 'yes' to less work and for more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after serious stroke, or after an automobile accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon is it very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was working for Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurochirurg?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep-irting stimulation." thereby, one can influence a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson which suffered under severe citations and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior consultant and worked on day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I accomodate patients with skull-Hiro trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata, the brain stimulated and the skull-pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to diminish the skull-pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, one sometimes has to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze us with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist to analyze the brain.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Being able to grow cells of a tissue balance is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts we managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That was what he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from the filologieunterricht that stem cells unmature cells are, which can transform itself into any cell type of the organism. "" "</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain cells in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells forsly changed.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread themselves and after a couple of weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">These cells are derived from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells represent Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You are making 4% of our large hirundrinding cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they kept us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe it will take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not that safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of bravest from the non-linguistic field and then the cells are as cultivating as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then it is colored mortal to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimpleated it to the duneal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reduce these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen if we reimpose the same cells in mating brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouff we were able to work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we moved an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells have preserved -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells, which were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain death?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual workstation.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a sturdy skill level, we completed in the motoric Cortex the Handmotions area.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then, the monkeys were paralyzed; they could no longer move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, she recovered spontaneously up to some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brainism. they are recovering to some degree, just as at the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we pleaded his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkey that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see the cells reimpleated: the same monkey, two months after the irritation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to impose them on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I am in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run these types of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate the treatments it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thanks for your visit at TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake, it as a course of granted.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventaris of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as unchangeable poetry.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is inevitably led to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great offspring in Beijing have undoubtedly proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is waning with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- to influence the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my inflated friends who would tell me that democracy would change if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in cooperation with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an error, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are in common, our future lies dark and our great, new technologies will be wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">For the topic of waste, I want to point out to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twins" paradox "paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet, few recognize his twins.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is however too anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and incomes, with which one could put the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion invested US dollars, invested in all the wealthiness goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars is equivalent to a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time compares in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twins summit, which are not equivocal by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low venous economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who is out of fear that the prophecy of the Orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unawakened the circumstances bring about that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hadern with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His extremely merbial Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, improve human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue, What do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the outside and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed many of them --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to minate the significance of the Athenic democracy due to these closures.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision in the Athenian democracy was and is that they entered the working arms, and not only has the right to freedom of speech, but more important and crucial that they gave them the right to political codetermination with the same voting for questions of the prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly expanded.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our liberal democracies have not been their roots in the ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy had only emerged as a complete separation of politics and business, and the democratic process has been incorporated into politics, while the economy has become the world of corporations -- a democracy in democracy.</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies, there is time in which this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two rather than the economy is beginning to migrate the policy and deducted them." ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not located on a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because one can be in the government nowadays and still not in power because the power of politics is interviewed in the economy and separated the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hadern with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about just like a flock of robbery who, so sustainably the animals from which they nourished, that they are starvation at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy, which has become so far cannified by the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are degenerated, inequality increases, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of the corporations are too anxiously to invest the cash out of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism sells the "Demos" [the people] the higher the twin-summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "" "" "if this is true, it is obvious that the politics and the economy must come together again, and it would be better if the" "" "Demos" "" "control, so as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea nearly 100 years ago and it didn't work well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching from the deacon of the Soviet Union should be that the toilers are getting to regain only a position like in the ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to create the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of twins will be higher, the waste of harness and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we need to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and thereby guaranteeing the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a hospital surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dystopy, or is similar to the human being in the "Star Trek" or through something that are used to human beings into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">What about what could it look like to have this "star Trek" -like utopia than the "matrix" -similar ystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to provide you with some examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask for a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a workstation to next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one has just worked -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derives from capital and income, and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong, but do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and expenses, and ultimately no upraging twins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce yourselves that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 biggest emerging countries] in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is acted -- we call it "the cosmos" in units of "Cosmos" -- and any government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also in mind that this fund has invested in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes was proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time we were not able to implement the technical means.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have in particular the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world which I describe to you is at the same time liberally, in which they privileged people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynote, globally keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else there is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar diocopy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as a libertary Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just told is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do not do that, the technological development will generate a massive decline in general economic demand, what Larry Summers are referred to as" long term stagnation. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Also like Hayek, therefore I am a Libertist Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally entertained.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are also at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you do not, you do not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think about the vision of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited the democracy on politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the field of business -- is a completely democracy zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I must say that provocative, China resembles China today to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism to democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical as concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can observe now in China is very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now suggest that to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells by hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listener am curious to your experience as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely from complacency to the complacency, and the constant denial made a massive destruction line through the euro zone, and continues to go massive that threatens the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to be chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries a economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be hesitant for a while, but if change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister named after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he claims he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Naturally I made mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed it had an honest interest in the sides of the creditors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to put our government on the case only because they didn't want to deal with the wrong ones that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to confess that for 5 years they have experienced a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal voltage.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none from the Troika of the donors who raised this policy was a" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive team of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone from someone who lives and loves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for if they do not survive, the forces will be released and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This is not alone for Europe to have catastrophic consequences, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the way of a postmodern 1930, which it appears to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are going wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thanks for that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy price, most of them have never heard, although it is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for much of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This is going back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for putting the shows and content to produce Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard rebattling industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located very right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows such as Breaking Bad," "" "Game of Thrones" "", "The Wire," "" "-- all the shows, addicted where, after having a season, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to accommodate "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes up more thoughts about the medium output, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor negative, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something, so Roy will not risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He takes a guarantee success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selected by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch any free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is out of course, you are attacking it right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators see these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know that they are observed when looking at these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pauses, which parts you skip, or look again or again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and from it results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of that show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it does not seem to remember many of this show because she was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only a average-show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of that curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something on average, but not exactly what was attached to Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top-show through data analytics. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team has viewed the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows you like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find these small details about the spectators: which shows you like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series on a broadator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards" "". "Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very knowledgeable, data sealed.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic were wise, that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years to statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimized it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis is not working then this is something frightening, because we are living in a time when we draw more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in the US in the U.S. and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of seated companies are already wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announce that it is known by data analysis breakthroughs of flu, fluvial art, presupposes -- by means of data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success comes in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawless, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work out anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these mistakes the data circulates in decisions of life - in the workplace, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Even I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area with which some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have realized a few patterns over the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">You have to solve a complex problem, you do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, you put this problem in its parts, so that you can analyze the items; as a date put the items back together to summarise a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and resume.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suited to resist the parts again and then come into a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something there is good in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces come back again, even if the information is incomplete -- particularly when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also go in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why otherwise they would not have been able to understand, but the decision on how to take all of these parts, and make it a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, what meant they were a big personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the contrary, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they competed by TV ideas then they chose "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision, because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool and in order not to forget that this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it gave data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or no question, you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will become it later with a Technikdemo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, while I should listen to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much more energetic, such as data analysis, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball dance and dark and dark. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data is still paying off to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks associated with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
