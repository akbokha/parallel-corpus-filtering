Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your look at the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where to meet young people today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now buried for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people cultiv@@ ate the one @-@ term basis of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official card coin rolls exciting stories to day .
it is more nerv@@ ously when maps are not currently up .
this knows each who had to thr@@ illing themselves , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i was held instead of a revers@@ ing way a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , is anything but current - but this is why it is very enligh@@ tening .
especially if you compare them with current on @-@ line cards .
then , clearly , as towns and churches have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas that recogni@@ zes man as such .
in the great flood@@ .@@ postcard have been conceived for towns and villages , so @-@ called Ur@@ position@@ ists ,
these originated according to the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping of the first Ver@@ mess@@ ung Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader in Bayern since the spring 1800 during the Second Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ ing war with Austria .
Napoleon did an overview of the occupied country and gave an to@@ po@@ graphical survey of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes .
even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph continued to advance the project , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ po@@ graphical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charter sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of fruits / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ missions , which appear in the map of 18@@ 56 yet relatively isolated .
ship@@ yard was sentenced to 21 years after the development of the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district .
today sub@@ missions lies in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ missions focus around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 by Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : on the first glance : with do@@ zens of do@@ zens lines and numbers : hand@@ writing number@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; certificate , &quot; derived from the base tax .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots do not show farmers more - but small gar@@ dener of the facility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is set north of sub@@ missions .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 graph@@ ed in the October 19th century , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of the psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the district of district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the district of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , you will not only read the road name &quot; on the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the altitude &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ way people once block people with mad@@ ness .
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; At the Au@@ er Lü@@ ch . &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard de G@@ ud@@ den brought the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is being brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the purchase of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is also banned by the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition of the Anst@@ alt .
for 280 patients had first place first , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime this capacity is no longer due - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of the biggest psychiat@@ rist@@ s of Germany .
the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt is now meeting young people in the Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ anum .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned him into a teen@@ ager with appr@@ enti@@ ces .
West is located of the football field of the TS@@ V Munich , east , east of the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa don Bosco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was set up by the children of House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in architectural design based on the country of origin , which had been destroyed during World War II during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Marien@@ platz was awarded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merch@@ ant road was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change led the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 , many holes in the city centre .
a big remained to the present day - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English Institut , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages had once been on Marien@@ hof , where these days will be the pre @-@ work and scheduled for the second S @-@ Bahn line on 5 April 2017 .
the layer of Munich can be compared to the old Munich card with the a@@ erial view of today - and fill the hole in the Marien@@ hof .
citizens of the voucher for Miss@@ ouri
the national union to promote color @-@ tone has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Miss@@ ouri based on the discrimin@@ atory policies and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Miss@@ ouri , who will take into force until 28 August 2017 , invites A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and mis@@ ou@@ ri@@ ans , since a series of frag@@ ile , ra@@ zz@@ ling @-@ based deposits have occurred recently in the entire state and described here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently passed law of Miss@@ ouri , which makes it harder to gain a discrimin@@ atory claim , as well as the prosec@@ ution of the state , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate on minorities , promp@@ ted the group to give the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the civil rights that people happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are har@@ med because of their skin colour , they are mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ ouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such cases we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that issued an organization for a state in the United States .
the group of inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist contra@@ sts against black students at the University of Miss@@ ouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died at un@@ question@@ ably circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gas@@ oline at the beginning of the year and was taken in cust@@ ody by the police of Miss@@ ouri in cust@@ ody without a crime .
the Council also pointed out to a recent report by the office of the General State of Miss@@ ouri , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than stri@@ ches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Miss@@ ouri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring it up or let the relatives go through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ ouri grew 100 Hass@@ an in the year 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate speech of the F@@ BI that appears the state in relation to the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country .
the travel cancellation is also an answer to a new Miss@@ ouri law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ Union ( AC@@ SI ) had issued any travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed the immigration laws affecting local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to people for immigration , which according to the AC@@ LU on further seg@@ reg@@ ation .
travel war@@ nings are generally issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ project is elementary
the fisher@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ aun @-@ Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have provided an image in front of the place .
at the Recht@@ excav@@ ation of the family Schwen@@ de@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U place , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann lod@@ ged first insights into its operation , in which it covers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest en@@ eb@@ ed , 40 milk , and as many young people , and houses in five apartments of Feri@@ eng@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ mil@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ er path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ es only comes local .
since he is also a pro @-@ president of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he referred the Wei@@ z@@ aun@@ projekt as &quot; elem@@ ental . &quot;
I can not build on such steep areas not profitable .
the green area is a lot of work , much of which can be edited using the Motor@@ sense .
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and crops this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ tiliz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bio@@ farm .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the dec@@ ay project and is pleased with the leaders . &quot;
the costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per h@@ ect@@ are would have to support farmers .
we hope that the re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of the areas could be carried out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
over the past@@ ries support , in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the disclosure area is 40 hectares , which must not be un@@ en@@ for@@ ted up to at least 20@@ 23 .
from the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half over Leader is funded , a quarter carried the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus , they con@@ du@@ red the farmers 12 610 Euros , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac empha@@ sized : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Care ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of ordination .
the objective is the offensive @-@ holding of the Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ ds .
prere@@ quis@@ ites are the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked funding .
in addition , the en@@ closures of the area should not be worse . ( hang@@ ings over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation .
for the fisher@@ man Wei@@ del@@ aun@@ project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build up at almost 16 kilometres fence .
the disclosure area is 35 hectares , which are low @-@ calculated costs with more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty at
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to push the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the car@@ ef@@ ree of Saddam H@@ uss@@ eins on the Fir@@ en Platz in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key inv@@ olo@@ gues of the tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a sad dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals by the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of the legal migration with the statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not take the statue itself .
a Hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ occup@@ ants and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have suffered him if he had done it .
but he att@@ ained their importance , and in particular the importance that it was written than the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base has been added .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that has illumin@@ ated the world .
the poem on which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is knowled@@ geable , but as he de@@ form@@ ated it , it does not really matter of history .
it is about the contemporary response to the dis@@ continued words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your arms , who longing for it , freely to breathe , / the flowing waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ astic waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our scre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller committed himself not in liter@@ ary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation , it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who translated their words to their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism , indic@@ ating the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives himself a different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus the meaning of the statue changed , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great Wr@@ ite R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the dec@@ eption for the com@@ ump of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ alim@@ entary that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of the perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhau@@ stive but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips to the de@@ cks of ships .
it &apos;s true that the world is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refu@@ ge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that you would ever want to recognise .
her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the path , but the hate , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
World@@ championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds us of a time when only two vill@@ i belonging to the team of Great Britain
the founder &apos;s founder of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of sc@@ ott@@ ish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland develops something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ eten thinks that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the sc@@ ott@@ ish athletes , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to team team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is pretty modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and were very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the real feel that E@@ ili@@ dh brought quite naturally , were magnificent . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ alli@@ er winning player who will compete at its fifth World Championship with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; unbelievable , &quot; that 16 Sch@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best whole ath@@ lets at the World Championship was seven , the 1983 and 2015 have been reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mu@@ ir faces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5,000 m run@@ ners .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are who runs 1,@@ 500 m is another shot you should observe after a great season , which should include victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the Mann@@ ists E@@ geri@@ es says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud of &quot; the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the finals .
&quot; the special thing to be a team of team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor to know , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to Po@@ des .
what my speech to be referred to as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block reviews on Facebook : be@@ wir@@ ing you not for a public post if you can not wear the influ@@ x of voters
the father of our country knew anything of the poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him for everything , from internal politics to his political principles .
he swe@@ pt in criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and wor@@ dless , we are led like the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to govern@@ or Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who must work on to be more like Washington .
the iconic employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and er@@ ased that their opinion is vo@@ iced on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties def@@ endant him at the beginning of this week .
the rod of the govern@@ or had the law@@ suit as free@@ zing , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprising .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very happy to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head on chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ade of individuals who come to the govern@@ or of the govern@@ or - who is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by collabor@@ ators who are paid by public tax funds - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post of Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Amelia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the block@@ ade of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ens @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the lash @-@ way .
the post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are just real people who are speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not a role .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thought@@ fully and not profound .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeal to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer , Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked to Hass@@ an Hass@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I met polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take on the same subject , they are ab@@ used by some more than a so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the govern@@ or as &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ discussion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocked a cr@@ itic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that staff was sent to gather newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and to burn or to get rid of demonstr@@ ators , and to silence them .
but that is just digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is s@@ cour@@ ted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this matter was the last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County missed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District ters James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they called a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit of the AC@@ SI because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect like the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ s@@ cribe to his leadership .
and even at that time the Washington an anonymous t@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people that p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Valeri@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Valeri@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Washington &apos;s choices made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which critic@@ ized its position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping , according to the U.@@ K. , according to historical documents gathered by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , opinion and dis@@ course belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans Nr. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for the next three days on domestic comfort , since Renaissance Club at East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the Ar@@ cher@@ field left at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until the En@@ dr@@ unde , is associated with the new Austr@@ ag@@ ungs@@ ort and func@@ tioned as a tournament shar@@ eholder in the name of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os ... Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved its glory with this event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Re@@ ached . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best page , he is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is an aw@@ kward advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels particularly , &quot; said the South@@ port native player .
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open as she won in the year after I had won them out of the program .
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior tour , returns to action on a hom@@ etown .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to make it good , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ster@@ ile by Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ lt
less humans have died in the past two decades due to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ lt of lung cancer .
this is a result of scientists from the University of University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year in 167 lung cancer are attri@@ but@@ able to Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ oks , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said study managers Heiko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved from her own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time there were 400 lung cancer , because of Passi@@ v@@ rau@@ oks per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house@@ ke@@ eper prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and are somewhat reasonably in time , &quot; thus the leader of the court of Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house cir@@ cuits , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , much promised , which is not in the plans .
the traffic that is always hin@@ der again the construction works , poses a big issue for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of motor@@ ists before red traffic lights and un@@ lock is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the line buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with working at the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very nice already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were taken by our friend Fritz Matt with cooler mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i co@@ oks the dinner , she uses no stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indon@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - local as a &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the cr@@ acks will have taken tu@@ bers with s@@ fri@@ ght , un@@ covered hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - it has no furniture - where they also perform their daily work , e.g. d@@ resses with tr@@ unks of water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as Lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives their hus@@ bands were assigned any fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody w@@ ning it before getting around 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was placed in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 el@@ dest should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
a existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta that holds control of the region and excluded foreign journalists or humor .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Gu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as gathered the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19.@@ 000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo pul@@ ses , and out of cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were transm@@ uted through R@@ ost in several yellow @-@ brown notes .
only very few Indon@@ esian they have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , schol@@ ars P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans was a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indon@@ esian po@@ orer Province where 28 % of people living under the poverty line , and some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates are in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ nation@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has built a value of 3.@@ 1 billion U.S. dollar gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which assure that Indon@@ esian milit@@ ant military has retained an in@@ feed presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort tot@@ aled local military and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and will be treated gr@@ ac@@ ess .
according to activists killed , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military , tor@@ tured and det@@ ained .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal in 1970 @-@ 15 years were brought to gen@@ oci@@ des in the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police took over the last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accept Every@@ thing in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ b@@ ane from the year 2016 where reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electric stro@@ kles are especially popular after another report - and the brutal ra@@ inf@@ all peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have intensified as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing , as Muslim officials from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ ines sell br@@ at@@ enes chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ sau@@ ce .
local people are fighting for joining here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua for sale , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , which moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama &apos;s M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the ine@@ qualities and the infrin@@ gements in Pap@@ ua .
the former St@@ ater@@ rit@@ te 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and now the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we have agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
actually Pan@@ i@@ ai has actually suffered a low point for two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on 7 December 2014 was a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the ro@@ cked children told them they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took up on their tone and came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , h@@ unted and sm@@ ote the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers in the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , became so hard when he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby federal commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military force centre to challenge justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial Jag@@ ni@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle regularly and a bir@@ d@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as army P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military post .
when the mood had been heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for rest and urged the amount to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned myself , I suddenly became shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he shared TIME on the ver@@ anda of his colour@@ ful wooden house .
Kay@@ ame knows still not , who has failed , but tells us that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the here gathered soldiers .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fi@@ red , &quot; he adds .
the native man of Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and sear@@ ched his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esian only has one name , the TIME in d@@ une mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters , that his officers wanted their station only &quot; secure &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wo@@ unds .
the messages about the k@@ ill@@ ings were only fil@@ tered on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in which he sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ elling the historical mis@@ conditions in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that in the future it will no longer happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
safety in@@ ister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he entered an extra@@ judicial mechanism to conf@@ use historical human rights ab@@ uses .
but the pay@@ outs began almost immediately .
&quot; most violations are occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are trials which must run through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Will made a retreat when he spoke out at the 5th of June in Jak@@ arta with TIME and said , he did not set any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , the UN for crimes against humanity &quot; indic@@ ted the more than 1,000 deaths in East tim@@ ors of bloody independence before 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua have already been buried , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims assume such alleg@@ ations of severe un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he was still alive in fear for years .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested from the military , have fear to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that men in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring an un@@ conscious man in the hospital , died a person and 17 others were wo@@ unded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year r@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he walked in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
elev@@ ated vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the location office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , who re@@ acted upon it by hum@@ id war@@ ts .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian police ) began to shoot the amount of shoot and a fatal .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i , who lives nearby the hospital and witn@@ essed how the last here is quickly delivered , so TIME .
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a glorious government for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal army , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many adh@@ ered to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by alle@@ vi@@ ate spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and ab@@ duc@@ tions of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ e@@ Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to these years thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and at random in cust@@ ody , under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as different as possible .
the people here build everything they eat : above all not@@ a and fruit and leaf gland .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit only four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted just 10.000 in@@ don@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities vary between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new Flu@@ te Airport .
the few jobs that are there in the area , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or skills to make their own companies competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation is keeping the eyes of the world away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported by lac@@ klu@@ ft institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given rare permission to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is Elec@@ tions , were advised to raise the limitations of reporting to foster transparency and development .
&quot; there are new haz@@ ards to foreign journalists who try to report from Indon@@ esian un@@ com@@ for@@ ting provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua are trying to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ stic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , the &quot; different and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting range .
the same countries have historically viewed the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ issed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local governments want to take note of more foreign governments .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ amb@@ assador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May visited , bra@@ kes locals and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the session but will remain anonymous .
Indonesia , 2019 has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua would say that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sha@@ de , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from that , under the constant threat of a sham@@ anic military lives , is in arm@@ ing educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; he must re@@ pay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations carried out a final symbolic act of the f@@ ool : the cor@@ pse of a sacrifice was buried on a terrain right across the police and the military station .
they might know that perhaps righteousness is not coming up , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; one member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a sal@@ ary head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cover the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ apers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai its di@@ ear@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that has been swe@@ pt in only two years by the Hoch@@ haus , which is called for the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injury were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are up at the fire alarm and scre@@ ens people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor to the bottom , &quot; told a resident who got his name as George &apos;s , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ai civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 2 : 00 GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cool@@ ed .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can repeat questions about safety of materials that are used in outside areas of skyscr@@ apers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest portion of damages from the cas@@ ing , the out@@ lining for decoration or insulation ;
in Britain , the police said the police , they believe that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ce in June , with which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has been with his great Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h city , the Centre for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposition was supported by these sports revolutionary suggestions , Davis Cup dispos@@ es only on two winning ess@@ ays , W@@ af@@ er does not support the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classics therefore remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only slightly f@@ law@@ ed .
&quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members do not have adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to work on improving the applic@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at all , not only for the vote was that the proposal came to spread the finals on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively minor details : this will the fin@@ alists at the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host of the host in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs of the event , the requirements are reli@@ eved in terms of training exercises , etc . and players will have to be completed in front of the Davis Cup less official media dates .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bringing forbidden objects into the airplane , a survey takes place
a survey conducted in passengers sur@@ rendered that more than 20 percent are conscious of the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration passes by at least 6 percent , who mar@@ ry the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally b@@ aked kni@@ ves or other items with blade holders .
less than 1 % said , they would have noticed that they were irrit@@ ated with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - that was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ atos Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also set that younger travellers tend to dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents they gave that they did not kno@@ w@@ ingly sought to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items found in T@@ SA agents were deliber@@ ately presented at T@@ SA agents , were food and liqui@@ ds .
more than 3 percent le@@ vies be kno@@ w@@ ingly worn by the safety control , while 2.2 percent of female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirm that they would clearly dis@@ rupt drugs into the plane .
the company said it has asked travellers around the country to find out how many vers@@ ed sm@@ ug@@ gling mal@@ ware brought by the airport security and how many it would have done .
it is not a surprise that the people , the most productive sm@@ ug@@ gling , kno@@ w@@ ingly or not kno@@ w@@ ingly - by the safety of those who were most often flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often in@@ secure , what liqui@@ ds are allowed to take or how much of it .
thus , there is no surprise that the largest amount of liqui@@ ds were caused by the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated items .
for a while , the people , the T@@ SA could see books as a sm@@ ug@@ gling ware .
liqui@@ ds are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elektro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to meet the huge number of cav@@ ities for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to date , he has so far to suggest that a part of the customer has already returned its non @-@ binding reservation again .
apart from the continually tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers to sales growth and more gigantic break@@ through@@ s , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number mar@@ ry : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k has frequently used in recent months with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .
now Mus@@ k has been built : from the total of 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 has already been with@@ drawn again .
critics were always pointed out to be non @-@ binding reservations .
at a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations in front , spatial mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts one .
that cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders may become a problem , the Tes@@ la Chef does not believe .
its argument is the challenge of the ambitious growth goals , not in demand but on the production site .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles supplied .
by 2018 , it should be composed - all models combined - 500@@ ,000 to 2020 for a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k currently there are 1800 reservations for this purpose .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may anticip@@ ate at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la es creates , his brand new , never in practice tested with no greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utili@@ zation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but it comes to larger delays , then the non@@ committ@@ al of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .

one day after he had been l@@ aments of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , his previous decision back to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions sm@@ og hy@@ n@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented change as its agency dedicated to the needs of state environmental authorities to respond more quickly than previous vulner@@ abilities .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a Federal Cultural Court .
it is a deadline that ran up on 1 October for states to stop the standards of 2015 for mineral resources .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will be hes@@ it@@ ant for a year to study the plan and avoid the plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engage in local decisions or economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed president of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump So@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma for a long time , was a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ ff has repeated repeatedly to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden stop from Wednesday is the most recent legal consultation for the roadmap of regulatory tur@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in Washington decided that the EPA @-@ administrator has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ ane &apos;s cks .
in one on the Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ff suggested that his turn@@ around on O@@ zon@@ standards is simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous vulner@@ abilities the EPA often has maintained the dead@@ lines for carrying out groups and others , and subsequently call for an agreement to set out the appointment for the execution &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who l@@ ament@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that we give us seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion expressed by the EPA , that sometimes his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority for delay and any other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use will be used to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a wider new version of the O@@ zon@@ ing .
one last month approved leg@@ alization should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made available at the Senate .
the New York &apos;s general state lawyer , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who ruled the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - after our charges - is an important profit to the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the sm@@ og that flows into their communities , &quot; said C@@ utting .
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created if poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil ble@@ eding , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the advanced smok@@ y can cause serious breathing problems with sensitive groups of people serious breathing problems , and each year will contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health as well as the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered at the age of a surprising course change .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling , how much pressure it takes to preserve this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Government &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the environment of pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

society wants to examine the permit of Win@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim hon@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned aside to the land Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; elected to take its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette even no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen merely on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there is a Wind@@ force concentration zone .
within this concentration @-@ zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentration @-@ concentration @-@ zone , but an exp@@ ul@@ sion of wind turbines for the remaining city area .
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
although a few days ago , the town of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind power@@ ing zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , but did not appro@@ ve the District government in Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ fault .
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal requirements , the author@@ ization of author@@ ization is still illegal , and therefore also back , &quot; said Christopher Erk@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council entered again the wind @-@ centr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a permit of the District government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cold : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are plan@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been made during the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
but they do not likely perform that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express himself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build a surface area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette for the construction of four each 200 metres high Win@@ ds .
already last year the company had been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , pun@@ ctu@@ ation agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great yel@@ lowing .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the electricity demand for around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds with approximately one @-@ fifth of the power supply of all quad@@ ru@@ ple households .
the NEW Re want to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
Auto and tractor together : Frau dies at an aw@@ kward accident
one aw@@ ful traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman has been mort@@ ally inju@@ red .
two other people were easily inju@@ red .
the provincial road remained locked over hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took over a 17 @-@ year mother with her 53 @-@ year mother as a companion , the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September .
the commercial association and the Munici@@ pal Author@@ ities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8th and 9th of September to attract the residents for the shopping @-@ stroll into the city centre .
as the Chairman of the commercial association , Christian king , announced the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend , the &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend was to sens@@ it@@ ise the clients that swe@@ eps the own city from the usual Super@@ market goods .
in fact , the market is planned with regional distributors , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , the companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eshi@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city is to invite for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ tern@@ ach@@ ts @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action aimed not only on residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag that point out to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian König .
Munici@@ pal Author@@ ities and commercial association co@@ operates with the industry and Chamber of Commerce .
this makes the commercial association and the city into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Brun@@ nen@@ fest Sunday , talks with all trad@@ es@@ men and hosts in order to take them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and verification on parking fee at this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be renewed again or again .
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the inner city at shopping .
in the end , all would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories around the city and clubs .
it came to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y who made some broad , had left the king in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , director of the I@@ HK Center in Mühl@@ hausen divided that , on the nation@@ wide third &quot; home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; Day , took part in the first time five Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day shall advertise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the esteem of the local trade and its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the Feder@@ ations of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also make it clear that every citizen can influence its direct and direct environment on their own .
two t@@ ote and multiple exp@@ editions after explosion at US @-@ school
during construction , there was an explosion of gas in the school building .
new more people have been wo@@ unded .
in an explosion of gas in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine were wo@@ unded , some of them heavy .
according to the fire@@ brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was one more recently in critical condition .
a man died as part of a school building upon the explosion .
one first of all is missing then dead born later .
at the dead were employees of the school .
as un@@ lucky @-@ item suspected the authorities work on a gas line .
during the holiday season only few people stopped in the building of the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump continued to call on trans@@ duc@@ ted trans@@ cription by phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border .
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a call with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to listen , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned fron@@ tier wall .
the US President accused him , because he had previously predicted the wall publicly . and he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the US , and sw@@ or to pay Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ hart have also been released and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ hart , that trade for US refugees who came to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; fool@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the c@@ ess@@ ation on the trade that was introduced by the Obama Administration to let him look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr Turn@@ hart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and sm@@ iled to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men joined forces in order to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man in middle age in a needle @-@ stroke - took a long train to its cig@@ ar and looked after by the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ ears the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ül@@ ed the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l it from the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie was tor@@ n the silence , as a young black man from the passenger .
fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on 22 July was just a post@@ ure .
but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is almost all in the audience very real sor@@ row .
since 2005 , civil right to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever indic@@ ted because of the mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years not a single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in organizing the after@@ position .
&quot; it is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the State of Georgia and a life long side@@ ler .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that wrong never was corrected .
&quot; we want prosec@@ ution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tri@@ bun@@ cle puts a du@@ le@@ cloth on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI Ak@@ ten , who received from N@@ BC News have been received more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding villages in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free walking for decades to say , the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions around the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice has allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , at the pre@@ selection of their voice in the summer .
about at the same time as choosing the F@@ BI of black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a fight down - sup@@ pos@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby they carried , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from jail , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed himself from prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge revol@@ ted , around a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b around the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it turns out was Har@@ rison that has prepared and arranged the mor@@ de , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a Compl@@ ete between the state and local law enforcement , which was not just involved in the murder , evi@@ d@@ ently reported proof and the identity of witnesses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more striking .
&quot; it was a voting re @-@ mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost a decade long Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post @-@ presentation of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is vi@@ vid , po@@ ign@@ ing and substanti@@ ated in a kind of deep racism , many believe that he does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to look at , and still more difficult to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we then are confronted with its ugly in us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have made . &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen grain and the rest of the bl@@ acks - into a room and lou@@ der , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ made overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ tern for years , but he said , the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story alive because we don &apos;t want to go back to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester are playing their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the test@@ ers , and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- er , mer@@ win@@ de of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona en@@ qu@@ es the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ arm@@ ing and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ick@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , wit@@ ched one of the other black performers .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shi@@ fts in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene does not begin again .
this time As@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely nobody laughs .
this repet@@ ition will end violent and fast .
there is fri@@ ght , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a grap@@ e @-@ dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs cheap holidays sad to speak , &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
a pair is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the road .
they have experienced every eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture as Bro@@ oks results on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ b@@ ites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the Mor@@ de remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de stores , the air feels mir@@ ac@@ ing .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the ly@@ ch@@ name .
children ho@@ cken on their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes he thanks Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ x &apos;s away and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move , who played the c@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks into her arms , the emotional load of the performance breaks out eventually with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ per one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience will get together with the actors for dinner .
in a table a white pair of Atlanta comes along with the im@@ position with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words that left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and who do what they look as you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ g@@ chen still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , that is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police @-@ shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and remembered the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the im@@ position is inspir@@ ational , for it describes the fri@@ ght of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I get a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as Vol@@ unte@@ er
they work in their volunte@@ ering year at several places .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture scene , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the school for an open day @-@ day work .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer .
how does it come ?
quantity : I made a diplom@@ a .
and then a building studies , we say once , successfully completed .
I realized for me that it &apos;s the Fal@@ se for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what you are doing .
do a social year , there is a look , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter term in social affairs .
I will study dual , doing some social worker education and at school in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not unusual during the volunteer services to have several different areas of application ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends on where you do his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim through to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , thus in the after@@ care .
for me that was exactly the right thing that has stir@@ red me .
I could see and see my own strengths and see how it really is going on .
unlike in the design @-@ engineer ?
quantity : well , here it is not about to reck@@ ons an extra .
one always has other people in the head who each have a different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been picked up from the family - you always have to enter individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations about ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are also some negative moments , but so life is .
Pear@@ son short@@ ened more than 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to recover the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will dismant@@ le more than 3.000 percent and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressures in which the company is facing .
the job building , the Director General John Fall@@ on predomin@@ ate predomin@@ antly for late 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , has been lost in 4,000 places already .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction programme to cost further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was taken by a quick step toward digital learning .
the company that expressed its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om &apos;s House on the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half @-@ year saw a rise of 1 percent to 3.8 billion pounds .
Kon@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier &apos;s soldier in self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ ination
a su@@ icide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldiers of N@@ ato killed and several other inju@@ red , say officials .
five soldiers and a interpre@@ ter were inju@@ red , distributed an explanation of the N@@ ato .
un@@ confirmed local reports died in the incident in the quarter of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has made this month - on Tuesday evening more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday the su@@ icide attacks of two people close to the Iraqi message in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion the N@@ ato is said to happen , the explosion on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol age with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; by people car@@ ved explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
the statement states that all the last in a stable state are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a grave concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian out@@ breaks , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ bom@@ b ended at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite distribution of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
on May 31st , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the town was more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the U.S. led troops had displ@@ aced the power of power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to delay the sm@@ og rule by charges
the American Environment Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , abol@@ ishing that the states are obliged to prevent the sm@@ og &apos;s sm@@ og emissions . this took place a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency because of the p@@ ac@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive to the so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zon@@ provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it is the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the EPA in June to specify the O@@ zone regulations in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ants to determine where in@@ cis@@ ions have to be made to delay more str@@ ingent aircraft standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , held on Tuesday K@@ lage , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental effects that former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to stimulate economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the proposal of Democrats and democr@@ acies that worry about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone is containing &quot; the lung function and reinforce the symp@@ tom symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma .
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ party cho@@ oses the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ winds the establishment of a joint period in the future sen@@ iors .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining parts of the property was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it is still going to be until the so far the church community belonged to the congreg@@ ation in the municipal ownership , but there is now no planning representative for that of a private investor to make a leading project more .
there is a discussion about a joint space .
one of the two investors , which are still in the boat , has offered to meet the congreg@@ ation .
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters area for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council rests , such a common area not just as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but open to the congreg@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision that has been decided by providing funds for the ongoing household already last autumn by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a communal space would be , so reported tu@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the decision @-@ proposal is to signal the investor , that one wants to throw him in this respect no bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both in the environment - which reduces the ambient temperature - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which makes the foot@@ ing reduced and the construction of economic power - it would be possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously , he happens the body .
it is not that simple when it comes to common areas .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one should not move so quite , for that Leh@@ ne one is now in common room from the window , she says , &quot; I do not make me hard with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yvonne Sta@@ iger am definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looks behind it a cover@@ t pay@@ out to any case of domestic or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , it will be a real , in doubt the market @-@ related , the object is referred to .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers Form , the decre@@ e proposal , will find three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in case of two counter@@ parts in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ising : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a giant @-@ step in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of its team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not good at last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season .
&quot; soccer is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; tricky &quot; game . &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spect@@ ators , divided the German football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday with .
to the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide first &quot; star@@ ring ad &quot; is to be created .
this is part of the Club of the Ob@@ servatory of Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet@@ arium goes in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star @-@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be contrary to the information of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he mix@@ es nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to sit along the planned route and inform you about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well att@@ ain@@ able installations to five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question@@ ing of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on boards should be added by internet .
therefore , in the location of the location , a good mobile network is playing a role .
also barrier @-@ free is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ base path should be extended by train .
&quot; at the star@@ ring ad , the spect@@ ators learn a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they also learned how many stars would have different colours or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , although he is much more distant .
let , in which con@@ stellation I will find a chosen star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest ob@@ servatory of Northern Germany .
the site in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z counts as one of the federal government to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with mere eye can be seen .
in the university city since 2003 there has been a initiative of sustain@@ ing Planet@@ arium Göttingen some simil@@ arity like the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planet@@ en@@ weg path .
beginning before Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inner of our solar system , leads the Planet@@ en@@ weg with his st@@ els up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Munici@@ p@@ ality of Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ alls with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ Plan@@ ets de@@ gra@@ dient Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are accurately positioned at a distance and a scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres diameter , while the exact 75 meters away the sun is still 70 centi@@ meters measures .
the entire distance of the planet @-@ we@@ ges amounts to a good four kilometers .
while the light of sun needs to Plu@@ to , about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour until the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star , but would still be a half year .

Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia should stand in a coll@@ ision in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .

Gar@@ cia stretched forth the right hand and said , &quot; How do you go ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko will defend his belt on Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair of photographs pos@@ ited , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect size &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko un@@ anim@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight a date with a 135 pound server at this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their athle@@ tic tit@@ el match in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed themselves openly in the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , he appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a tremendous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the tri@@ m champion of River@@ side , &quot; very slowly made , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to try the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show strength , then boxes .
both said , they could sense the momentum , which he built up for his own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and excitement .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four P@@ last to tire plat@@ eau
on Thursday afternoon four people were inju@@ red on Thursday afternoon .
after first information lost the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 4.30 pm shortly before the connecting point of market , probably after an tire plat@@ eau the control over his vehicle .
the passenger @-@ truck to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he attacked and then lying on the roof of the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RI@@ FE@@ N .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were inju@@ red during the accident .
during the initial supply of the past through the rescue service , the A7 is locked in direction to the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be presented at the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes led after 2 : 2 to the season @-@ up against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first start of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there would not have been the two oppos@@ es at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to adapt even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defen@@ ders of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the Dre@@ ier@@ chain should also be further optim@@ ised .
and a door after an open place , the e@@ ast@@ o@@ ons want to be cle@@ ared together even no longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew depends on the experiences in the preparation with the three @-@ sized chain , than with the four @-@ ring chain .
&quot; still , I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we have just over half @-@ positions in the mid @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Niko lad@@ der players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ condition is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ise and we do not afford as many def@@ lec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you decided to speak after a bank@@ ru@@ ined start , I do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; argu@@ ed Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can focus on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seasonal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of that his trainers wanted to know nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the launch of the season did not take place after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over to Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be dis@@ car@@ ded pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an un@@ weather . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann said that players from Au@@ e might even be a little fr@@ ischer , since they would have no har@@ dest and complete game like Fortuna against a flour@@ ishing spl@@ itter in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know so 100 % , where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while guests from the Rhin@@ eland were rather a favorite favor@@ it on Sunday to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need it away , just because we have the claim to get under the first Six@@ s , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is very positive in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga you must hit by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and over@@ clo@@ cking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um assessment tests released
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of tested persons older than 18 years are older , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Soviet t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ en@@ et ) has started conducting tests last year .
they are supposed to make the assessment of the age more accurately during the asylum process after the Swedish mig@@ rat@@ ory authority ( migrants ) were critic@@ ised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees .
to date , migration short@@ ened 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test@@ ify cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has evaluated so that the person may be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are resistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see big difference in statistics of past months , numbers are fairly constant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has suffered over his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 44@@ 2 cases to suggest that the sear@@ ched person 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ blast the 5@@ 81 has analysed the results that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical treatment assessment , in x @-@ rays of We@@ ish@@ ly @-@ teeth and MR@@ T @-@ recordings of knee @-@ teeth , which are then analyzed by dental clinics and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ized in some areas .
an skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work encomp@@ asses the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later as usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t believe the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
if we can not say it , we should not do that as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of testing : &quot; in general , they can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is not correct .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday there was a seven tons of heavy bet@@ we@@ dge installed at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold loan , construction manager at the department of street and traffic in the government of government of Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time in all three parts of the house between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Easy is for sure that the schedule will be respected .
the first bridge , from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads via the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
built it in the year 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly san@@ iti@@ zed .
the other two bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were er@@ ected in 1939 and are twelve , and 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge on the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called spectac@@ le board .
this is a ver@@ tic@@ ist , which is also used as a farm away .
on Friday part of the bridge the bridge should be used on Friday a 20 meter width .
it will then move the pedestrian road .
the particular thing is that it deals with production parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ vin@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the pat@@ ented rolls .
special finger@@ tips , that requires tracking of lines through the Bau@@ werk in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass label , which many firms are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of work by hand@@ kno@@ b on the project .
moreover , first fish and cr@@ abs had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building building and the con@@ gl@@ om@@ eration towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic of traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for the construction work at the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher entrance , the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof , &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the costs for the three Br@@ ück@@ ens@@ ations are 700 000 Euros .
the whole is funded by the country .
after@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest at German potato salad
it is not so frequent that parties are moving towards a rope , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to get under a hat .
the parties in the chal@@ k vul@@ tures ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peac@@ efully flag because the Af@@ D is presented in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster &apos;s &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which forms the chief duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the dep@@ uty president Beatri@@ x von Stor@@ k .
but those who are on @-@ site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the after@@ no@@ isse@@ urs , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The E@@ if@@ el remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; in the fountain is planned , but will now take place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ ak event in the Stadthalle .
a colour@@ ful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum One World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , really happy : &quot; great how many people come here together . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who contributed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have influenced many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ for@@ s come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes was reported by the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel , he ende@@ avo@@ red to deal with such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ n@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already established Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is doing it : against 8 pm at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse Red@@ ner , including the rh@@ et@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ ener that are waiting for the German Socialist candidate to be held for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty govern@@ or Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k to hold its speeches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
slightly more than an hour the Af@@ D event , guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is short notice after 9 pm .
the police can put off - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kon@@ zer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian Tromp@@ eter Miros@@ lav Pet@@ kov gives him a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; bal@@ kan@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classic German training with roots in music music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winner and winners of numerous international competitions and have op@@ positions in European cutting @-@ edge technology .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at both the same as in a new thread , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the player &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; mix pop , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written it independent for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with her special acoustic , becomes consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her Bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of her life .
but I would like to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very open about her om@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I put into che@@ ered cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as a neighbour ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relation of the artist &apos;s wood stars was the one of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ aya which ultimately fell hard to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all that as@@ sures the bre@@ eders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with any serious one I kept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten insi@@ sts that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so it was never confused or hin@@ der .
I never liked it not seriously to be taken seriously . &quot;
particularly amongst them , they have suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but at school time , when they prefer as a be@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girl .
this really has been hurt me .
when I was eleven , I told me the kids , I would look like a be@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and sham@@ eful .
well , I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to have their love life : &quot; people expect you to live in a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps some may call myself un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like it to justify to the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , Democrats have removed himself from me , &quot; said govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of words ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I &apos;m a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump said before a great announcement in the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate in Hill@@ ary Clinton .
justice , who is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes establishes that he has inher@@ ited coal mining in five states and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon shop .
it is worth $ 1,@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday , in which it said , &quot; The Party candidate of Gover@@ nor Justice , is another blow to a democratic party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ement and the control of the least legislative bodies in history the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is the last rejection of a party which is from above down to bottom , and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ Chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a Declaration of C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; honest &quot; Russian Ent@@ schul@@ digung for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
the worldwide chief of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised the Thursday , what he described as an aggressive exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeated , it was not the moment for the country to be taken back in sports .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ ar said during the IAAF @-@ Congress on the eve of Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport , and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he is sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at competitions Gold@@ - and Silber@@ med@@ a@@ illen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF @-@ Congress for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) evidence has been given to nation@@ ally funded d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ president Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that Russian Federation has recognised himself , that some quite hot times has experienced and everything is possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia won the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lets of the corrupt system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London following the strict IAAF @-@ criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IAAF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ union .
Dro@@ ope tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still working freely , he said Rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council .

for a fun@@ eral party in the nor@@ theastern Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two have thought of a helic@@ opter in Mali di@@ ge@@ income soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an even un@@ resolved subject matter , Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they recorded the two revenues but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ple@@ aded ourselves against this highest sacrifice which they provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday one week in the western African Mali .
their har@@ row were transferred to Germany and launched on Thursday by a still@@ birth of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ he Dom St. Peter .
at noon we first took only the relatives in the church leave .
after that , the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , of representatives from the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among these were the Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
dream on ro@@ ses laid down , the relatives were arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the Church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ he and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defence from the Ley@@ en signed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rated soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and inaugur@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ attered mann has been built in Frit@@ z@@ lar , who had been built in Frit@@ z@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ im@@ ents .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ lau@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur des Reg@@ iment , zu which the soldiers said , &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , it could not have missed . &quot;
doubts at the UN Mission in Mali the Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral party , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought to the cathedral .
when and where they are over@@ shad@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not get any data .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife

but he did not intend to put his intention in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the th@@ ap@@ on@@ ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he reti@@ res in the retirement and sets the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in a auto@@ biography of Hain@@ aut over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did .
my Danish was swe@@ eping , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ter instead of kn@@ itted , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I had to be instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand commer@@ ical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ash@@ amed of me .

Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swift compliance
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Nieder@@ sachsen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re@@ election of the country , but does not want to come back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before , the dis@@ closing of a Green MPs from their country @-@ driven parliamentary group had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Land@@ tag election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce One @-@ vote majority in the parliament on the opposition from the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens @-@ representative El@@ ke T@@ westen founded their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for choosing 2018 in their election circle at Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained them on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to absor@@ b them .
this means , the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had spent 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the ratio was around the other way round .
the new country day will be elected by the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government has now decide whether they could continue in this situation without any majority .
Stephan W@@ eil does not believe it is necessary for the day @-@ to @-@ cut its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state of affairs also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s day @-@ presi@@ dents shall withdraw the confidence and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these opportunities must be legally controlled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but a little k@@ uri@@ os . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it stands out as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the parliamentary assembly for the return of their country roads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she has received her home country , which has received it over the green country , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the Arab Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen exceptionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliber@@ ately decided not to guide any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the fac@@ tion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also against the background that there were no content differences , we cannot make this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the rem@@ n@@ ant of the Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as Ver@@ rat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only a Council of voters in Lower Saxony , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) , who quickly choose the country of Land@@ tag .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their promises , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their final van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration , their personal interests before the benefit of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U is involved in Lower Saxony in Lower Saxony and is trying to hit the political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U @-@ Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to encourage his members to absor@@ b El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , thre@@ w T@@ ent in front of fal@@ si@@ zing the result of the election election in 2013 .
at that time the CD@@ U was the SPD &apos;s strongest power , SPD and green had in Land@@ tag , but a hau@@ led majority of one vote .
agricultural ministers in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ sman , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agriculture ministers Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) stands in an interview with the Ed@@ itorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumers protect against po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumer to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ tob@@ og@@ gy .de , the federal states represent the most recent information on the various eggs @-@ char@@ ds .
suffer@@ ers should be destroyed or be returned .
also , if after all we are currently aware , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated .
now Al@@ di takes the best crisis action @-@ action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of enligh@@ ten@@ ers from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food @-@ surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has immediately swit@@ ched immediately , and since announ@@ cements of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has just as much as the manufacturers to concern that the sold @-@ out products are busi@@ est and health in@@ concei@@ vable .
if eggs are exceeded with 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ load eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies are to blame .
are factories and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the lack of knowledge , the manufacturing industry meets no immediate debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , they must count on account of illegal practices of services based on economic damages .
as always there is too little contro@@ vers@@ y in the ap@@ se .
is it only lacking in the personnel or on the jurisdiction ?
yet there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the truth also means that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consequ@@ ent explanation of such action and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ or in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be taken , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already repeatedly made clear that I am expecting a seam@@ less education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m near food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?

how the financial rules of football will affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ resolved issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that monitors the European game has power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair @-@ play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A in Life mean that PSG must point at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will be more than ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ve to France .
PSG can make sure money casual with certainty to bring N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him to galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy of the rich gl@@ acial family of Qatar .
associations should use a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to engage with legitimate entries to give them the break @-@ down point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that in their quest for success enormous debt had to be taken , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drawn their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P had to rely on the debt of the club to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that was used by Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P contrac@@ tion period , which runs until 2018 , you may accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor was Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in to continue to terri@@ fy from excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PSG paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , they can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year agreement , so that the dis@@ solution can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 44,@@ 4 million euros in the year @-@ leaving qualification .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has come together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PSG received a bill of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members are limited for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs that could try to av@@ ail her financial supervision by setting up their income through companies , which are associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ aly@@ tic company could sp@@ onder@@ s if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard mark@@ ings , the UEF@@ A does not apply this as legitim@@ ation income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was produced by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could be made by payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 , in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but PSG and Qatar have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM Ambassador will be made and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators simply could figure out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEF@@ A still offers more attentive , every attempt to deal with .
the UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PSG on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ed on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of over EUR 10 million in 2015 , a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the final financial year are still to be published .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ting sales .
the association considers that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s way@@ man by claim@@ ing that PSG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ar &apos;s latter &apos;s ownership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations of La Liga is divi@@ des against a State administ@@ ered by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to protect the financial Fair@@ play because one walks different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new film supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey Board chocolate has produced for the Swiss .
now the work of cooperation in front of a possible conclusion : the airline writes the mission to be new .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

approximately 17 million small red white sp@@ og@@ ging panels made up to 14 grams per year the flight @-@ companion in front of landing to passengers .
about the cost , Swiss does not want to make any information .
the sector &apos;s sector value the order volume in accordance with &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary has obtained an annual turnover of about one billion Swiss francs .
yet more important is always the advertising effect : for one sc@@ og@@ gi@@ ers it is a prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants gives it to the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y it .
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
according to the report report , Cho@@ col@@ at Frey plans to make a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss Chocolate manufacturer has not been att@@ ain@@ able for an opinion .

nost@@ algia &quot; goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repet@@ ition of history is at the same time nost@@ alg@@ ically because of the glorious days of the characters of 80 @-@ years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wers the sk@@ etch @-@ com@@ edy , &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time nearly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contains an original story for a speaking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by boo@@ sted them on the core of the G@@ ags - the middle age of children playing dirty children , which will grow - nevertheless they managed to win the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the building .
&quot; ten Years &apos; , with his adults , which are now adults , is less emoti@@ onally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the found@@ ness in principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand &quot; Ro@@ cks the Cr@@ adle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that saw the cradle . ) .
at one point a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things out of the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ oters ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mar@@ mal@@ ign@@ ant wh@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wers ) that is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , EX@@ K@@ UR@@ SE are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Singles &quot; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old st@@ acker .
it is the moments to fal@@ sely mad@@ ness that could make this fran@@ chise may be like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieved what I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years &apos; , whose last scene will show the Ban@@ de , how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Amazon is in a different kind of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ kampf @-@ I@@ KO@@ NO@@ GRA@@ PH@@ Y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka made com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , provides a Fo@@ und TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism Lenin@@ ism .
the main roll@@ ers - a hard @-@ tener Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alog@@ s by Chann@@ ing Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt to English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police spends the time playing chess on TV , how Americans prefer to do with football ) .
and the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the True propaganda of a mur@@ derer - a mur@@ derer that carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it is often playing a single one .
for six long episodes it moves , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which could be re@@ arranged on a lower length , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef could always visit the American message , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who eng@@ ul@@ led a bunch of ham@@ burger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communication is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a joint .
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian creator is not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police were a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning they were divided in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Konstan@@ z , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart in Stuttgart to pass numerous objects such as the prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 compl@@ aining about the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and already ar@@ rest warran@@ t against this .
in addition , the officials gave greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of hundreds .
during the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
in the event Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
total were more than 300 polic@@ emen in operation .
the members of the Maf@@ ia will have organised drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , ad@@ mitt@@ ent murder and rob@@ ber@@ ment .
since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance is established against organized drugs in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ or in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a representative exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in doing so , the investigations of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als with a view to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , during early in the morning , several shots were dropped into a restaurant , likely to go to the account of the Ban@@ de .
fil@@ ings large g@@ aps in the aliens @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who do not appear to appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report that the foreigners in Germany shows considerable defects in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lead to partly serious fail@@ ures in asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ s@@ ect for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen manner , has made aware of a media report based on large g@@ aps in the aliens register .
defects in the registration of the recorded data could lead to asylum @-@ procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; to partly serious fail@@ ures , &quot; warned this way in an analysis that predomin@@ ates the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; .
in the register the data is according to ten million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including approximately 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is thus managed by approximately 600 foreigners authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been kept sufficiently , the data quality in parts has not been good yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer should arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data @-@ ups can be much slow@@ down significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ gre@@ ed people are overwhel@@ med by EU citizens that would not need to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with ex@@ trav@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the German government has apparently started to return a refugee @-@ families with more than 16 years of children back to Italy when they are returned from there .
that is why I emerged from an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung reports . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that BA@@ MF perform such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except for inf@@ ants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper taking reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement it is responsible for refugees of the EU state to achieve them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country .
to substanti@@ ate , the Office now write : &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with low @-@ year children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave warranty for the admission and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EG@@ M@@ R ) consider these ple@@ d@@ ations for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would send refugees to the course of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal spokes@@ person in the Bundestag fac@@ tion in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &apos; families with children thre@@ aten because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system , un@@ law@@ ful conditions , and a haz@@ ard of cinema . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates with 0,25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the mit@@ igation of inflation led the spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; y@@ ields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they joined the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( MP@@ C ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for interest rates on 0,25 % , whereby in this month fewer users had a rise , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly assessment , the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and by 2018 , that pressure on household income would continue , while inflation in autumn is likely to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that in the next years Zin@@ del would be necessary to grow the inflation led by the Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit cost may increase more than expected at the financial markets .
the members agreed to return a part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ Konjunk@@ tur@@ pak@@ ets which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for funding to provide investment funds for banks , although it is expected that she is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds .
minutes following the decision on the interest rate stated the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the MP@@ C , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the realities of households continue to use the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain accus@@ ation of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets fores@@ ee the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pre@@ projected growth forecasts for the Bank for this and next year stand in comparison with the 1.9 % and 1,7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the Po@@ und dropped to this news compared to the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und decreased by 0.5 % to 31 US dollars and fell by 0,4 % to 1,@@ 5@@ Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth rates show the increasing expectations of a height @-@ height and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0,2 % in the previous three months at 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report provided little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and reduced conditions , since the tigh@@ tening first will get worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy will not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent monetary policy in the next few years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but they added that wages to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy will also be strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributed to the weak pound of which a part of lower consumption taxes is compens@@ ated .
the decision come a year after lo@@ wering the interest rates on 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which s@@ laugh@@ ed the sin@@ ks of the P@@ act .
the Bank is estimated that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the last ruling of the bank on interest rates , the reputation increased according to a high @-@ height , since inflation postpon@@ ed the pressure on hard displ@@ aced households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded up a rise of 0.5 % .
inflation is reduced from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will be back in the coming months .
the Bank said the crossing in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; completely &quot; to write &quot; the weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent decline in the s@@ wap body , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the credit card is sil@@ ently looking for shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and close the new mort@@ gage , and many with toll @-@ free options and low sm@@ ates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health service ) is to be controversial HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people
patients will be obtained from September to a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS access to a &quot; trans@@ itional &quot; HIV prevention . &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that prior to intercourse , pre@@ ex@@ position proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) that can reduce the inf@@ ec@@ tions@@ risk of some 86 percent , now , from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he explained to finance the process after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice had confirmed that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess player announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chef Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones who will allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced to all England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission to infection risk .
pre@@ p to take before intercourse means that just enough medication exist in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or as early as two hours before the intercourse .
to those who come for treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that have not been successfully treated .
in clinics the participants will identify appropriate participants , including the study , including men , women , transfers and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a specialist doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the programme is signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England propos@@ ing a contract for the delivery of the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by accum@@ ulated by clinical rewards as it is specifically targeted , recorded and implemented in large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this large new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to complement HIV and over@@ take excessive demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a defining moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted to vulnerable and endangered people , the possibility to alter the English HIV epide@@ mic .
September , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really checked and not subject to treatment with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to lie that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has taken a risk for HIV .
now because the pre@@ p test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health of Ministry , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after months @-@ to @-@ long delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence show how transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this viable infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected HIV , and that it is contributing to achieving the circulation of HIV in society a step closer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former Ban@@ ker@@ in with a passion for real estate , resulting in 2014 from a big house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not un@@ packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger area , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sear@@ ched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and had the same high ceil@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a s@@ laugh@@ ing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal cover height .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceil@@ ings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two spaces in one another , so that the architectural challenge consisted in keeping a mezzanine which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think to solve the task .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms that they were rus@@ hed to each other without need@@ ing to decor@@ ate ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that he had the right amount for the function above or down . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place a fan , two spaces in full height - with much extra drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of retreat from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ or@@ ous living area .
spec@@ kl@@ ed Gold@@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Serge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of spi@@ res plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light .
on both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to let him work longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer units for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ y space the beauty of the living room can tap the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a gar@@ den@@ um .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains the fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , terrible MD@@ F @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so important that it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the base size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials which make the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not forget you in the electric plu@@ gs in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ ric number by slightly moderate in something quite admir@@ able .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave these not .
brothers fight for an extra of 500 million US dollars
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation because of one of the biggest property imperative that worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer of Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and its business shall be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , brothers thre@@ w 38 property worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family has bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there founded the family of West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her depart@@ ed father Col@@ in - was described by Paul as &apos; main operator , and the dominant personality &apos; in the family De Lut@@ is - about two thirds of the company &apos;s fortune and Paul approximately one third .
any juris@@ dictions that this means that Col@@ in is owned by 316 million dollars and Paul worth € 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; those proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left it with that which I kept for the best objects in 2015 , he wrote in 2015 in a first affair .
last Friday after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims he excluded him .
Col@@ in argu@@ ed , this is not true , it thro@@ ws Paul before , some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to commit the argument .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage is writing that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher partner and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides by law firms .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her de@@ ceased husband were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy shops in the late 1950 @-@ er years and in the early se@@ venti@@ es bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , opened in Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began studying West@@ co , when he was the high school in my last years , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is said that her and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property to pass on to her sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers to court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark at the aband@@ on@@ ment of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars were paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has changed very back , although he was a former AF@@ L executive board , and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answering by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad to say that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and drag our sur@@ name to the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not win that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he will still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote Col@@ in .
iner@@ aries of new staff is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the head on a more excessive course .
here is a piece of re@@ por@@ ters Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , at his first working day with leit@@ ner employee , he gathered a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps in the house he has repaired . poor information that fall into the hands of the President .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly tells the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to count Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ ump@@ y relationship to TV extends decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; if can@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was angry because of an im@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of places he was convinced , &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ or Sam Nun@@ berg in February .
Polit@@ icos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep a m@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to make sure its personal media rate includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that stret@@ chers Twitter @-@ custom ever &quot; under control &quot; was , is ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this campaign hi@@ kers know something that we do not know others - that ge@@ ars twe@@ ets without their interventions had not included more ign@@ ition .
we will never get to know something about the twe@@ ets which is not sent .
if his staff made it many times to keep away from him , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump Cont@@ ro@@ ses .
part of the problem is that people in a white house , which is composed of competing parties , always try to introduce their own agenda by presenting their own agenda , which encourages its views from the world .
Polit@@ ico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons and to bring about dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example , which was described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that they can react like a volcano on negative media changes , especially those with sham@@ eful Lec@@ ks , and that he keeps finding out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what happened in the end of February , when someone received the President b@@ ös@@ d a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty @-@ dep@@ uty rowing in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a p@@ ile to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson said because of ch@@ ic@@ ans permanently out of Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ makers added that the dam , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it folded ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ si@@ ves self , and his advis@@ ers still seek influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .

travellers to negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ ess series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on war@@ fare that have negotiated one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to reg@@ ain a field in front of their sovereig@@ ns .
the travellers have paved their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ ess series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they were only being de@@ vised by a Council of excav@@ ated gr@@ aben , in order to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ kl@@ ed group found a gap in the defense units and de@@ ed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous people said , &quot; They are pulled back to the evening after she sent on Bentley He@@ ath where they have made stones on the pas@@ sers .
the Council must act in fact forced to implement it when dealing with the problem was useless .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect its parks .
I &apos;m living on the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my par@@ ade@@ my if the Council can not even stop it . &quot;
a community that did not want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of this travel@@ er just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers also have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
an Spre@@ cher@@ in the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and working with the police of Soli@@ mb@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so they can proceed as soon as possible .
to support our evidence @-@ collection , it is very important that as many locals become an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling them 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create an image of the situation where the Court should consider when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof through the dam@@ aging atmosphere of the company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , around 30 000 stays per year were lost and also income through the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in the light of the rising figures of refugees that occurred in the county , the hotel building is offered to be used as a collective accommodation available for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by placing an extension plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time .
but primarily Fre@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ may@@ bach Julian Os@@ s@@ wald has defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interest in the house at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with business manager Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer was acquired with a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin with a voluntary au@@ ction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ b .
you are hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been in front of the entrance since a longer period of construction , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation works are done .
the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , blan@@ kets as part was built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , there will be new windows installed .
everything was later &quot; nice &quot; close &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to penet@@ rate a jewelry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one should not position themselves at the high level of the hotel in lu@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown @-@ level , empha@@ sized Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise starts up wide at its approximately 60 rooms , explains the Gois@@ erer .
both individual holiday makers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
following the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine precisely .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
also , the outdoor turbines are brought down to Vorder@@ mann , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ Wed@@ ler uses Grand Jury
in the Russia affair for US President Donald Tr@@ ump is intended to submit a so @-@ called Grand Jury in the Russian affair .
in the past weeks we recorded the work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote to appeal with the cause of confidential people .
the newspaper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified .
the CN@@ N radio station has already reported the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between tr@@ umps &apos;s son and Russian lawyer .
us sec@@ rec@@ y accused the Krem@@ lin for longer , deliber@@ ately inter@@ fer@@ ed in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
seek study , if there were ab@@ outs between tr@@ umps electoral campaigns and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main focus of the investigation should be several men who acted in the election campaign as advis@@ er to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps priv@@ ates and business environment among the Lup@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in person to the centre and look for the accus@@ ation if the president is hin@@ dering the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible mis@@ conception and decide whether an indic@@ t@@ ment shall be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys therefore also called al@@ amm@@ ers .
mostly , they are swit@@ ched on when it comes to larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the body also can be swit@@ ched by the prosec@@ ut@@ or to add people to the hearing below E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N radio station , lectures have already been exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who were participating in the meeting had been invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
beside Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also tr@@ umps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ son Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging electoral campaign by Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that show how they don &apos;t want to sit in his work and that he should be needed if it should be necessary to act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the collection of an indic@@ t@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the installation of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums started at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , President on Thursday evening uses a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign against its political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a way of feeling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well because they don &apos;t have anything else about whom they can talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b said in an opinion , he wis@@ s nothing from the submission of a Grand Jury .
but they also work in the secret , he said .
the White House fears all measures which acceler@@ ated the work of the special event in a fair way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey said three times that is not established against the president .
one has no reason to suppose that something has changed since it was in the explanation .
yet , it was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had spot@@ ted .
because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations have turned out loud , and did not want to hin@@ der the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , wearing it for an attitude of investigations against the then national security consultant , Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
according to the representation of US media , the White House material raised against the Sonder@@ er@@ als and its employees .
the sol@@ dered spec@@ ulation about it , whether drinking Mu@@ eller released .
unlike an independent Special Off@@ er of Congress as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair of the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has consolidated a position in which it theoretically could be attributed to the President of the President of Justice ruled by the Minister of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to take such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators put forward leg@@ is@@ ations on Thursday , after which the special release could no longer be released .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is driving in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the cliff is solved by the short @-@ fold size of Berlin of Schel@@ isha .
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut für Polar@@ - und Marine research on Wednesday with .
the tr@@ illion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large KO@@ LO@@ SS t@@ rei@@ be now to the north and will probably take two , three years until he was mel@@ ted .
it is with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice gig@@ gles , the researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
whether climate change has played a part in the break@@ down of the ic@@ eberg , is subject to researchers .
in total , it has been a series of un@@ common break@@ down@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be combined with the heating of heating .
the KO@@ LO@@ SS was now a part of the lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ ser@@ mon until now .
Shel@@ em@@ n swi@@ ms at the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ celebrated is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this re@@ ar@@ ship was the balance of w@@ ax@@ es and ab@@ rup@@ ting some years ago .
a complete Schel@@ celebrated was there and writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ rec@@ ess is in danger , because the advanced edge has never moved as far as at present .
also , the ic@@ um@@ ing is under tension and could be dis@@ car@@ ded if at a key@@ point , a piece pic@@ ks .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ sol@@ em@@ n and ic@@ eberg increases the sea level , not as they swim in the water and pushed ice as much water as it gives after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the sh@@ re@@ ar@@ ship leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly raise the level , but only in the low degree , writes the British research project to observe the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ celebrated is according to A@@ WI @-@ Information with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth @-@ largest stal@@ em@@ n of the Antarc@@ tica .
on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice tag is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wid@@ est withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmed he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ celebrated now will grow again and possibly mer@@ all , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models said that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers do not withdraw the ab@@ st@@ ine of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the past few decades , quite a lot of ice @-@ mol@@ ding of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
this long finish of the Antarc@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
according to data from the British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula since the 19@@ 50s has declined to 28 000 square kilometers .
this decrease in the temperature increase in the temperature increase .
the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has grown by around three degrees over the past 50 years and thus in the areas where the temperature is fastest growing at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants clo@@ ist@@ rate if you need personnel
because it &apos;s getting more difficult , filling free spots , the CD@@ U asks the CD@@ U , out of the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Krei@@ dler 41 new bodies in the administration has been through .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 appr@@ enti@@ ces have their first working day behind him .
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 App@@ lic@@ ants were to finish the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is lacking further staff to manage the growing demands and tasks .
currently there is the circle M@@ ett@@ mann still 50 not occupied places .
among other things doctors and engineers are searching for the general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to seize the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and the U@@ WG initiative to seize the initiative and ent@@ ail the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out as a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wish of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for professionals , but future @-@ oriented of the application scar@@ city , it is called .
the overall concept should come to the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ lear@@ ners and include an apprentic@@ eship exhau@@ st for both CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has it with Personal problems that you had not known earlier .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it comes to a high number of employees , the disease , or age @-@ related works from the service .
thus the highest time for action so do not remain un@@ owned .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , with his party , goes beyond the common motion .
he was already having a cra@@ p day for a f@@ ist surprise when he caused the Pers@@ onn@@ et to be publicly question@@ ed and the rest of the parties ent@@ ailed .
people want to be ver@@ ified that all the options are ver@@ ified that allow a outlet from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we come here not short notice to a satisfying solution , the group should seek the trade union with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circular cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is trying to pay the CD@@ U , employees and officials to pay better than the collective work for the public sector actually fores@@ een .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , where employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ Council Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy tigh@@ tened up the sound to the NGO migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs , war@@ n the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue to continue , if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can proceed , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i said in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La st@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ nit@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities had a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth ration@@ ale &apos; conf@@ isc@@ ated because their crew had worked effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has only been operating for a year since a year , it was bor@@ rowed from , to express itself in a detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian territory of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat from &apos; youth ration@@ ale &apos; that supervis@@ es the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that his occupation rested infl@@ atable migrants that can be delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can switch to it , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was alle@@ ge@@ dly found only 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content is published by the Italian media .
the occupation will suspected of the authority of the Italian coast guard , the bail@@ out courses in the zone out of humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the Code of Con@@ duct you must have boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , above all an Italian police officer on board their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep up the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessary , but acceptable , since they were not entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their bail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants that got back to the bail@@ out measures in Italy , have declined shar@@ ply in recent weeks , indic@@ ating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and co @-@ operation with local civil liberties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further discussions with Libyan citi@@ zenship in this month , about economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali as measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ as
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days long tri@@ als and sights .
there@@ for were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ enh@@ ei@@ mer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est by Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly in towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the prev@@ ailed planes .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga grad@@ up for E @-@ Sport
are the sport @-@ stars in future face computer con@@ soles , instead of struggling with wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious sector , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative shop - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ceil@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also has recognised the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ eine , who are increasingly interested in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning , 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport section in mid July and two professionals for the computer @-@ play FIFA 17 under the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire the brand new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Management of Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on this train still some slow@@ ing down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the next weekend the football World association FIFA in London is organizing the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which the g@@ amer of different clubs can compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beside Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , e.g. Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified .
even Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must deal particularly with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ old , that young people continue to go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer .
with celebr@@ ity e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be present online by far more often than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia once a year .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the E @-@ Sport will be played as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football Sim@@ ulation FIFA on a competitive level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports also , Li@@ gen established , in which the pros can compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is this a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly ordinary .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ir has long been faced with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is profession@@ ally and a lot of biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classical sports - for example elevated heart frequencies , st@@ ress@@ ings , hor@@ monal changes .
furthermore , it has cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response capacity .
professional g@@ amer should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are hard to run in online play , and in the scene the structures of classical Sports .
the scientists highlights the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the way internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural im@@ pedi@@ ments .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Under@@ entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments .
sales should be at 130 million in three years .
against the barely 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga it is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international are many countries already further .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rod@@ rigu@@ ez take part in the US team of N@@ RG es@@ ports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher invested in the e@@ Sport @-@ Cont@@ ests of Uni@@ cryp@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in Europe is doing a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport as classes were introduced , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Ver@@ a according to Dut@@ y are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared V@@ f@@ B Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nost@@ algia , and the old days are no longer sufficient .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company simultaneously align the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are living in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can not keep in keeping it all the way it was always like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad is pushing for su@@ icide , do@@ omed to su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her judgment after Git@@ tern and five years were exposed to Be@@ währ@@ ung .
Carter was condemned by Con@@ rad Roy in June because of the per@@ missible killing of Con@@ rad , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ com@@ for@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to the appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum of 20 years ago , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy were interested in a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red p@@ ants and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with the out@@ dated hands and down@@ lighted eyes , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have launched a Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ ist at the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
it has no responsibility whatsoever , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no rep@@ ent@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters Law said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance they fully regret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even their human@@ ism have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is &quot; no day in which I ro@@ ve &apos;t de@@ pl@@ ess the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am going with everything I am trying , in spite of all my p@@ ains that we will carry for eternity with us for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they will never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to place a right@@ ful preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit a different su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters &apos;s texts revealed that they encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hän@@ g dich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging out of a building that I know yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; All you have to do is the generator turn off and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy sear@@ ched and ord@@ ained that she will benefit through some press from that case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
to the few , the Carter defended , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before being released two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup tournament winner of a great season - Extra motivation ser@@ ch da not .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked like Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but there was far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ m and not a Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself dis@@ closed Bin@@ de , on his arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria captain .
good , the one could have been better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was able to interpret K@@ imm@@ i as well .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in the youth of youth , Deb@@ üt@@ ant and just from the holiday of the existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he .
sugar@@ s are also bor@@ dered at the de@@ ar@@ est ones to those who wants to keep a lot of blood @-@ neutral , which one wants to keep in humor .
who@@ ever was keen to en@@ roll the legacy of Lah@@ m can only need a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday night the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
on the right back , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did her evil .
and at all , k@@ imm@@ i in this start @-@ formation like the one who can take the hel@@ per also best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played troops .
he had the view to the whole while many others were busy themselves .
Vid@@ al therefore , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ dable scar@@ f ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus to get out to the devil kom@@ m to the achievements of Asia @-@ Travel ( fol@@ d@@ ded only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot is not neg@@ lect .
this still works quite well .
Sü@@ le ran next to K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both ag@@ med sou@@ ver@@ ine .
the well @-@ called Napoli @-@ storm was often difficult , moreover , ad@@ mired even in the game building a few times successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y was that the result was not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; toys , template : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ ites this Bavaria world still lives for the re @-@ accessible , one looked at the game .
Rud@@ y for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i said after some cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase , &quot; what is going here , I have already noticed .
with Bavaria you simply need to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to bring the new ones no more .

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Ministers : business lo@@ bt W@@ iss@@ ing Tempo
it often turned out to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relation between the country and the regional economy , as Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor the Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year , in which the new econom@@ ist is Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) in office .
chambers and companies from the region address T V request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer GmbH ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing takes up the desires of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocks . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al sees N@@ atus in the infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now up in the country &apos;s pri@@ or@@ iti@@ es@@ list .
even this year the Ministry meets a plan procedure for up to 2021 the building is supposed to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West In@@ um@@ ing Trier , which stands in an urgent need for the country &apos;s agenda .
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minist@@ eri@@ ter@@ spre@@ cher@@ in Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
N@@ atus is looking for a sign@@ post to regional , but international competitive companies .
the industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier seeks to increase the wine @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to boost the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports for ten years .
moreover , W@@ iss@@ ing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company lo@@ bt the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young traine@@ es , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided is a premium volume of 1000 Euro for the most effective champion@@ ships and 2500 euros , if gradu@@ ates are self @-@ reli@@ ance within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
during the planned street building , fast facts can be made , at the same time lacking in the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , who wants to stop W@@ iss@@ ing at the regional operation , have so far been occupied by 29 positions .
the I@@ HK calls for more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U Leader Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting station , the country invest@@ s 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of inland water@@ ways .
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
harvest@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band construction in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,4 .

Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day prior to the announcement of Audi told BMW that would offer it to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW leader said the company is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving constraints , &quot; and therefore moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW ads is able to offer or limit the motor vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to modify its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the activities as recall .
European autom@@ akers have supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen O@@ xi@@ des , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the aircraft emissions from diesel to install , also take to what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indic@@ ted to pamp@@ er the powerful car companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ grade devices , emissions regul@@ ating to comply with the rules if a car has been tested , but instead of normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former manager of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be put to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities have accused Audi to deal with the emissions rules in Europe and a request that focused on the United States , has been extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the study could be heavy stra@@ ined : the luxury @-@ car manufacturers is directly proportional to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has taken the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors will also join , on the mor@@ nings Saturday a raft by Munich , which has a special message .
whom it moves on Saturday again to Is@@ ar , who will see a great raft there between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common float , with Is@@ ar tourist .
but the building reference is to be clar@@ ified .
on the raft , one sees a big Inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a gar@@ bage .
the pre@@ l@@ ude to a public @-@ resolution campaign , to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love &quot; ... is the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective bow flow .
in the last summer , the raft over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a rec@@ kl@@ ess and eco @-@ conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter of suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was time of one of the best published Car@@ to@@ on dra@@ ftsmen , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are its hall@@ mark .
also with 85 the Argentin@@ ian is still standing and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested among other things as an artist for happiness , making it frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his Car@@ to@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China he found Mor@@ dil@@ lo many fans .
again and again the artist of Cities inspire you .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ dil@@ lo characters t@@ umm@@ eln in drawings with the sh@@ ed@@ ding tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting in character according to the drawing , works almost ten hours daily .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks find his d@@ roll figures continue to be much spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thousand @-@ feet as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D @-@ film , the 2019 is to enter the chin .
&quot; I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why it is therefore more foc@@ uss@@ ed on the TV series , which is produced as its original marks , what &apos;s going on .
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is rec@@ alled because of the lack of d@@ rought , and due to disease transfer@@ ing insects , leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian institution CRI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small zoo , a micro @-@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ thread , and in very dry weather there are a lot of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ ot not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also highly sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than to have very long crop @-@ drilling with a large number of flowers we have smaller , g@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ KEL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered , a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of the dar@@ ker from the ground , but also the wor@@ g@@ low of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of sorts , which are more resi@@ li@@ ent to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the L@@ ür@@ itz R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates his 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
on this Saturday and Sunday , F@@ esth@@ öh@@ ep@@ point is on this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval date .

ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist empha@@ sizes the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet elsewhere to check their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what are safer : you should take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gran@@ ites , or they leave them at home .
security experts have written three words to a plate on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
you ask the Rep@@ orter , to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and ab@@ dom@@ inal things .
there are drugs she@@ ers , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are dil@@ uted to stand on the hearing list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no fame of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ens accum@@ ulate , are more and more journalists at least 25 , since president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 has ended its office . 5@@ 89 are standing after attacks and threats , and so far , there were at least seven ab@@ ote in seven countries this year .
among the latter there is their publishers and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its absence will be felt deep , although its presence anywhere is present - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the front@@ age of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who showed his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was established a Son@@ ya &apos;s office in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the committee has led to the protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders who are connected every year with drug dealers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely put before judgment .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist that the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ com@@ for@@ ting and although the terrain is now even betra@@ yed .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very fool@@ ish to wast@@ ing my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why we know why we are all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez abandoned the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he made it just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was hal@@ ted by two men . he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot at it , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with &quot; twelve .
the ar@@ cher was driving in his car and damaged it close by .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to be free to fly in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ clam@@ ation last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since ri@@ val groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of se@@ perate , two @-@ story ho@@ een for drug ro@@ unders which are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of calm , if only a box has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bu@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the debt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ alled cart@@ el fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to time @-@ ti@@ pping trailers .
the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had so long survived that his friends and colleagues were approaching that he would always be there .
he was working as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter the anti@@ d@@ ote issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ er@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in time the newspaper also earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took over .
re@@ porter would like to publish hard @-@ hearing tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication , in which they could read stories , who asked anyone else to deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; award for its coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs , where ever they were leading .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a lifestyle , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October .
&quot; you need to take on the task which falls you as journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many still@@ birth ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team is missing Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ der bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and Rat@@ gues , a teacher , who knew how to survived .
you trusted in its routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go there and always sit at the same table there .
well ask them : was his love for routine his rub@@ bing ?
his death has also forced them to question their own assump@@ tions on how to carry out their work best and to stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their native Start@@ - and run@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ er@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ zens@@ ur and self @-@ preservation .
his own inst@@ in@@ cts trust .
if there was wrong , stay away from it .
the hass@@ le is , said the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling rou@@ gh@@ s , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly we were not allowed any cell phones . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking before the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ class quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked if these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen , the govern@@ or itself was not trusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the Ber@@ gl@@ and@@ ri , where the drug deals are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has moved to three main layers .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exp@@ é for the government spending , concentrated on the govern@@ or of the govern@@ or .
and there was a group that appeared in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or .
there was no official word about who has been kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so that it was time to write as it was time to write , what everyone in the city know : that the restaurant is a favorite locally produced by drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a politician , which ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost all the century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ kar@@ st cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real beg@@ ged the re@@ por@@ ters to write over prec@@ eding inci@@ dents in this e@@ at@@ ine , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man dropped a military attack .
only a few months ago , readers would have looked at the Colom@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body literature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of the communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been devoted to storage space for signs and stick@@ ers that are devoted to the murder of journalists , because the staff have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ viewer Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez Schn@@ app@@ ed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days , after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is of his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country journalists have become stronger by writing in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on hearing and construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day , the director shall be Bu@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the fall of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , a day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez accused the authorities , journalists , journalists and release them , because they told the truth .
it has since then asked that she was once again divided by the government because she is concerned that their fur@@ y has been viol@@ ated their obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved in the governmental and equal society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his final book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on command of politicians and security guards with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has performed more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you , because they would like you sne@@ aky the mouth , &quot; said r@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern boundary of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their body was found along with a note that alle@@ ge@@ dly signed by the Z@@ eta @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some of the stores have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dents Miros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue how it did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo to the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with a editorial view on the title page . what do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homes or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the roads and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are j@@ agt as it seems to be mur@@ dered by the photographer Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight out of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be poet , gives up that the drug dealers start@@ les it scar@@ es .
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
in order to be midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce went on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when upon once all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to sum@@ med up .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ breaks and safety r@@ ots close to the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the border @-@ edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the Tit@@ le page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens to be found close to - a further sho@@ ot@@ ings in the area .
Boy@@ or@@ qu@@ ez put a look at the polic@@ emen , who kept guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid of all they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a followed the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , followed its foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day she was mur@@ dered , the traine@@ ant@@ ee asked me to send it to the coverage of the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ak its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ estones of a can@@ adi@@ c mountain labor@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa , the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even notice that his glo@@ ve skin was from red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unpleasant past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awarded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered species of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k @-@ time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preser@@ v@@ ated condition has researchers who make it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; describe , bl@@ oss@@ ed
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was out of the surrounding cliffs of feh@@ l am Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more accurately .
the Fos@@ sil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy stra@@ ins .
after all these hard work the finished product is now ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; if you just blin@@ zeln a little with the eyes you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , researcher at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the cre@@ ature can be seen .
&quot; it will come into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found out that this crop is covered , although he is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat and ha@@ de din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sky@@ line that is known as a counter@@ tenor , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have enabled to mix better in his surroundings and to so@@ ak its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta @-@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours it has been careful .
the amazing preservation of specim@@ en offered it to Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , pattern and form of shed and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ shad@@ ed , a widespread Defense method in the animal , which means the tip of the cre@@ ature dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the counter is common , the results are surprisingly , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs by enough pressure by meat @-@ res din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals , using the counter @-@ shad@@ ed - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or trav@@ eller - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong beast @-@ behavior on a massive , strongly d@@ red din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organised connections in their sc@@ ales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red@@ dish brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on cl@@ ues about his life , including his preser@@ v@@ ated Dar@@ min@@ ate to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs when he died , went out into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe he is at sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k @-@ time was a time when giant Ther@@ mal @-@ periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of his terrible ancest@@ or .
this belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ ank after death in the sea and was ver@@ ified in mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hi@@ ps .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
it contains two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red her@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was cur@@ ved by the Western Canada until a flood@@ ed river was flood@@ ed into the open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ rs has preserved its arm@@ aments in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specim@@ en are so good that the door @-@ most still hol@@ low arm@@ rests along the din@@ osau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lot@@ to .
the more I accum@@ ulate , the conf@@ use it becomes .
Pet@@ ri@@ fied resi@@ dences of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank @-@ plates that carry the skull of the beast .
his real fore@@ foot lies on his side , his five fingers are up@@ wards .
I can count the sho@@ oters on his sole .
in the storm : Mass@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ last
severe accident on Thursday nights at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a Mass@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous ar@@ ches , long shelf life - and aff@@ lic@@ ers .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday morning there was about 20 people wo@@ unded .
according to the first information of the police were at 5 : 00 between the Conn@@ y@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm under 30 vehicles , including lor@@ ry , altern@@ ate .
about the exact number of publishers at first , there was initially no information .
it is easy to moderate injury , a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher said .
a great specim@@ en of lif@@ ebo@@ at was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the town of München , there formed a approximately ten kilometres long back@@ rest .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also came on the opposite side to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ters dis@@ counted the characteristic of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle that has now to be calculated with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 , then a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a passenger .
a Res@@ cue @-@ helic@@ opter was on the road to the accident .
German rail@@ ways : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing can be seen on the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
does the Schaff@@ ner and arous@@ ed a impro@@ per or irrit@@ ating the b@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
tickets @-@ Card .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over soon .
Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently the creators of Card .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and therefore used the ticket .
currently , a test run on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is expected to be available on many other remote traffic routes in Germany at the start of next year , &quot; said a railway speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train de@@ valu@@ ation with no work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to have bought it via the app of the railway , the DB navig@@ ator , which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket receipt .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you rise in the train , calling his ticket from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test results will then be a button on the electronic correspon@@ dent .
the trains accompanied on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
comes the pull @-@ companion in the ticket office in place Y he knows that there is a passenger with previously un@@ registered online ticket .
so you can continue to keep on , keep on silence .
the check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which should be used for the passengers .
&quot; who wants to go relaxed without ticket control by our train staff , checked out in the DB navig@@ ator simply .
this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing @-@ board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives , knows that in addition to delays and missed the ticket roll@@ ers are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
for often you yourself , in any case , but one of the participants do not find all the documents that you need to de@@ valu@@ ate online tickets .
either the credit card or the registration pass or otherwise a document you have to proceed .
the consequence are endless discussion between Zug@@ vor@@ s and Fahr@@ g@@ ast , which leads to poor mood in the section or big room and delays in the control of your own ticket and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service only .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same track are not activated .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to their core .
just one day after she had arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone .
they stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one had posted the information on her Fe@@ ed , closed her Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ shake @ the@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly referred to as Tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
the Rap@@ per from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed to twe@@ et live .
he post@@ ete a picture of map@@ le &apos;s cro@@ wned body , which was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is yes wild , &quot; I thought of himself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to twe@@ et later in the evening to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cri@@ bes , and by a man who said Bro@@ ck &apos;s father , who carried a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live @-@ feeling , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a bell@@ um dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , un@@ mistak@@ able another polic@@ eman , his ri@@ f@@ le , and cri@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recall he@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we got used to us and which we can call it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , of love and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers .
as Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , carried to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , bes@@ ought the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning , over the black experience and the black condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you remember how I have taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember they remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take it , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and it must be and raised in it .
she needs to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do is free to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience where she has not experienced any e@@ kl@@ ed racism , it is no different than the next black female child .
I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first stop when it arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority , which was moved to a Camp@@ site as the activ@@ ist to the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there appeared in Fer@@ rell and her daughter with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m changed after the 9th of August , &quot; said and not@@ ing that she was elected as a student at the University of Miss@@ ouri Saint Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience at the Organ@@ izing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted only to document &quot; what happened .
a question came to his sense . &quot; do you want to document , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and its resistance .
as follow up recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who are born and grew up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , have not centered on their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ in@@ mates .
his involvement brought his project closer together , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Bro@@ ck &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , because in this way I will be presented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that the movement is not related to a Messi@@ ah &apos;s guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the revealed participant in the film .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls Life as she loves to love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and the human being of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeated history the role of black w@@ ls women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the Black Teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leaders have carried a whole overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women need to carry the main last of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an un@@ anim@@ ously to remark that &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
it consists however , that &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ sive type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film by Fer@@ rell .
&quot; she was the person who spr@@ inkl@@ ed this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the front front , because with a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel her energy from the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news items in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long ago disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
fer@@ rell is at a demonstration for 2 ½ years because of the lo@@ wering of a highway with a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area they called her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless they cl@@ oned to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size @-@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , though they are not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall in the south @-@ east of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation in 2009 the population was made in ap@@ wor@@ e and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; needs no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi river ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size ling ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates develop that a gallery draws more customers into the city , the remaining shops will benefit , fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone ble@@ eding .
in addition , the gallery will be carefully planned on the ground on which the farm market hall is on the 13 direct market to its products .
with the start of construction work will be the end .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is a need for Bed@@ a to be sitting outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying a week for many years almost weekly at the farm hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always welcome very much .
even the but@@ cher we have discovered for us too .
we would like to hear that during and above all after building the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether the direct market will be marketed in a market hall in the gallery , comes at the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should probably not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the trol@@ ley @-@ branches in Bit@@ burg ?
whether garments , shoes , Dro@@ geri@@ - or supermarkets : I find it su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
that is already enough in our city .
one can see how many counter @-@ shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered is fresh , is offered largely directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ pure cost @-@ effective .
as you can see , cargo shop in a shopping center will be reserved only by larger companies because the local h@@ iring are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops there is almost no more and what it is still remains , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
mainly : where is the market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even when the bit @-@ gallery will eventually come .
or does it already create the g@@ hosts bit @-@ gallery previously , to exp@@ el all businesses from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this is simply not working .
and a shopping center , that is empty , also needs no one .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of that gallery .
but for a peasant @-@ hall , it is thanks to the desert @-@ fair many - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the peasant @-@ hall is for@@ ged , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ strange - hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the cuts out of the prison fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ zes was a 35 @-@ year sentence , after she made a secret diplomatic report on the site Wiki@@ Le@@ aks publicly .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd was called A Bec@@ ause of blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline united their professional competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and bla@@ zing dis@@ ruption , whose condem@@ nation of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorithms of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted by Mann@@ ing and may look out of the 30 portraits , a sharp even if something intellectual comment could not only be attributed to the mou@@ se@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ at@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly talked about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations against the es@@ pi@@ on@@ eg@@ es@@ etz , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison its picture was supp@@ ressed so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white self @-@ Self@@ ie , sitting in the Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde has been associated with which it was associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just off the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
in it , the artist &apos;s portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ens@@ ory arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ar g@@ um and g@@ um g@@ um , by extrac@@ ted the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a magazine P@@ azin .
&quot; they did an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she was not able to visit this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they made contact with Chelsea , and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and their incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were inter@@ change@@ able to un@@ equal bri@@ eff@@ ected over the course of two years .
they even created a &quot; Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied &quot; Supp@@ lied &quot; , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which the president would trans@@ g@@ ish Chel@@ ating judgment and it would be capable of seeing the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days , after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years would demand in a military attack in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy con@@ jun@@ cture .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able routes , which he should actually fix , continue to fl@@ ames .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen in a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its family name , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basic gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ es of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoff@@ te , through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclop@@ edia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective them are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories but also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how they appear with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in hand from the disciplines of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ ute from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still am still alive when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be fores@@ een in the Com@@ ic@@ buch , but if they should do it , it will be welcomed into the middle of the room by the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ator , which seem like hor@@ des of Protest@@ ants .
that was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ne were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that under@@ lines the Chelsea , like the movement , which tasted before their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a land@@ wide human hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday were issued for the Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest because of their alle@@ ged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Court of C@@ ook County .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ ADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to meet the code which describes the criteria for the re @-@ determination of R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned above is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities would have to publicly accept the reported results of the &quot; W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian and Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren .
regarding the matter of Mut@@ ko : &quot; we conduct the examination because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has encountered a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that is not there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
talking to the Russian sales point R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report embr@@ aced positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has before , accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ ADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als by the W@@ ada on the execution of d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ d@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main quarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director@@ ate @-@ General Olivier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ ADA was moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sold eggs any more
this shared the Group &apos;s groups .

from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ L@@ igh@@ ts@@ el .
Al@@ di wanted to make clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to match your staff the luck in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - che@@ ating .
and even if you said An@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not m@@ our@@ n the process .
&quot; there was never any consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has received people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the w@@ ax@@ es to help companies figure out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to address pol@@ arity , speci@@ ality groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers allow the C @-@ suite managers to deal and get directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up Gl@@ int , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees engagement .
she said that she gained a better look at what your employees think and feel with gl@@ int in the three years .
in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company focusing on a glance which units have the majority of complaints and which managers have low queries - so you can re@@ bo@@ wer why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture we have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ als , who describes an environment of har@@ as@@ ings , with those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups such as Gl@@ int , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , following the fin@@ anz@@ Technical website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as gl@@ int , Conver@@ cent company tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s &quot; to collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat card of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with the staff to log in .
and when the main business leader is included , complaints directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent .
when a company is found that its employees treated badly or beha@@ ved un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , workers &quot; fluctu@@ ations and complaints , &quot; Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , Conver@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their business central .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints from staff .
now , as the company Conver@@ cent uses , problems that were hi@@ red before ex@@ ecutives , who were hi@@ red in offices in cities or countries - like discrimination , har@@ as@@ sment or uns@@ afe traine@@ es are identified faster and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view in the experience with employment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and employees working in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen for eth@@ ic violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media zu &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology for monitoring the ethics , people often use hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Gl@@ int and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and load the company with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors , who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding from companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital with which the entire capital has been raised to $ 47 million .
gem@@ on won $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely unexpected , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is an increasing complex of research which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only in@@ serts .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are glad to be in a company that their voices heard , and that the work that you do is worth it , then said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Linked@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent as well as gl@@ int .
investors can achieve profits when their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well when employees work and engaged .
if the Analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and the use of the staff to increase , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a firm will not take actions .
in fact , when a company ask staff according to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can grow and motiv@@ ate them to be de@@ motiv@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to have reli@@ ed on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
take care of it ?
and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison re@@ ed , which now passes a monthly team of employees , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day when a problem on gl@@ int will be reported so that ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company gets always new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better li@@ aison of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said W@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A re@@ moves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for bru@@ ising
it runs at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise areas of the team on the campus .
some have moved their tri@@ angles parts and show the back of swe@@ at from the first day of the workout .
for a good part of the team , they represent a lunch break @-@ up for a good part of the team .
players who are registered for the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final check before they return the next morning at 6 : 30@@ am to the Aqu@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the players already packed .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the break starts at the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , during the early season while Mor@@ as six hours were pract@@ ised in West@@ wood exercises .
they should keep in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he has to support the change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further aspect to the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremendous burden for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they have simply pushed it , they are great people , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is ended , what given the clear sight@@ ings of its fields of an adjacent car park and the ad@@ joining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already dre@@ amed of a protective net behind a tor@@ pen , no easy task will be .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a dre@@ aming that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room and then adjust to an exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too big worried about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fact in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false over@@ hau@@ ling of third parties and display their results under the original membership , commented on the world &apos;s largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ news .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to recognize potential mis@@ steps and to send them to Fak@@ ten@@ aud@@ itor , which may show results of the actual test paper from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the major F@@ ake News called F@@ ake News , many of whom believe they have also affected the US presidential elections .
the problem also has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flood@@ ed with false stories in May with false stories , and Germany shall support a plan according to social media networks , if it did not succeed , set @-@ filled post@@ ings like before the elections there in September rapidly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; next to the recognition , which stories of fact @-@ aud@@ itors d@@ third parties are challenged , the people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; Sarah Su , Produ@@ cer for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news fe@@ eder to reduce wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic print : a lock in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a si@@ p for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ er years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River valley in K@@ ent and now is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ Shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manus@@ cript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says sore .
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;@@ um@@ ming the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented their families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &quot; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only have responded to the thum@@ b on the page of a letter that was written by a Doppel@@ ag@@ enten in the 1700 @-@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always cra@@ wl back , because back then one cur@@ led a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect , as if he even were there .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who , so with old papers is that he lived by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little bit of a welcome , &quot; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days exploring the Victor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; Castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ och@@ ists of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated by the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscap@@ ing , fer@@ ry@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations for his book .
then , at night he drank he &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last awakening , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes was a decade later , the staff just started to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ ocr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ ing it on the attic . &quot;
day@@ books , letters from the time of the English Em@@ pi@@ res , maps , represent who what poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that land fli@@ cts be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar to have batt@@ led the two families .
guys , let all go his gang ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on bre@@ iter@@ er base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who re@@ constructed the newly built castle in order to join the farm up of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il , which stood in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book called &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the farm was started in this area and I thought a u@@ prising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jes@@ uit &apos; history that was hidden in the English Reformation for seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented at the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who filled his own bu@@ rial ground by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ oks to always make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men del@@ ve their debt cr@@ ying by married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote salvation . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique writing experience
he has had a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on El@@ der@@ än@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ itary from the early 20th century , which has since been returned from nature again .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I must be finished again with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ oping of the 301 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef on Friday started her campaign for introducing a new umbrella ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team are at home to hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan .
in the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday activated website .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen very well aware of the beauty and at@@ tr@@ activ@@ eness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it goes to more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a common promise , a one which gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able all @-@ setting features . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally it stand in competition with other municipalities .
a moderate five @-@ dig@@ it amount makes the town of Bad Honnef their new umbrella and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara the Upper Military Council ( Y@@ as ) over Pen@@ sion@@ ists and transportation in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session did not take place in the Court of Staff , as formerly , but in the official office of the Prime Minister .
at the proceedings of the Heads of State , the five Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers also took the five Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the trans@@ itions .
the government draws the bre@@ wing in the military .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Staff College Hul@@ usi Acc@@ ar in office , but the com@@ man@@ ure of the army , of air forces and nav@@ y were ab@@ duc@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p has spot@@ ted 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the alle@@ ged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire drawing of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who are directly involved in the coup attempt , is negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan said the overthrow as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the Ar@@ med Forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really hold the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; released an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the military @-@ head@@ quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , there &apos;s concerns over a growing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which man@@ if@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ let bot@@ s for sol@@ ub@@ lic@@ ers , wrote the newspaper .
the gener@@ osity in the army and the security guards continues .
in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan per decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 nationalities , among them 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 54@@ 6 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan did the military .
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times they ruled in calling on their role as gu@@ ardian of the world order organisation .
after his election victory 2002 Erdo@@ gan returns the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officials say Erdo@@ gan t@@ rei@@ be targeted towards a Islam@@ ization of the Ar@@ med Forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; was a well @-@ called officers who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if that meets , such an evolution could not be cold .
in any case , in the Alliance after inf@@ ants , there is doubt in the operational read@@ iness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees above to lower the legal immigrants at 5@@ 0,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the visa of vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can party and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will come up the candidates who have financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge of our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry of Service wants to make route for racing lifts
over the past few months over the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les have been disp@@ uted - it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ oon track , on which the tourist train moves , will be built .
in order to ensure the future of the race in the long @-@ term , according to information of the Department of Transport , this year will begin to work on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with deciding to order to order the track of Il@@ men@@ au racing track , the country has become particularly important for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the Secretary of Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the track has been estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
this sum applies 75 percent to the country .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , will currently be final aligned , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as a provider are already unified about the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the timetable that are trad@@ ed on the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus , the racing left @-@ shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the racing car shuttle is mainly a popular rail link between train stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
during the last few months it has been tested in the course of a pilot company whether the track is utilized by sufficient many people to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts very steep .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought that there will be no more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , in fact .
sex robots are currently a big cause .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ iti@@ zed Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and the type of fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny but the companies deliver loads of it and we will get them much more often &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sex@@ lu@@ gs have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ic with a si@@ lic@@ it that feels warm and become aware of human reactions , which will be achieved by the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robots according to their beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of its fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there will be more wor@@ rying because many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities who would have a step@@ ford @-@ wife progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sexy &apos;s co@@ bs have developed to robot@@ ic with a si@@ lic@@ on .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robots makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing as rel@@ ent@@ edness .
and then there is the &quot; True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programm@@ ed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; who con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ atter@@ ing and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us personality . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so they like what you like and she does not like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - really like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , being fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robot@@ ic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the pro@@ w@@ ning female qualities , the wor@@ rying on rape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( name here : counter @-@ up ) Far@@ rah is a most uncomfortable one .
on his website promised True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is stated on the website .
however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex toys .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .
most men will of course keep no sex robots , and whilst the FR@@ R has noticed their rising popularity , they remain always pro@@ visional at the edge of consumer culture .
but what sho@@ red out of the edge @-@ zones you can live in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not od@@ d or insul@@ ting , until they have given permission to give them the free market .
but there is a certain rem@@ n@@ ant that these highly developed sex robots are in a time when the women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has spl@@ itted to have women sexually attacked .
the horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the in@@ und@@ ated body and the pronounced eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not true women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot part or simply separate yourself from their companions .
they do not have a placement or a background history , nothing , which could hin@@ der on independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
otherwise expressed : they are counter@@ f@@ ous slaves .
or to put it in the opinion of 2017 : maid
m@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense
it has become a bin@@ ge of the Tr@@ ump era that political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ ering announced in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relative .
we are all sup@@ pos@@ edly alle@@ ged to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power tr@@ umps to accommodate families .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ oriented seal , who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , having fought for decades because of politics suddenly and quite peculi@@ ar on the same side .
the essence of the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it doesn &apos;t matter in a further context that this brings about significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump but the det@@ ention effect of his presidency has the force to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and cl@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ acious possibility that his mom &apos;s kittens will no longer be rep@@ el .
there is however a terri@@ fying long @-@ time scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as in@@ comprehen@@ sible of denial .
I find myself nowadays from an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s version of the re@@ sig@@ nation - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - which occurs both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact one as very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must only be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as imm@@ eas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York City &apos;s Park , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all C@@ low@@ ns are k@@ on@@ ous and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ ster and the climate per@@ sever@@ ing music does this in strange way .
so many stereotyp@@ es of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
five years later , and I still didn &apos;t miss throughout the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage is - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not included - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , since here two years old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year old can go on it and have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full scores , but fortunately no one asked him afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the Coffee @-@ House on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pick up the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping money - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ati@@ fying while I made tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars .

last year he was brought to hospital thanks to the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh to hospital he suffered the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ as was condemned because of murder after a appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first crus@@ hing appeal .
he k@@ issed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by having taken them several times by a door of the Toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ab@@ ine in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ as claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night @-@ time intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to ign@@ ite this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ as App@@ ell , from which they say it is too indul@@ gent .
the National Criminal regulatory authorities said that they will raise the Supreme Court of South Africa decision on the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is risk that his sentence increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .

as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ t@@ lers from F@@ lange and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and to the main schools were released .
three of the students will go to the school in future , four to the real school .
Schul@@ le@@ ction in Angel@@ ika K@@ itte greeted the parents and representative of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder an young eagle , who grow in the chicken , but then released their freedom .
in addition , the m@@ und@@ ane Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in Ch@@ ick@@ n@@ erhof . &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and left it to his h@@ ens .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle comes out .
but the hope to make of it a chicken , sh@@ attered , the eagle scre@@ wed up on a high mountain his wings and escap@@ ed .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the installation of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .

his determination be to be free .
they wish to receive any four @-@ t@@ lers that he felt in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there followed thank@@ fully to the colleagues , the former Schul@@ ter Michael Müller , who still jump in teaching and parents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parents &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the glo@@ ve period is now over , explained class teachers Sophia Schu@@ macher .
she decre@@ e her students after two years of teaching only very ung@@ ern because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ lers .
to finish all students end a song of summer time and holiday season .

software update for diesel cars : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update takes place ?
must be able to participate in diesel drivers ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
you should improve the g@@ ass@@ ing of cars of the Euro 5 emissions from 5 to some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are taken away .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the trad@@ ed software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the cars , the Schum@@ announces software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin .
their retro@@ fit has arranged the AC @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a high @-@ level implementation in the next few months , but is still not included in an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if a inspection should be obvious , it will be done in their frame .
how long have the transform@@ ations to go up ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the relationship between the commitment of the manufacturers as well as of political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen voluntarily , the car manufacturers are not acting upon the issue of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE supplies for waiting .
probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ im@@ print , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now threatening a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions where chassis thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there are so far no value added for older diesel .
the ACE supplies , with a sale still to be seen .

the most progressive TV series on @-@ rep@@ ur@@ ate lau@@ re@@ ate Le@@ ar was therefore already announced to reno@@ un@@ ce the participation in the g@@ ala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presidency has chosen to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and it bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify their views .

we do the city vi@@ vid
roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in the coming year in R@@ ente .
the passage is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he con@@ veys in the press .
he tells of varied , but also challenging tasks that are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , there is no application to fulfill the application profile .
the city looks for the next time an architect or building engineer .
in compliance with the regulatory notice period , there must be enough time for development .
da Has@@ lach for the administration of the administration as a sub@@ ordin@@ ant authority has to act , the applic@@ ant must proceed with corresponding conclusions .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would they no longer be able to fill them out , would have to drive citizens for advice up to Off@@ enburg .
but citi@@ zenship is important to the city and itself , it says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company li@@ ma and a good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office a number of important projects have accum@@ ulated , looking back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city lively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the pre@@ cip@@ her @-@ parking lot are appro@@ ached .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kin@@ zig@@ Bridge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all wait great tasks on my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
stran@@ gl@@ aged , there is a great game room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ ch@@ yard and gardening can be easily re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker and the design of the green lines is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old city stands as ensemble under monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye on what to pur@@ se , &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , stressed the schei@@ d Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
in any case the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs above my table . &quot;
with regard to support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this Manfred Sch@@ maier for ten years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify with the place and want to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company li@@ ma , but also for the further development of the city .
who wants to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker should be able to show information about the town of Has@@ lach a completed study as a Dipl@@ omin@@ genie@@ ur or Bachelor with Fach@@ richtung Archit@@ ects and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction rights .

bicycle on lines dis@@ closed : South@@ side trail locked
according to polic@@ y@@ makers we had previously thre@@ aten the blue bicycle from the railway station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were sever@@ ely damaged so that the recur@@ ring freight train had to be hal@@ ted .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male activities and are searching for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ ort , witnesses were witn@@ essed a ros@@ ar @-@ oter and a bicycle driver has been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ gger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch at APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the or the perpet@@ rators would have taken himself in danger and put pressure in danger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the late @-@ in @-@ operation and the costs of rail transport , the rail customers could also send to the perpet@@ rators .
overall , from a &quot; significant &quot; amount , &quot; the spokes@@ man said .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southwest track could be guided without a disability .
nearly 10 persons on Friday were Friday afternoon , two of them considered the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ aus was not falling out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres above .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate can help IB@@ D ( inflammation ) to lin@@ dern
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study is claim@@ ing exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could re@@ lie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bow@@ ls .
the incur@@ able condition that affects in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , caused by stomach @-@ fights and ble@@ eding , recur@@ rent or bloody hex@@ es , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers usually get sick , meat and dairy products , to re@@ lie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University out that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an from proteins to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant represent@@ ations .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells at the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , in order to make sure that dam@@ aging micro@@ bes which hide in the food not into the body .
cells , which are capable of rede@@ em@@ ing inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without har@@ ness tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal disease .
in experiments was found that a type of tolerance the immune cells occurs in mice , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in its income .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the components of proteins to resolve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a bacterial and Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ th@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ rich diet will toler@@ ate less anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal intest@@ inal flu@@ ency if the same system also suits people .
the Post@@ do@@ kt@@ or@@ and@@ in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ sear@@ ched a kind of imm@@ cell that promotes tolerance than they found that a group of studies such cells had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that had not taken separately so this was not .
you assumed that the difference had to do with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i who usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
the mice of the mice were inserted DNA @-@ sequ@@ encing and were found six bacterial types , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them f@@ law@@ ed with mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they l@@ acked a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ th@@ i and imm@@ unity cells .
to understand how the bacteria executed on the immune system , the researchers led L. rep@@ ter@@ i in a liquid , and then led small amounts of liqui@@ ds - without the bacteria - at un@@ mature immune cells , which have been isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of fluid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 actic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the food case , the number of such cells decreased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ th@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known whether to develop tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an out@@ products made of L. rep@@ ter@@ i the cells in humans as in mice , but Def@@ ective in the genes in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ amed bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an increase of this population . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , the wind would not be described in the approach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the surprising fac@@ tional loss of a Green MPs brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the election elections lost its red @-@ green coalition with its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ German business leader Michael Kell@@ ner has promp@@ ted the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ n@@ ige Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Grünen @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen asked to return her mandate .
crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear pre@@ tense of the elec@@ tor@@ ate .
El@@ ke T@@ westen has immediately required its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive manager and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the Ed@@ itorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ted a SPD electoral campaign , as a Friday morning the new Hi@@ ke@@ b@@ inger reaches the party central scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD &apos;s prime minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands according to the remains of the green Assembly El@@ ke T@@ westen on the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority .
it is the pro@@ visional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD &apos;s feder@@ ations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery begins with the unexpected defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
an blue eye , more not , so@@ othing the comrades down .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be anything differently .
it was then - and all it became significantly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into di@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the Party itself .
ar@@ du@@ ry the comrades in the weeks after that again .
then when they had just met new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next closure came .
Mayor O@@ laf Scholz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost its Nim@@ bus on this weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned down .
and because he caused quite anything wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Scholz &apos;s struggles for its political survival .
now even Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ bu@@ g@@ ments and his role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has already been in criticism .
mi@@ ese Sur@@ fac@@ e@@ pers were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely therefore , W@@ eil has always tried to put an ever stronger position in the federal government in recent weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover , to build his power in Berlin , comrades not conce@@ aled again in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him give him , as she we@@ ed a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in doing so , W@@ eil does not meet any fault at the third internal constra@@ int , at the same time no fault .
and Schulz already no longer .
once sometimes the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
your wrath is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the deport@@ ation of female parliament@@ arians .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies , like Mrs T@@ westen their own care@@ ers on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Head of the Party Bundestag in the SPD parliamentary group , the Ed@@ itorial Network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms T@@ westen is not elected because of her individual as a direct channel book , but on the Landes@@ list of the Dutch Gre@@ ens to the parliament , so the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Democr@@ at MEPs continue .
the logical consequence would be that she returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ains a &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cho@@ ler@@ o@@ ge four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil as the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who runs the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD as the head @-@ candidate into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career of a future CD@@ U MEPs conf@@ uses the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; votes result &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ordered the backgrounds to resolve .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been additional support from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
Sup@@ porting Society for Det@@ er@@ ern III
who wants to re@@ im@@ print his house in the years can get soon supported by the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g urban development started on Wednesday in Dortmund .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler was once again a review of the previous year .
since 1991 it has been initiated in empi@@ rical renov@@ ations .
back then , in the San@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the State of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the total amount of funding .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dy still lay at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the existing sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the interior development , not only to tap new construction areas .
on April 4th you have received the information of the Government and received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the grant amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros received from the country , the rest of the municipality .
what is the result of a refurb@@ ishment ?
one will continue to investigate the cry , where the &quot; truly old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role to san@@ ish in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the territory could also be postpon@@ ed again .
the ste@@ g dre@@ ad on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; as part of the renov@@ ations would be carried out .
the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alization of domestic cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and extending infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , which is carried per property .
the san@@ itation would then finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for the funding will run since 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey will take place once more , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area to fill out a questionnaire for issu@@ ing .
in November or December , the propos@@ itional dispute will be made possible , so that the next year with the s@@ ings can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every commun@@ e must carry out the above investigations .
it is to evaluate and decide the city &apos;s ab@@ norm@@ alities and decide when to apply and to what extent .
there will also be a san@@ itation in the book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again begin again after received and get a picture of the situation she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the gel@@ be questionnaire is the &quot; building and property conductor , &quot; in which it is among other things around the bau@@ l@@ ative condition and san@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and residential &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can provide information about the size , distribution and residents of an apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only out to fill in the building premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , new measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind @-@ dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work - who first comes , encouraged first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could not make p@@ umping money for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to come up with a handful of movement in house and car . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip so that he can open its door , his office and even start his car with a handful .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fo@@ ref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory ana@@ esth@@ esi@@ sten at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , joined forces to ensure that the im@@ plant procedures will be carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am wants to make the locks for houses and cars like that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the fre@@ eb@@ ies of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a Marine helic@@ opter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that drives American production in the last month , costs tax pay@@ ers according to the fields of the military that have been left to the TIME magazine , up to 24,@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , if the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helic@@ opter in Connecticut has been exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House challenged the presence of the helic@@ opter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter in the South La@@ wn landed , following the records of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the dep@@ uty Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helic@@ opter was on 17 July to 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn were cle@@ ared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restric@@ ting of the hours a second team would need for the flight back .
the original flight time was during the event with the helic@@ opter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the floor .
from the information provided from TIME to stock , it was not clear whether the second aircraft was required .
H@@ atch Act prohib@@ its Federal Foreign Minister to use State property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could damage the purpose .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were advised that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sound , as if you are locked , &quot; rep@@ lied the Deputy Commander .
the &apos; Made in America &apos; was referred to by the White House as official event and would not be covered by H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political super@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway at the Senate , and he pro@@ pag@@ ated efforts to susp@@ ect the governmental regulation .
the use of the aircraft , which as Marine One or Air Force One is known for politically mutually advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the president &apos;s plane in front of his first campaign or@@ bit@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and its Twitter account is full of messages published about the use of the aircraft by its predec@@ essors .
&quot; the White House is delighted by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said dep@@ uty press secret@@ ary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws perform frequently training flights in the region around Washington and South La@@ wn to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze the US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
as a tra@@ p at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 top in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House has conducted 58 exercises .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was in the flight needs for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ik@@ opter units flew in addition 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dents &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in place the helic@@ opter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX records does not endor@@ se budget@@ ary instructions for the presidential day , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the support of the U.S. Defence of the U.S. Department for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D earnings for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight time .
records of unity draw the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the hom@@ eb@@ ase of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost of the operation of the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for publication is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand @-@ Study from 2015 , the plac@@ ements for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week which are produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to emphas@@ ise this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether to join the helic@@ opter , when he became his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver of a fire@@ wood .
in the White House spoke Tr@@ ump to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and Cher@@ bourg with the media over his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before the tricky task

the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss joins tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ ritten Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
in spite of five games still mak@@ ere@@ os@@ er balance , the leaders of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga are given the sense of reality .
team of Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
just on the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV mainly care of imports from the high North .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strongly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ re@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is always hard for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then you need a good serving happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for a trip to the high north is practically approaching .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
does the currently still work with the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella pre@@ diction , not for the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Par@@ tie , the Czech Republic in Czech Liber@@ ec Per@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first deployment in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated ch@@ lie@@ ve Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik Castillo was yesterday with the White An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel but also as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ owe , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vic@@ tories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ k@@ us@@ z could bring back to the team again .
it reaches the 18 @-@ year old Hungary , who was still the number one of the juni@@ ors Wel@@ tran@@ g@@ liste in January 2016 , not to fill someone from the trainer in order to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the o@@ MV
really happy effective Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he placed his signature under the law of the pres@@ um@@ eration of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast , the law to educate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pack@@ aged a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sch@@ ish@@ te against the US court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft starts to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since that , since then , investors from the domestic O@@ MV are to be financed with other European firms in the construction of Russian Ost@@ se@@ el@@ eit@@ ing Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ cul@@ t is extensive .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil group .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions into an Executive Order even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen how the Group could den@@ ounce the Group and which could really w@@ ow it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen staff
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the kids and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ sery @-@ workshops the clock is revers@@ ed .
at the 1st of September the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supplies in municipal nur@@ sery institutions ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance , dep@@ uty chief &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth welfare &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked still except house : a catech@@ ins takes over this task and supplies fresh@@ ly cooked .
the city runs in the district of 46 children &apos;s workshops , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch .
last kit@@ ters , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now not only children who are looked after 45 hours of hours in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ eran@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children are staying at 2 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ fighters have from 1 September kitchen service : they war@@ med the s@@ late food , supplement it to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individual , give the food out , clean down and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned firmly in a cas@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says fri@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group @-@ group entities , and decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen leaves now firmly belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says fri@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so much stronger involved and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help cook the food &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct link of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
these continuity is important for the children .
the inf@@ ants of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - now also task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by specialized cleaning operators .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - along with the quality improvement of the kitchen services also has the charm that it turned out in the cost@@ comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign award for the city as the most economic power , it is called the press office .
and that although 46 sub @-@ time forces are newly assigned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 people in the educ@@ ator area not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB @-@ concern about investment in Mc@@ Vit@@ ie @-@ Fabrik in Glas@@ gow
a trade union would like to be among senior managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company slept on the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .

Mc@@ V@@ ities owners Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union officials would learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the Fili@@ p of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Vice @-@ organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win a clarity about the port@@ needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; concerns our members deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus strongly on the local community and the Groß@@ raum Glas@@ gow , an important pillar for decent employment in a field of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantageous .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , of the Loh@@ ns and of prosperity , and in the light of the Bre@@ xit , the rising of life costs and the chronic production slow@@ down , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently need a thri@@ ving production line at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p in T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland and the company will respond directly to the company , as we estimate its commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , with which some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic li@@ ma , our stores are constantly checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production place . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago in N@@ ey@@ mar ?

Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not re@@ trac@@ ed in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its free@@ wheel cl@@ ause , but have warned them Barcelona three years ago before the landing stage ?
the sens@@ ational approach has been attached to the Trans@@ fer@@ red window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Club is ready to break the world ord with more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned .
after the end is N@@ ey@@ mar to the most expensive players in the world and to the most affordable professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ .000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans board made it that the club has always given its best to care for his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned of three years ago by the PSG @-@ president of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 , interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they know if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona does not seem to have crossed the line , where the Spanish Association began interest in the PSG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer .
what made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese is seeking to witness the police .
because he met a car on his driving line , the driver had to leave a VW Tour@@ an , and tou@@ ch@@ ained the lines plan .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Loc@@ cum is coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the village of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a truck was contrary to his driving force , so that he had to leave right after the right .
tou@@ ch@@ ised the tour @-@ driver the lines plan .
at the end of the truck was the subject of activity .
the driver of the opposite truck , a Mercedes Benz , had out@@ dated a truck and continued his drive without having to worry about traffic accident .
it may well be good after the accident that the Mer@@ c@@ ed@@ es@@ et had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now asked witnesses of the Vor@@ f@@ alle as well as the driver of the previous experience , at Tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 2060 with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht ent@@ last@@ et Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Bericht about the mis@@ use cases ent@@ reli@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to mis@@ use sc@@ andal among the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the Labor Movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication from previous Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the emer@@ al Pap@@ en X@@ VI@@ . , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have expressed deep regret about their own om@@ issions or its then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ized that in reporting on violence in the scr@@ at@@ ching with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one has to dis@@ claim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful actions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but the &quot; degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medi@@ al mani@@ pulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histor@@ ik@@ erin and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the day @-@ day experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to be normal for normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking forward to the church and that &apos;s a bit of fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been a very normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with friends , as I was one , ready to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply the standards in earlier decades because the world has changed .
in the context of the reports on the mis@@ use cases also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who com@@ prised of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he said the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report written by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the clar@@ ification of Ulrich Weber presented ?
a total of 54@@ 7 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s titled &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summar@@ izing is that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence .
especially with high levels of Emot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the student could also be disast@@ rous .
nevertheless , unlike many other mo@@ on@@ ists , it is estimated that many victims f@@ aded the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories of it . &quot;
in the interview of Hes@@ emann , why the final report to mis@@ use sc@@ andal among the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion el@@ ab@@ ed .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ termin@@ ators with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one another , many students raise his &quot; humanity &quot; .
for the other he also appears as a chol@@ ec@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , that of the Ö@@ f@@ teren O@@ b@@ und was not tangible , if a Dom@@ sp@@ leen has not brought a top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages from the front to the back , you have to ask for a question why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger happens at all in it .
it is dedicated straight to eight sides and he is clearly released from every suspic@@ ion of the Mitt@@ ell@@ - or fellow @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence events at the pre @-@ school was ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its efficiency .
at best , you can imagine it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he did , was conceived by practically all respon@@ dents than - literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes him as &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who cat@@ ered guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; was always lag@@ ged from grapes of children .
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emoti@@ on@@ ality which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ brü@@ chen .
that he k@@ ick@@ ed not only with chairs and thre@@ w the k@@ issed and on the ground , but also ear@@ ch@@ ained guys in the hair or ears , he himself gave himself years ago , deeply regret , and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his hon@@ or@@ tion must however be said that such surveys in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s were far pre@@ valent in both parents and teachers .
do you also know such a discipline of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 .
I also saw this in a world@@ ly School , a State Gymnasium .
compared to what it &apos;s actually in this report , namely the dism@@ iss@@ ful sexual abuse and the non@@ violence at the pre @-@ school , are the fre@@ lich dre@@ d@@ els .
you ask yourself whether it is not more with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media had straight on it .
in the Bav@@ arian Pope there are many who never understood it , still s@@ fri@@ ght@@ less .
the truth however is : the report sent by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media in connection with the report much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is placed in the final report as well as any complic@@ ation or complic@@ ity in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual claims claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugur@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dre@@ amed to speak with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a mess@@ enger for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true issue in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims would be silent .
if they do not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir manager , who would have been such a colleague of offen@@ ders a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do you judge the scr@@ at@@ ching students of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ ed student cast it so : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see any case , in which he would have had any evidence ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) of timely findings and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that with it ... Bub@@ bles ins@@ ure or clear@@ er or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , dormit@@ ories , confidentiality teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance the students involved and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse affects , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus fre@@ er from each community .
so it cannot be thrown to him , not to prevent him or put it into the ad .
that is why there is no reason to establish his good name with those contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it was in some cases happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report . &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed to a huge mel@@ ange taken from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
namely , there will be clean separately : between the school and the gramm@@ ar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report was dealt with by the time since 1945 , so out of four decades , in which George R@@ atz@@ inger was not the chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ atzen .
the entire aw@@ ful war@@ ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ k , the cases , in which boys were controlled by sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers , and mal@@ nour@@ ished , s@@ eig@@ ned at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sk@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to be heard .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boys to face as they were already on the cathedral @-@ scr@@ at@@ edness .
on the one , as the most witnesses empha@@ size , the theme of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to be able to come and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ eng@@ th@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there has been discipline , but there is no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims led the general humanity of R. and therefore combine even positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most still the accus@@ ation , have seen away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events in a school , where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again in 1993 .
Ver@@ ended Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the eyes consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the farm , which the report was even re@@ produced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exam@@ inations continue to be practiced at the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press representatives , he recommended urgent immigration .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted , as exam@@ inations were also banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before , they ex@@ propri@@ ated them in a legal gra@@ vey@@ or area , as everyone of us probably knows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was difficult to see it difficult for him , where the persons concerned are perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where truly the permitted border had been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one can not say , he would have always been ch@@ ew@@ ed .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner was officially rela@@ un@@ ched in Bavaria .
Für@@ st@@ in Gl@@ oria was be@@ headed by Th@@ urn und Taxis yes , it is unfair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at the same time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about historians from the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger that it does according to today &apos;s moral standards .
since the prin@@ c@@ ess has already quite right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times , and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resi@@ ding and violence at non @-@ school children &apos;s sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s , which is already far beyond that at that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ celebrations and to pull to the hair and ears were far pre@@ valent in the 19@@ 70s .
as a physical actu@@ ation then it was forbidden , he also strictly found himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger period has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject of checking also to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , therefore Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , there the dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am not at all that he conducted a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment .
but this must once again be said : without this perfection , without the un@@ demanding un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of heritage , true cultural har@@ p@@ ists of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not even make a big singer and in front of every success , just in which area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of human beings do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger among talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : thanks to the work on the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , and cordial people , from which one could not imagine that he could not only be able to do something .
I get regularly with how many former cathedral scr@@ at@@ ching still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency to visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him today that he once was strictly with them , are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and bring them to the world of music .
and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ ous teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a li@@ ke@@ able respect for them , to which they still look up , and to worship them .
and please , once again clear : all that you imagine , are educ@@ ating methods that were at the time the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is a prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ ats .
there is the evil intention that is behind it , just too obvious .
for the report that has just been released , reli@@ eves him .
now the status quo would have earned a 93 @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and perhaps no one could know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen outside of Bavaria , finally in peace .
