<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals of Bavaria, is anything but current - but this is why it is very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current on-line cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, clearly, as towns and churches have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a splattered canvas that recognizes man as such.</seg>

<seg id="15">The French army leader in Bayern since the spring 1800 during the Second Koalitioning war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon did an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographical survey of Bavaria - naturally for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops took place with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a surface area of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued to advance the project, founded the" "" "topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessungsadministration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The charter sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerischer Landesbibliothek.</seg>

<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is submissions, which appear in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated.</seg>

<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: on the first glance: with dozens of dozens lines and numbers: handwriting numbered Flurpieces from the so-called "certificate," derived from the base tax.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots do not show farmers more - but small gardener of the facility" "" "Land in Sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is set north of submissions.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 graphed in the October 19th century, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>

<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldway people once block people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt "At the Auer Lüch."</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard de Gudden brought the institution - that psychiatrist, who is being brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs.</seg>

<seg id="50">Citizens of the voucher for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union to promote color-tone has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri based on the discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, who will take into force until 28 August 2017, invites Afro-American travelers, visitors and misourians, since a series of fragile, razzling-based deposits have occurred recently in the entire state and described here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain a discriminatory claim, as well as the prosecution of the state, the disproportionate on minorities, prompted the group to give the travel warning, the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of the civil rights that people happen." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such cases we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that issued an organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group of incidents such as racist contrasts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died at unquestionably circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline at the beginning of the year and was taken in custody by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed out to a recent report by the office of the General State of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than striches.</seg>

<seg id="64">The travel cancellation is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to complain a company because of living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil LiberUnion (ACSI) had issued any travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed the immigration laws affecting local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to people for immigration, which according to the ACLU on further segregation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are generally issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have employed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecaunproject is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman Weidezaun-Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image in front of the place.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Rechtexcavation of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU place, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann lodged first insights into its operation, in which it covers 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest enebed, 40 milk, and as many young people, and houses in five apartments of Ferienges.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is for him the alternative marker path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Ferienges only comes local.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a pro-president of Fisherbach, he referred the Weizaunprojekt as "elemental."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not build on such steep areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area is a lot of work, much of which can be edited using the Motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteral operation and crops this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not lead a biofarm.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the decay project and is pleased with the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">The costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare would have to support farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the reforestation of the areas could be carried out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and worry about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the pastries support, in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is 40 hectares, which must not be unenforted up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">From the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half over Leader is funded, a quarter carried the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, they condured the farmers 12 610 Euros, which had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of course.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landlady."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Care (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of ordination.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the offensive-holding of the Schwarzwalds.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisites are the presence of one of the LPR marked funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosures of the area should not be worse. (hangings over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman Weidelaunproject 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build up at almost 16 kilometres fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area is 35 hectares, which are low-calculated costs with more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty at</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to push the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the carefree of Saddam Husseins on the Firen Platz in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key invologues of the trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a sad dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals by the President to the drastic restriction of the legal migration with the statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not take the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A Horde of Boatoccupants and Liberty-Imitators would have suffered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attained their importance, and in particular the importance that it was written than the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base has been added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that has illuminated the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem on which you refer to which later was added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is knowledgeable, but as he deformated it, it does not really matter of history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the discontinued words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only charge any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "" "" "" "" your poor, "" "" your arms, who longing for it, freely to breathe, / the flowing waste of your rich coasts. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "elastic waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller committed himself not in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation, it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who translated their words to their death on the basis - knew very well that they performed a highly-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, indicating the feminine embodiment of the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great Write Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the deception for the comump of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was no one, but rather an early Neocalimentary that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of view of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhaustive but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It's true that the world is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that you would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the path, but the hate, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">Worldchampionship 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the UK</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to team team.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "her captain's speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or where they live or train, went out of the room and were very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feel that Eilidh brought quite naturally, were magnificent. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medallier winning player who will compete at its fifth World Championship with the 400-m hurdle, says that it is "unbelievable," that 16 Schots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best whole athlets at the World Championship was seven, the 1983 and 2015 have been reached.</seg>

<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare who runs 1,500 m is another shot you should observe after a great season, which should include victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The Mannists Egeries says that they are "enormously proud of" the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be a team of team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honor to know, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and chose to make it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to Podes.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech to be referred to as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it's really important to put on this home support and benefit that we are at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block reviews on Facebook: bewiring you not for a public post if you can not wear the influx of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew anything of the poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He swept in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and wordless, we are led like the sheep." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who must work on to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">The iconic employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and erased that their opinion is voiced on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties defendant him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the governor had the lawsuit as freezing, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprising.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 Governor of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very happy to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hairy head on chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockade of individuals who come to the governor of the governor - who is a public forum that is officially referred to as officially and by collaborators who are paid by public tax funds - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post of Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockade of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of TROLLEN or spammers or hens-filled people who vibrate online the lash-way.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who are speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a role.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtfully and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appeal to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD., was not hated, but she asked to Hassan Hassan.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I met politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other latest news," "" "wrote them in the commentary box of the" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take on the same subject, they are abused by some more than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the employees of the governor as" concentrated "" "" concentrated "" "" would probably call "" "" interdiscussion "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it simple to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same that staff was sent to gather newspapers with critical conductors and to burn or to get rid of demonstrators, and to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is just digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is scourted by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this matter was the last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County missed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District ters James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they called a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit of the ACSI because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect like the internet.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial fair-play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA in Life mean that PSG must point at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to purchase the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar is received a salary that will be more than ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars Move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure money casual with certainty to bring Neymar and bring him to galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy of the rich glacial family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations should use a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to engage with legitimate entries to give them the break-down point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that in their quest for success enormous debt had to be taken, effectively cheating and risky to ruin, when banks or owners withdrawn their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP had to rely on the debt of the club to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that was used by Roman Abramovich originally 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then powerfully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP contraction period, which runs until 2018, you may accept losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA successor was Aleksander Ceferin to continue to terrify from excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG paid the buy-out clause by Neymar in a package, they can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year agreement, so that the dissolution can be reported for the next five years in the amount of 44,4 million euros in the year-leaving qualification.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has come together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a bill of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars) which later dropped to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams members are limited for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to avail her financial supervision by setting up their income through companies, which are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catalytic company could sponders if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard markings, the UEFA does not apply this as legitimation income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA was produced by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could be made by payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup 2022, in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">"" "" "" "but PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar WM Ambassador will be made and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulators simply could figure out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA still offers more attentive, every attempt to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no pre-preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, saged on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of over EUR 10 million in 2015, a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the final financial year are still to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring Deals, merchandising and tricotting sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association considers that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent Neymars's wayman by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in regards to Katar's latter's ownership." ""</seg>

<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former Bankerin with a passion for real estate, resulting in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not unpacked and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court, and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a slaughing layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal cover height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The blanket was not big enough to place two spaces in one another, so that the architectural challenge consisted in keeping a mezzanine which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms that they were rushed to each other without needing to decorate ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that he had the right amount for the function above or down. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place a fan, two spaces in full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper window of retreat from Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Speckled Goldfurniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of spires plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer units for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamoury space the beauty of the living room can tap the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a gardenum.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains the fan of the steel-reinforced, terrible MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is not so important that it is when you slide the door very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the base size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high quality materials which make the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not forget you in the electric plugs in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metric number by slightly moderate in something quite admirable.</seg>

<seg id="1397">President Trumpy relationship to TV extends decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>

<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons and to bring about doubtful information.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is recalled because of the lack of drought, and due to disease transfering insects, leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian institution CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet elsewhere to check their plans for the coverage of the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what are safer: you should take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with granites, or they leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words to a plate on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the Reporter, to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal things.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs sheers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are diluted to stand on the hearing list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no fame of violence, and while throughout the country the corpens accumulate, are more and more journalists at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 has ended its office. 589 are standing after attacks and threats, and so far, there were at least seven abote in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter there is their publishers and their inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence will be felt deep, although its presence anywhere is present - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his mid-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the frontage of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who showed his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was established a Sonya's office in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the committee has led to the protection of journalists just two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders who are connected every year with drug dealers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely put before judgment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist that the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even betrayed.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to wasting my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why we know why we are all" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez abandoned the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He made it just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was halted by two men. he was forced by his car and 12 times was shot at it, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - that is translated with "twelve.</seg>
<seg id="1830">The archer was driving in his car and damaged it close by.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be free to fly in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans reclamation last year and the delivery into the United States in January was Sinaloa has become one of the most bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of seperate, two-story hoeen for drug rounders which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of calm, if only a box has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Buorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the debt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of a rivalled cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to time-tipping trailers.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing will be seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had so long survived that his friends and colleagues were approaching that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was working as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encounter the antidote issue," "" "said Boerquez." ""</seg>

<seg id="1848">Reporter would like to publish hard-hearing tests without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication, in which they could read stories, who asked anyone else to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors" "" "award for its coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs, where ever they were leading.</seg>

<seg id="1860">Well ask them: was his love for routine his rubbing?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions on how to carry out their work best and to stay alive.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Boerquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-zensur and self-preservation.</seg>

<seg id="1866">If there was wrong, stay away from it.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this crop is covered, although he is covered with an armor and resembles a changing shell, probably threatened by meat and hade dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strong armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a skyline that is known as a countertenor, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This could have enabled to mix better in his surroundings and to soak its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and it was called Borealopelta-mitchelli after the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours it has been careful.</seg>

<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread Defense method in the animal, which means the tip of the creature darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter is common, the results are surprisingly, as the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>

<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals, using the counter-shaded - think of deer, zebras or traveller - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong beast-behavior on a massive, strongly dred dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been to the Cretaceous," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organised connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was reddish brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on clues about his life, including his preservated Darminate to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, went out into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you have taken its place and therefore used the ticket.</seg>

<seg id="2001">You also have to have bought it via the app of the railway, the DB navigator, which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket receipt.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she had arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrollte by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year child, and it is still on the road," "" "was it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, because no one had posted the information on her Feed, closed her Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handshake @ theePharoah was constantly referred to as Timeline retweetet.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., killed to tweet live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He postete a picture of maple's crowned body, which was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is yes wild," I thought of himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to tweet later in the evening to tweets on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, the cribes, and by a man who said Brock's father, who carried a sign with the inscription: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live-feeling, where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bellum dog.</seg>

<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would take the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, of love and resistance, which is from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrel with her daughter, who carried a flower garment and a suitable crown, carried to Ferguson, besought the two a conversation that they had countless times before this morning, over the black experience and the black condition.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "do you remember how I have taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe?" "" "remember they remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take it, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and it must be and raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">She needs to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do is free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the luck to give her an experience where she has not experienced any ekled racism, it is no different than the next black female child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which was moved to a Campsite as the activist to the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There appeared in Ferrell and her daughter with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after the 9th of August," said and noting that she was elected as a student at the University of Missouri Saint Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience at the Organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to his sense. "do you want to document, or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often of whites - in a community that profited from their pain and its resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As follow up recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who are born and grew up in Ferguson, have not centered on their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism around Todestrakt-inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought his project closer together, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brock's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, because in this way I will be presented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that the movement is not related to a Messiah's guide, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the revealed participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells Life as she loves to love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work and the human being of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells has repeated history the role of black wls women in the broader Black-Lives-movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media after the killing of the Black Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leaders have carried a whole overall," "" "said Ferrell," "", "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women need to carry the main last of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan unanimously to remark that "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It consists however, that "this is not a affirmatisive type of action," when Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film by Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who sprinkled this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although it was at the front front, because with a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy from the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news items in Ferguson have long ago disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the advocates develop that a gallery draws more customers into the city, the remaining shops will benefit, fear the opponents that then the pedestrian zone bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be carefully planned on the ground on which the farm market hall is on the 13 direct market to its products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and there is a need for Beda to be sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many counter-shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall is not fit together for me.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - cheating.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you said Anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never any consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>

<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it allows companies to address polarity, speciality groups and demographic groups, and in some cases whistleblowers allow the C-suite managers to deal and get directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and FitBit for the persecution of their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">She said that she gained a better look at what your employees think and feel with glint in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company focusing on a glance which units have the majority of complaints and which managers have low queries - so you can rebower why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture we have to stay, so that you won't be the next uber who has been involved in Skandals, who describes an environment of harasings, with those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth, following the finanzTechnical website Let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw a rising interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As glint, Convercent company tailor-made "Puls" to collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat card of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with the staff to log in.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is included, complaints directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that its employees treated badly or behaved unethically, it can experience precious consequences by consumers-boycott, workers "fluctuations and complaints," Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant-chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their business central.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company central, a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints from staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that were hired before executives, who were hired in offices in cities or countries - like discrimination, harassment or unsafe trainees are identified faster and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360 degree view in the experience with employment" "", "said Vitrano, who leads the risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and load the company with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital with which the entire capital has been raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Gemon won $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are barely unexpected, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is an increasing complex of research which shows that today's employees expect more than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only inserts.</seg>

<seg id="2242">"when people are glad to be in a company that their voices heard, and that the work that you do is worth it, then said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent as well as glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can achieve profits when their portfolio companies are well run. companies run well when employees work and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the Analytics tools of third parties promise, commitment and the use of the staff to increase, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a firm will not take actions.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company ask staff according to your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough or not at all, these disappointments can grow and motivate them to be demotivate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company to have relied on collecting data.</seg>

<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets always new insights about the staff, and it hopes that in a long run, this leads to a better liaison of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Wrano.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that there will be no more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, in fact.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big cause.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritized Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny but the companies deliver loads of it and we will get them much more often" "", "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexlugs have evolved from their inflatable partners to robotic with a silicit that feels warm and become aware of human reactions, which will be achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robots according to their beliefs, "and select everything from the eye of the robot via the form of nipples up to the type or color of its fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but there will be more worrying because many robots have" "" "personalities who would have a stepford-wife progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexy's cobs have developed to robotic with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robots makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing as relentedness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the "True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities like" Frigid Farrah, "who conveys the impression of shattering and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality which is adapted to your personality as good as possible" "", "warms the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So they like what you like and she does not like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - really like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, being fixed on conversation or she can" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the prowning female qualities, the worrying on rape, if one goes a step on Frigid (name here: counter-up) Farrah is a most uncomfortable one.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website promised True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a VIBRATOR, why can men have no Roxxxy?" it is stated on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement indicate a bit darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robots, and whilst the FRR has noticed their rising popularity, they remain always provisional at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what shored out of the edge-zones you can live in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not odd or insulting, until they have given permission to give them the free market.</seg>
<seg id="2414">But there is a certain remnant that these highly developed sex robots are in a time when the women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has splitted to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the inundated body and the pronounced eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not true women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot part or simply separate yourself from their companions.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have a placement or a background history, nothing, which could hinder on independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Otherwise expressed: they are counterfous slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the opinion of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Mumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of the common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binge of the Trump era that political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankering announced in the USA newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump-chosen relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly alleged to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power trumps to accommodate families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-oriented seal, who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House is everyone who knows it, including the Republican kinship, having fought for decades because of politics suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The essence of the dining table is certainly a good thing, but it doesn't matter in a further context that this brings about significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump but the detention effect of his presidency has the force to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and clump, we refer to the gracious possibility that his mom's kittens will no longer be repel.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is however a terrifying long-time scenario, normalized in the Trump republicans of the right wing, "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as incomprehensible of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's version of the resignation - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - which occurs both compared to Trump in fact one as very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the republicans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Karussells of New York City's Park, and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the Fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all Clowns are konous and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely finster and the climate persevering music does this in strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many stereotypes of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines will become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five years later, and I still didn't miss throughout the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss Cottage is - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not included - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magic experience, since here two years old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year old can go on it and have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him the full scores, but fortunately no one asked him afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the Coffee-House on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pick up the rating with a 15% tipping money - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowing of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing gratifying while I made tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital thanks to the treatment of sleigh to hospital he suffered the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistas was condemned because of murder after a appeal of the prosecutors against a first crushing appeal.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He kissed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by having taken them several times by a door of the Toilettenkabine in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistas claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night-time intruder, who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to ignite this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistas Appell, from which they say it is too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal regulatory authorities said that they will raise the Supreme Court of South Africa decision on the Supreme Court of South Africa and the claim can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is risk that his sentence increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is claiming exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflamed bowls.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects in the US around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, caused by stomach-fights and bleeding, recurrent or bloody hexes, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers usually get sick, meat and dairy products, to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University out that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant representations.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells at the intestine patrol, in order to make sure that damaging microbes which hide in the food not into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of redeeming inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harness tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory intestinal disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments was found that a type of tolerance the immune cells occurs in mice, which carry a specific bacterium in its income.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the components of proteins to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a bacterial and Lactobacillus reuthi - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet will tolerate less anti-inflammatory intestinal intestinal fluency if the same system also suits people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersearched a kind of immcell that promotes tolerance than they found that a group of studies such cells had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had not taken separately so this was not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">You assumed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomen of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi who usually live in the stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were inserted DNA-sequencing and were found six bacterial types, which were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them flawed with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuthi and immunity cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria executed on the immune system, the researchers led L. repteri in a liquid, and then led small amounts of liquids - without the bacteria - at unmature immune cells, which have been isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of fluid has been cleaned, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as an Indol-3 actic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food case, the number of such cells decreased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuthi in our stomach-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether to develop tryptophan outproducts made of L. repteri the cells in humans as in mice, but Defective in the genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflamed bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Bericht entlastet Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Bericht about the misuse cases entrelied Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report to misuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Labor Movement "We are Church," stated after publication from previous Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeral Papen XVI., an excuse.</seg>

<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the grips in Regensburg, no one has to disclaim" "" "shameful and shameful actions" "", "but the" degree "" "" medial manipulation "" "," so the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committees. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the day-day experience and prepares public opinion to be normal for normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we are looking forward to the church and that's a bit of frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" "" "has been a very normal pedagogical means," "" "to deal with friends, as I was one, ready to finish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply the standards in earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In the context of the reports on the misuse cases also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who comprised of" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "(in 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he said the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report written by the diocese Regensburg with the clarification of Ulrich Weber presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were victims between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s titled "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "summarizing is that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high levels of Emotionality, the punishment for the student could also be disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other moonists, it is estimated that many victims faded the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories of it. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview of Hesemann, why the final report to misuse scandal among the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion elabed.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of non-terminators with the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one another, many students raise his "humanity".</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as a cholecker and perfectionist, that of the Öfteren Obund was not tangible, if a Domspleen has not brought a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages from the front to the back, you have to ask for a question why the name Georg Ratzinger happens at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is dedicated straight to eight sides and he is clearly released from every suspicion of the Mittell- or fellow-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence events at the pre-school was expropriated outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, you can imagine it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The "" "" "" "Domspatzenga" "" "on which he did, was conceived by practically all respondents than - literally -" "" "salvation" "", "heaven" and "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also describes him as "warm", "sincere," "competent" and "understandably", "as extremely good-natured teacher, who catered guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and" was always lagged from grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his great emotionality which also led to Wutausbrüchen.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he kicked not only with chairs and threw the kissed and on the ground, but also earchained guys in the hair or ears, he himself gave himself years ago, deeply regret, and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honortion must however be said that such surveys in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s were far prevalent in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such a discipline of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also saw this in a worldly School, a State Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it's actually in this report, namely the dismissful sexual abuse and the nonviolence at the pre-school, are the frelich dredels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself whether it is not more with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media had straight on it.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the Bavarian Pope there are many who never understood it, still sfrightless.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth however is: the report sent by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger is placed in the final report as well as any complication or complicity in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual claims claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dreamed to speak with my father or mother," "" "said a messenger for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in educating sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims would be silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they do not even trust parents and siblings, certainly not a choir manager, who would have been such a colleague of offenders a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you judge the scratching students of Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student cast it so: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see any case, in which he would have had any evidence (Georg Ratzinger) of timely findings and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that with it... Bubbles insure or clearer or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, dormitories, confidentiality teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance the students involved and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse affects, Georg Ratzinger is thus freer from each community.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be thrown to him, not to prevent him or put it into the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">That is why there is no reason to establish his good name with those contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it was in some cases happened.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "the media was much of" "" "violence" "" "with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed to a huge melange taken from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the midst of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there will be clean separately: between the school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence and, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report was dealt with by the time since 1945, so out of four decades, in which George Ratzinger was not the chorus of the cathedral-atzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The entire awful warpedagogik, the cases, in which boys were controlled by sadistic teachers, and malnourished, seigned at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really skandalous states have to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys to face as they were already on the cathedral-scratedness.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one, as the most witnesses emphasize, the theme of "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to come and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatengthasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there has been discipline, but there is no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims led the general humanity of R. and therefore combine even positive memories with him in numerous cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most still the accusation, have seen away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events in a school, where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Verended Georg Ratzinger in front of the eyes consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the farm, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that," "" "the examinations continue to be practiced at the pre-school." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press representatives, he recommended urgent immigration.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted, as examinations were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they expropriated them in a legal graveyor area, as everyone of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "there was difficult to see it difficult for him, where the persons concerned are perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where truly the permitted border had been exceeded." ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can not say, he would have always been chewed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner was officially relaunched in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria was beheaded by Thurn und Taxis yes, it is unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about historians from the "pitfalls of anachronism," thus the danger that it does according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Since the princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and also not for what was broken in the preschool of residing and violence at non-school children's shrimps, which is already far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplining and punishment, so ear-celebrations and to pull to the hair and ears were far prevalent in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical actuation then it was forbidden, he also strictly found himself.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburger period has Georg Ratzinger for talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject of checking also to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, therefore Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, there the domspatzen played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not at all that he conducted a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must once again be said: without this perfection, without the undemanding unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form a institution of heritage, true cultural harpists of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, you do not even make a big singer and in front of every success, just in which area, yet discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of human beings do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger among talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: thanks to the work on the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger really very well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, and cordial people, from which one could not imagine that he could not only be able to do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regularly with how many former cathedral scratching still today, 23 years after his Emergency to visit him regularly, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today that he once was strictly with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and bring them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always had a good, väterous teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a likeable respect for them, to which they still look up, and to worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: all that you imagine, are educating methods that were at the time the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is a prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoats.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that is behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the status quo would have earned a 93-old man who has acquired great merits, and perhaps no one could know the Regensburger Domspatzen outside of Bavaria, finally in peace.</seg>
