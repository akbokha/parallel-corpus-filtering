Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramidal pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sear@@ ched for a little variety of colleagues with a horse riding on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Tri@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded of their celebrations , they hunt at home in the fast Gal@@ lop per home .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the riding career ended up again already again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament wins - once again close to horses .
he left him with his family about the plant of AL@@ Z@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t pull himself to picture .
long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also with the CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid over@@ rides the man from An@@ abel@@ in as part of a small g@@ ala the Golden Tri@@ pyramid .
due to it there is not a sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already moved him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the pyr@@ amide .
at Aachen he met the first prize winners Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has promoted the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money to 25.000 Euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 additional excellent sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US m@@ ast winner was taken on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excellent are the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ eten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mitt , der Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ ehmer , der Rah@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , der Spring@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , der ski@@ pping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports were met on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part hi@@ red the illustr@@ ative society into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ tons und Tr@@ ump@@ tions economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the TT@@ P trade agreement - this is just Clinton as well .
Un@@ one is however the two US presidential policy , however , in tax and energy policies , as well as in a basic request .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to be small in doubt and war@@ ns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton had to pun@@ ish the economy of death and regul@@ ating death , he says .
he himself would be quite different from the other hand , says Tr@@ ump .
he will re@@ trac@@ ed regulations , and he makes himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax treasures - for both business people and for businesses .
Clinton who says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has to open quite dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the m@@ isses to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ equal .
the democratic applic@@ ants are not the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ al@@ y @-@ wing of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , there may be an independent internal discussions .
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and drive the coal sales in the United States again .
oil promotion is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to expand into renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far away from one another .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ ic trade deal , do not want to sign them .
at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should then be also better paid for about Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger p@@ itt@@ ance .
it wants to raise it up to $ 15 per hour .
what does not want to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must move , then he says , he should not be changed .
but the major discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump who wants to re@@ lie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him before , so that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
on the other side Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every woman has experienced experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of the women who want to flee , almost all of them to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen sit four women .
each one has a baby that is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arms .
he was curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother lo@@ wer@@ ed on the table top .
until it noticed that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ iss@@ ure the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is an area leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid products in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are fully fle@@ ed .
they live in the Mün@@ chner north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all@@ ained women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and Mün@@ chner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is an Wach@@ au in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted , because they thre@@ aten them torture or death , or because their families send them as a testim@@ onial for Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the run : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sory , honest@@ y mor@@ als , slavery or compul@@ sory notes .
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end once they come in Germany , ir@@ re , told B@@ ahr .
even here all women in refugee can often be seen as a minor and worst at worst .
this leads to some 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the Mün@@ chner north , it is estimated .
&quot; some of the children were certainly not optional . &quot;
many women were so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to say that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t get out , they need more accommodations only for them , calls for danger .
in Bavaria the seven bor@@ ou@@ re@@ ments for the housing of refugees shall be responsible .
on the question whether or not they know from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction area , some answer some with no .
there is such a thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in accommodations among the governments not .
even in Schw@@ aben , alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common accommodation units or house houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Dutch , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that has been published for the committee is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks the privacy or become involved in men and women , it may be - on @-@ going violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
as very the women of this aff@@ li@@ ction sense , one can aw@@ rang up to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has spoken , we have a long qu@@ eue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily do a second house .
assistant included : requests for new working conditions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ uty chairman of the assistant have called her union to appro@@ ve new working conditions in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( b@@ ma ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that government would have failed to address the concerns of the contract .
assistant and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ alities have been agreed in July concerning the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the b@@ ma .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was posted on Twitter on Thursday evening , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that the government was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ sever@@ ely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to problems which resulted in the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of which the J@@ DC Board has been aligned with the proposed new contract to reject and claim official new negotiations on all emails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has provided a formal request for a special meeting of the b@@ ma , in order to appro@@ ve a run program of escal@@ ating labour oil , which begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to that assistant of this year was sixth , the first full @-@ cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the b@@ ma Assist@@ enz@@ eller Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to reject the agreed subject conditions that had been recommended by the b@@ ma .
he shared b@@ ma members during the sessions that still took before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and be accepted .
following the vote said of the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of doctors in England would rather be introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Allianz of foreigners &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure which ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end to the eight months @-@ long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in receipt , I cannot refuse the expression of expression that Ankara wants to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles ri@@ cher and it is hardly any heat made up , even for its cau@@ ti@@ ous conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan he repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report full of five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never happen .
his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite to me .
but one of Putin out @-@ ray , lasting cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had nothing forgotten .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes : the dow@@ ning of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow from response to time was w@@ aged .
Putin shared and accused Ankara , Russia to be back in the back .
leaving was even bigger , since it was committed by an alle@@ ged friend .
building up again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long led the state @-@ controlled media a fier@@ ce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would have to blame for everything .
in the serious alleg@@ ations , the alleg@@ ations of conduc@@ tors were that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas Syri@@ za , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has argu@@ ed this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was accepted by the President Erdo@@ gan the Ent@@ schul@@ digung he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear on hand .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily required for all friends who can get after it last month at a failed state coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repet@@ itive terror attack on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are recorded again .
you are counting on a delay of the Mediterranean Sea .
this week prog@@ no@@ stic the state TV , cheap fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agriculture will be re @-@ imported .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti @-@ shaped it as follows : &quot; tourists staying there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West as it &apos;s reaction to the attempted power of power considered a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ongoing Gro@@ ll on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin des@@ pi@@ red to benefit from cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus that he sought after the failed state support for the elected government .
this is well known for Moscow as a matter of course , that itself has a profound fear of reg@@ im@@ e@@ pers .
the summit in this gl@@ oss@@ ary palace made it possible to Russia and Turkey , one as it was once described as anal@@ ysts once described , &quot; alliance of external out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that come from the West and are being treated badly and cont@@ ex@@ ed themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still great differences .
the greatest difference between Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support antagon@@ istic sites .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours in preliminary talks both President on the press conference said that they didn &apos;t even grasp the subject .
the President of Turkey re@@ mi@@ ed it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months more open host@@ il@@ ities - and in view of the potenti@@ als for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO @-@ member Turkey won the Russian figh@@ ter jet , it certainly is better that the two leaders at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the head of the R@@ BS brand , the R@@ BS brand must be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the head office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the bank has since stand@@ off@@ ended since it nearly had to be saved and saved almost eight years ago .
at this time brand str@@ at@@ ulas &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end @-@ fuel brands .
it supported international sports with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ing sponsor@@ ing the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to the Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be only available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all r@@ s@@ b references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange for nat@@ West change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer @-@ business which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a meeting tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand r@@ s@@ b will become our investor mar@@ ke and the brand , under which our employees are employed because we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but to pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these trademarks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely and our employees are working with the customer under these brands .
R@@ BS has already told that the Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer continue , and that it will increase the icing of the different brands in its Sport @-@ sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of the brands , for how do we focus in the interior ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief manager .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal ago three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can make these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

I am very emotional , because my family is here too .
I am very happy that it happened to New@@ market , because I &apos;m laugh@@ ed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the itch on , when he took victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacles - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the reti@@ red 20 @-@ painting winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a recru@@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ bot , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ ner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , reaching a few in front of him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that diff@@ ers it from the others in the weight control room .

three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive character@@ ful strength to beat his doub@@ ters and return to his ordering form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his or her at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin feu@@ ds Stab@@ at Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ ant his staff of Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the narrow trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old appointed for the Special Representative for the Environment and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without st@@ ating reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as the chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was since 2012 Ivan@@ ov &apos;s dep@@ uty , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his conclusion on the renowned state of Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( upon Russian ) that he had later been the executive director of the government director of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as a state of state on law enforcement and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin asked the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked about to leave his job and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious w@@ oven .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest ties of Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as a staff of staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television it claimed both men that the St@@ ef head had res@@ umed on their own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently no one .
but the official statement - that a man who once was formerly known as a potentially president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - st@@ ain on great sc@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin , being quot@@ ed on the website of the Krem@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to trust me this very complicated post - you could say almost - compl@@ aining about four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post of December 2011 .
before , he was dep@@ uty prime minister and defense ministers .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a member of the Public Safety Services .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the B@@ und@@ essi@@ ch@@ erh@@ us@@ ement ( FS@@ B ) , he replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his representative .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third presidential coup against the constitution .
but this post was taken from another , nearby allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was elected President , before he was elected president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion standard project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have joined the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge can now be connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four lock@@ ings of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ aque &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is opening up to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 obli@@ que .
the £ 1,35 billion standard project should be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of the Keit@@ h Brown , the construction site today had a visit and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering with a truly ep@@ ic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that have been used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the Br@@ ück@@ ent@@ ck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the pas@@ ing .
overall , almost 79 % of the entire Br@@ ück@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks , today in Ros@@ y@@ th place a beg@@ g@@ uss for the deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first install@@ ment is a significant milestone in every Br@@ ück@@ en@@ projekt .
with this fantastic project , the flow of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ precision and deep @-@ building represents .
after installation of the last road cut , and its connection to the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by pul@@ ling the northern fe@@ eder @-@ bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct 222 meters long is , approx . 6,000 tonnes weighs and at a slope of approx . 3 % to be drawn up .
dear , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works out , tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky yet to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat from Angl@@ ais . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI bail@@ out station took place on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after one crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat was turned near and placed us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds the boat already knew by their reach , until we left the water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ man boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at an boats with no life@@ jacket .
they arrived all abo@@ ard the part of the coastal flow and were brought back to the bail@@ out station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck unhappy and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine had a stop@@ over , however , this spar@@ ked itself in the ken@@ ing of the Bo@@ ots by the person rid of the boat .
someone has awak@@ ened today about these men .
badly hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly hurt .
as the police returned yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead the in@@ cis@@ ion of non @-@ alcoholic beverages is the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
when this came into the apartment he returned twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old became hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could take the cul@@ pr@@ its .
during the 50 @-@ year the clothes of his ex @-@ lady destroyed , he called his mother .
these al@@ arms dar@@ ed as a result of his sister .
together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that &apos;s why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the ex @-@ marriage of the man .
when the two women mar@@ ry the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year old his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ friend .
who builds Donald &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Party : investors will continue to be much stronger in the future in future .
how does one react to bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick in the next few years will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD hits a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next R@@ ats@@ ung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , argument is programm@@ ed .
first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a provision is lacking so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD &apos;s presi@@ dents Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build up to urban areas now has 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the city hall is , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as as as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal residential construction programme , which will cost millions and still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants to get tough@@ ness for investors .
regardless of this , so Brat@@ mann , b@@ ane , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the market @-@ market .
if the action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the program is not entirely clear : the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will run within the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
in order to prevent this , as the plan@@ ni@@ ol@@ itic Spre@@ cher@@ in Nicole Palm , should now be b@@ apti@@ zed out of the city now .
furthermore , we would have to re @-@ thought to pick up apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the west town .
at one fell sw@@ oop the problem can solve .
for in the West town , the end of the year are coming from .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : this will not want the owners , the housing corporations .
because the number of social housing is dramatically increased in the west town , one gets away from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak weak in a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cargo @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teenagers and child are no longer home to play outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on scre@@ ens , scre@@ ened in the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and be more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then on video games , and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters which initially create for the video games in the 1990s ( later , a string series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena of the population , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand were slightly from the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon had better users as a ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go out with their smartphones and are looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which are following with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screens@@ hot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the US the game led to a considerable increase in steps which returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.@@ 000 users recently investigated that within two days of launch of the game , the number of people followed by people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company don &apos;t know who plays from Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for the enhancement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring and who come from people who look &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sport can not be re@@ assessed .
who drives regularly sport is reduced its chances to mit@@ ig@@ ate cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in proper control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun .
consequently , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close to hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also the Sty@@ rian playsite , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its stim@@ ulus and the use will be made with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ites are combined in the real world and thereby are helping many people on hunting , active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the bond@@ age
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone L@@ it is on all the immense .
dynam@@ ically on the spr@@ int .
ef@@ fort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on gan@@ ese line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ campaign im@@ plant and enlarged the gap between yourself and the rest of the world before all eyes , under the light @-@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in the silver med@@ alli@@ en@@ sp@@ inner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ik@@ sk@@ sm@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ act@@ ress Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americ@@ an@@ ists of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the pig feeding during the Olympic Games during the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ osex@@ ual American writer , who wins a multi @-@ campaign im@@ plant and carries a total of the fifth , while she has established its reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long trip in this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of its sport@@ s@@ ways - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ an from 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I ever saw . &quot;
it was expecting a last test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not return with a handful of Gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as a disappointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after each of the women &apos;s gold and silver in the sol@@ vent in the art during the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won
Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first med@@ al on Tuesday , while she reti@@ red up at the f@@ are@@ well party of Mann@@ y@@ sko@@ ordin@@ ator@@ in Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as blan@@ ks .
although Bil@@ es existed , during its long avenue to the top , never to have the future planned , this is not true .
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside of the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl who has adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was also adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school@@ ing in the gymn@@ ast@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , was in force .
it has been no longer any multi @-@ way competition since the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last for as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina led easily through two fil@@ ings , the picture tri@@ umph@@ ed .
pig @-@ beams and bo@@ iling - in which bil@@ ites the world @-@ master@@ ing holds - lau@@ ded .
she finished again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 in the float again - and sat with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when they were expecting their En@@ der@@ g@@ ary - a pure form@@ ality - and tears away on Bil@@ es sh@@ iny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner when the vision they were once described in their collection @-@ book that was reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze wa@@ ist in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Mann@@ ing capacity , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their soil exercise , they cast to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared to be dou@@ bt@@ ful .
what it affects , so that the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims in mass fall in the car sho@@ re@@ ed in the car
according to police reporting that were released on Thursday , two women and an 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the k@@ ast@@ ern@@ most attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while they stopped playing in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 when the car was par@@ ked in a passage , said the authorities .
the k@@ iller cra@@ fted eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police shared that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker could not took the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of an adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings made the investig@@ ator to become a closer look to whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , predomin@@ antly in His@@ panic settlements during four months had been killed in nine attacks by seven people and two others wo@@ unded .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , divided Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed from the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized after their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah , died on site .
a witness to the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting range , which took on an empty Pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and safer a sphere from the seat as well as pu@@ frag@@ ments from the engine room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his antiqu@@ ity has found Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the outcome of a genetic fault , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during her pregnancy did nothing .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I managed not .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let me know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true -- of course one has left for it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her husband told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institu@@ tion@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a help@@ desk .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor scr@@ at@@ ched to his third year . he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he likes to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something against &quot; thought out . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language by , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those with Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of a unlikely future .
I constantly asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been asked for the progn@@ osis for a long time because I &apos;m not expecting them to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eless rating for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ inf@@ alls , flo@@ ods gives rise to rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
severe ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in Louis@@ iana forced the govern@@ or to call on Friday the emergency . it will be reck@@ oned all Saturday with more rainy days .
numerous streams in the southeast of Louis@@ iana and the south of the br@@ amo@@ is flood@@ ed its banks and flo@@ ods with large @-@ scale flo@@ ods , in extreme rainy , reported the National Wetter@@ dienst .
the govern@@ or of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards concluded that citi@@ zenship in constant contact with local authorities are already on the road .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand Sand@@ acks would have requested .
a flood@@ ing system is used over a wide range of parts in the south of Louis@@ iana to Saturday .
the weather service permits that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches would fall to rain .
on Friday a fleet of breakfast was used on Friday , while it continues to reg@@ ress mobile in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near D@@ enh@@ am Springs , both in Louis@@ iana , are all probability to reach the weekend of record .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood@@ ed many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a current flood@@ ing flood@@ ing into Ascension is a danger , since they are flowing only slowly into the Lake M@@ rep@@ as .
the river ticket v@@ v , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached on Friday already at 0@@ 9.00 am the highest level that was ever recorded .
rescue ste@@ ams still cl@@ apped people from the rivers in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots found themselves among those who were saved on Friday in the proximity of Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which usually lies more than 400 feet away from his house , overnight strongly in a night .
he said that he would have warned him another step @-@ man , who would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awake and the water flowing and flowing in &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it got my wa@@ ist .
his wife said M@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had such a stron@@ gh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all of the handic@@ apped and he could swim .
Hans@@ ford told that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ house in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood@@ ing &quot; had quickly spread quickly , as there were still serious ra@@ inf@@ all , and that the authorities ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ acu@@ ation .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer turned near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground through the ra@@ inf@@ alls has been significantly completed since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that severe ra@@ inf@@ alls and street flo@@ ods the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching waste in five minutes .
the C@@ BS subsidiary EM@@ L reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flood@@ ed houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flood@@ ed now .
the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the cities Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond have been decorated to accom@@ od@@ ate the ev@@ acu@@ ation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were provided almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets due to Hoch@@ wasser@@ s and sand@@ bags for the residents of the tak@@ eover , which hope to hold the water out of their homes and stores .
&quot; the last great flood@@ ing that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Munici@@ pal Author@@ ities .
this seems to be a similar occurrence .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls , &quot; survi@@ ving sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy in Philadelphia was shot , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia than Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown has suffered several shot , including in the lo@@ wering , legs , arm and tum@@ my , but that he was in his transportation to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot just believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified in a hospital as critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boys of the boys divided the channel with that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot to German@@ town .
likewise there were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found at the fore@@ front of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , found to be found , reported the station .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police find themselves whether under one of the last men of the offen@@ ders there might be .
subjects shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with , that it seems to come into a cross@@ fire between several Sag@@ itt@@ arius .
pat@@ ron@@ age sle@@ eves for storm @-@ barrel , which were trac@@ ed to various assault ri@@ ds , flood@@ ed the Tat@@ ort .
it seems that this is clearly to have acted in a continual battle .
on the road , on both sides of the road , we found it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so here it seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police skin @-@ man Anthony Gin@@ aldi with the Sender &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles made in the area .
there was no celebrations , and the police are checking with reports published , according to the monitoring video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it is reco@@ vering from the police and still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I put in the gymn@@ ast@@ ores in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been there for 1984 at any summer seas@@ ade and the US have never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone L@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie , Her@@ nan@@ dez , which were inspired to many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din ist and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics , is complete , makes every proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has established the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of these sports .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ ves was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was celeb@@ rating a surprise Olympics and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World@@ championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it unexpected , nevertheless master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ics routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , heter@@ osex@@ ual American writer , who won a single multi @-@ election event for women Gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witn@@ essing the top of these sports , but such results are not visible throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie be@@ es all the same route as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team .
they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics are only four gymn@@ ast within the team . it &apos;s also the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ ns is a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily staying in private trainers who are maintained by parents , which are intended for training , classi@@ fieds , competitive , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list is able to continue .
the majority of these turn@@ outs lie in a wealthy suburbs who can support the business .
in these verses , the gymn@@ asts given its entire training and that is for the families a most expensive and long @-@ term engagement .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone L@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tur@@ fs .
we must be inspired to the municipalities to numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easily accessible gym .
I have founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
during my meetings we have free and affordable turbines in Harlem for about 15.000 urb@@ ane juven@@ iles ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) offered and national and international winners .
in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) , to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that deserve to learn and benefit from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination to the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for the education and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this crew , who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to take part in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team and thank you that motiv@@ ates her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organise further strikes , after they rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts proposal
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 000 assist@@ ants who voted in a election bor@@ rowed him .
in July the plans revealed the plans to re @-@ introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and any further delay for the staff and patients .
the first assist@@ ants are intended to receive a new contract that contains changes to night@@ - and weekends work to improve care of od@@ ast@@ ical movements .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the b@@ ma comm@@ itt@@ ee for assist@@ ants informed last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have proposed the proposed treaty , in particular that it is the current availability of employees and administ@@ ering it , all doctors have to do justice . &quot;
at only eight weeks that remain even until the first group of doctors under the new contract shall be made , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts by the b@@ ma to find disputes on resol@@ ving disputes with government on re@@ vocation and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to the promise made by Jerem@@ y Hunt last month , that his door would always be revealed .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act , lift spirits and concerns the concerns of the assistant . &quot;
should he not do so , so did the assistant have made clear that they are prepared to perform other working conditions .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine sur@@ geri@@ es and 100,000 Termin@@ ales , since nur@@ ses and pract@@ ition@@ ers were included in order to give doctors on the strike post@@ ure .
the Ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes through an assumption of the reform of the British Medical Association .
the b@@ ma wants to make a better week@@ day re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants that will be subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , called for the assistant to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working conditions do not reach anything but little , but already bur@@ dened teams and service providers , and prepare the patients , priests and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the comm@@ itt@@ ee of the assistant and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries to respond positively to concerns about the pre@@ m@@ und@@ ancy and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as discharge , flexibility for training , training and education , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ culum , training and the gender Ministry for Education , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the b@@ ma in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of cardi@@ ac substances are benef@@ ited from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug depending on the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug @-@ mounted drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart inf@@ lo@@ wer@@ ed for people with a disease of disease .
the medication is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke and a further heart attack .
the NI@@ CE DE@@ N@@ HS regulatory requirements has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the NI@@ CE DE@@ N@@ HS regulatory requirements has been recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
approximately 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart inf@@ lo@@ wer@@ ed and stroke are caused by cont@@ ex@@ ations fet@@ ish material in the arter@@ ies .
if the bel@@ ag breaks , it can cause a cl@@ ots , caused the flow of blood to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack .
when the blood sugar has been solved , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ ve the flow of blood for the brain , which caused a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack at a higher risk are subject to another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of cl@@ ots un@@ likely .
the stimulation of NI@@ CE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the NI@@ CE health prevention Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or a stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attack and stroke inci@@ dents among people who already had a heart attack .
through a pro@@ visional recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the ble@@ eding risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the cor@@ par@@ ation is recommended for treatment that passes over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ u@@ ine leaves choice in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report , because of corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ a has led to that far @-@ spread ri@@ ms in Muslim communities is ignor@@ ant and ignored such as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cab@@ inet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headed by Sir Eric Pic@@ kles inv@@ ade the police , constitu@@ ents and Rath@@ eh@@ ouses to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ bs and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Kommun@@ al@@ Government , who now is a fore@@ igner from religious motives , said that the police should be permitted to protect Ab@@ sper@@ ms outside of voting machines to protect cre@@ ased voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a reference to themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er must merely call its name and address .
the report proposes not to spread remot@@ ely ink on the finger of a person if they give author@@ itative voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to charitable and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves not only against election was , but is also intended to protect the communist government in front of the broader corruption and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finance culture &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special course decided that the am@@ acting Mayor Lut@@ on , was to be included in the corrupt and illegal practices of his Am@@ anda .
the Court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ si@@ sted the religious feelings of his Muslim Community &quot; on Cypri@@ ot way , &quot; and that he would have brought his critics with r@@ attle stones and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ous duty of Muslims , choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person cho@@ oses one another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he vo@@ iced in particular al@@ arm@@ ing to fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent letters - when the older members of the Muslim Community has made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to s@@ ni@@ b the voting system , including the fe@@ eder of out to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as evidence has been attached to which pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in particular according to the will of the El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pak@@ istan@@ is or ban@@ en@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; super@@ ficial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have ignored the eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to s@@ ni@@ ers the system including the pro@@ hibition that political activists may edit , in order to stop &quot; election . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration testing , in order to prevent that the electoral directory has been used for immigrants and welfare purposes .
consider elec@@ tor@@ ate voters in front of the choice of your reference to question .
not removed ink on the finger of a person once they made her voice to prevent that someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic review on the nation@@ ality of a person conduct to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on requests to an automatic letter .
pro@@ hibition that political activists are full of complete letters and re@@ moves from letters to elections .
the police force the authority to set up to@@ ons around electoral gy@@ ms .
a draft law which is facilit@@ ated by an indic@@ t@@ ment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the re@@ pres@@ et of the People Act 1983 ( census of 1983 ) .
phot@@ oc@@ ating bot in bal@@ ms .
request that only English should be used in the election stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that employees generally en@@ force that voters do not go into the vote .
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no accus@@ ation was placed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has expressed Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the corrupt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lithu@@ anian and illegal practices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was sufficiently recognized for a number of reasons , according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eff@@ lu@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the constitu@@ encies of the Town H@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tri@@ sur@@ ge in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a signal signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is known as the mother of parli@@ aments , a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral blo@@ ams and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to wor@@ sen the situation , mu@@ stered her , as she saw in it , she moved out and laid it back into the shelf .
they continued on and tried four pairs of h@@ oses in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who found himself at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the selling area , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants out of the Aus@@ lage , moved their own stra@@ ights and p@@ ants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there to che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone turned , when they extended the under@@ p@@ ants who obviously did not like her , since they put them into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that you fell un@@ covered , and passed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone is watching or think about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants who tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; How contradic@@ ted to think that somebody would take shelter and who were not washed away . &quot;

Ms Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I joined , the staff are trying to pull the clothes pieces from the sale , after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and find out that another woman had it and went out and they were not washed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

if you look at your back@@ side then you should turn out to be the worst , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the fire@@ line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
gra@@ b the weapon between your fore@@ arm and your shoulder , before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the dead and twi@@ sting you , while the att@@ acker is cr@@ ush before sor@@ row , the weapon from its hands . hit him with the running into the face and move back@@ wards while they set the weapon on him .
when att@@ ackers , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the rail line , take the gun and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
now move the weight on the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before it moves back@@ wards and set the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ ar@@ chi .
but remember that it is at a smoking at the saf@@ est , your money is excessive - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
itiner@@ ant Ian W@@ right che@@ et@@ ched for a guide @-@ book his tongue on the most dirty places of Europe
a British passport under@@ min@@ ed its immune system and lit@@ igation of a serious investigation - by taking some of the most dirty and ec@@ el@@ dest places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and tou@@ ch@@ tor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sch@@ ab@@ ed his course on a euro bill , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resi@@ li@@ bility of his immune system .
in front of the le@@ aks of each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer for himself and to show us what he is going to let itself .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light .
the thought to rec@@ ede the dish@@ kno@@ b of a train toil@@ ette , which was already used by thousands of others , may seem completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually reside in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria .
Mr. W@@ right through Europe talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria , as well as his own health .
fortunately , none of them left its spec@@ kl@@ ed , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resi@@ li@@ bility of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate a peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public transportation to railway stations up to dishwasher code , the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample
in the movie he told me , &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he did justice to his reputation .
the only thing he turns , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its line @-@ line showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric number of over 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ res amounts to only less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to rec@@ ede , after its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric number over 4000 units was , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what I have to be in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will have nothing here , because it is inside the inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company has Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which includes both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of bow@@ el bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , ju@@ ices and New Categories Niko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something which is fascinating to look at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings so that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Make us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you claim that the interest in gut health is going to become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me have lost me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , which I have instruc@@ ted to s@@ lick it , like the ec@@ ol@@ ous Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course , there were things which it was easier to bring Ian to sk@@ ate it and others with which this was rather difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey from 2015 associ@@ ated 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us in particular with the wellbeing of stomach and intest@@ inal and 58 per cent said that they are using at least occasionally products used to include l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family demol@@ ishes Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ol@@ ster@@ y in Salt@@ usi@@ o , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ och@@ zi@@ ale family left her welfare , after a delay in the amount of £ 5@@ 0,000 because they wre@@ cked their neighbors .
Tanya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in Salt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they have been viol@@ ently removed from their property , sho@@ cked ana@@ esth@@ esia were property in a ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls @-@ made holes on , wooden holes were ri@@ pped , gar@@ bage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family were surrounded and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house@@ administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that they feared that the dwelling no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider when this property is probably regarded as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is mountainous and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who in the meantime had been living in the apartment and the police said that the terror which the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted , tr@@ aps with bas@@ eb@@ es , inti@@ mid@@ ation , drug dealers , and over@@ even scre@@ ens , spreading and flo@@ cks .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ ci@@ y behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be demol@@ ished under certain conditions , old gar@@ bage was found .
there were lo@@ vel@@ ed in the estate , which were trad@@ ed in the past in the past , the wood@@ cra@@ ftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said they had to fight on the streets and regularly called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall Housing lasted for her and her partner this week by the estate , after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were praised by facilit@@ ated neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so calm here - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patrick , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it failed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house , to which the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ flowing side of the common house , gar@@ bage and old toys have been hin@@ dered .
he added : &quot; it &apos;s a shame that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of her family , because a del@@ o@@ y is always the last step is the Corn@@ wall Housing into consideration .
it was a very difficult case since the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds have had to be dre@@ aming for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the congreg@@ ation that have been cour@@ ageous upon us and have made us the information to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will sp@@ ade a few neighbors , and the message is taught that ant@@ iso@@ ci@@ de behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patrick said that all three sons have lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirt mattress , which is step@@ ped back in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ y on the ground
workers of the property management are now having to gra@@ b the gar@@ bage dump , which surround the house
in 2014 the police led a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as le@@ agues , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having been guilty of the possession of a drug of class B into trade @-@ sight .
she said that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don be , who died in 2013 by an automobile accident .
after they were without shelter , it came out that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls of the house were graph@@ ed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will stop ten@@ ants that will not stick to the hous@@ eholder
Angela C@@ row adopted by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who don &apos;t adhere to the hous@@ eholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who can think of themselves without self @-@ dict@@ ations as well as those who were imposed by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ forms that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ al , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers that posted the videos about the dramatic Fly series in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall . &quot;

the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to bad visibility is slightly lower than usual , however , the air condition@@ ers insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .

the Catal@@ ans are coming in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , to the FC Sevilla , the back@@ game rises three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Double@@ sp@@ inner must do with the C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe @-@ League champion among others at N@@ ey@@ mar , which exc@@ ites the ol@@ ymp@@ ic football tournament with Brazil .
furthermore it is also missing Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter St@@ egen .

the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Str@@ egen , who has been compet@@ ed as number one in Barcelona for two years now .
coach Luis En@@ rique was disp@@ ens@@ ed to a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er st@@ egen in most of the remaining applic@@ ants .
in front of the first mandatory field of the new game , there is no doubt about the fitness centre of the crew , who was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia , on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. are not really convincing .
Sevilla once again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 @-@ defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , and stri@@ ves for the second tri@@ umph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona has so far been eleven successes of the record winner in this application .

this was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang on the record were left alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches at themselves .
they had with@@ drawn up on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their pul@@ ling in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sailors until now I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; had told c@@ rest .
after the Par@@ tie posi@@ um@@ ed Gold@@ - and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China Flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had to really fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
then , he determined the speed at the record and left Z@@ hang only as a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected match .
however , nonetheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking step@@ ping @-@ change to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the White @-@ rus@@ se had turned into its quarter @-@ final against the German Europ@@ am@@ eister Dimit@@ ri@@ char@@ ov , a re@@ ign@@ ant injury , was after that in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle &quot; with sheets .

Donald Tr@@ ump has had tremendous problems in an election campaign .
the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional con@@ serv@@ atives to post their majority .
President Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of its electoral campaign in the previous republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment , in which the usually large sp@@ uri@@ g and self @-@ reli@@ ed m@@ ultim@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns vo@@ iced how correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts expressed his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have enormous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
gu@@ ilt are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he took again his known media .
rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ can win@@ bur@@ ns sh@@ aky
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June to June , Tr@@ ump and his bank@@ ru@@ pt@@ cy of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ als .
other institutes do not appear at the front , although not by the distance , the candidates for Republi@@ can candidates are common in the federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a risk , Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump to the question , how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
and sch@@ ing behind , this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he make nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not rich for him at the end for the reasons of political correctness , be this in order , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to Press@@ Control , the party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened with funds to support its electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing , he should not present a better assessment values .
instead of what if the candidates of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans will attack the Congress more strongly among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ bun@@ al sc@@ am with d@@ oping @-@ test
the IO@@ C wants to address the event in the case of the IO@@ C .
Ken@@ ias Leicht@@ athle@@ tik threat@@ ens after the second d@@ oping affair during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a subject @-@ out attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee divided into the context of exam@@ ining an disciplines in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ y@@ lic functioning had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today co@@ aches , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a Ur@@ in @-@ rehear@@ sal under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I .
this is the team @-@ line Ken@@ ias had been reported by the d@@ oping @-@ Kont@@ rol@@ s .
the World association IAAF has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to rigor@@ ous own investigations , distributed a IAAF @-@ spokes@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IAAF has made an assessment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in a IAAF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and signed itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I , the rehear@@ sal were made and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p so@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ cred@@ itation of the athletes , who stood on the list for training checks in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was 2015 in Beijing F@@ WC @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 meters .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics of Michael Rot@@ i was de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should have informed against money @-@ money sport@@ s@@ men of his country about cont@@ agi@@ ous d@@ oping tests .
according to media reporting , he was said to have been arrested in Nairobi on his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya is at the IO@@ C in the number of d@@ oping under@@ go for a longer period of special observation .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C presented more than 2000 d@@ oping @-@ target controls before the Rio Olympics , it was advised to be taken especially athletes from Kenya and Russia .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functional control system .
the law was adopted just a few weeks before Olympia beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the episode , the W@@ ada Kenya took away from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight against the rules of the W@@ ada are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ets of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of television reports the ARD were repeatedly said that in Kenya D@@ oping means are readily available and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sport bet@@ s .
i@@ od@@ ine @-@ member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had provided them in the Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport surface area and systematic ged@@ opt was .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ ena@@ ers were excluded from the summer months as a result .

in Orch@@ ester@@ dig , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ ic conductor Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ med him .
we always say that they are very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really enjoyed amber music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Mar@@ oli plays an older ge@@ stu@@ d Mary .
she works with melan@@ chol@@ y to her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dance .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there is Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I feel Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I found as the Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of Lob@@ os for the operator : Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously normal man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
di@@ rigi@@ d is a necessity for him .
one sees it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
there is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , this is really important !

today we have visited the refugees , then the pu@@ ertor@@ ic@@ ans were gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want to .
they are the same themes and they are just as expres@@ sive as at that time .

&quot; those who don &apos;t miss and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the presidency of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kur@@ dish Community of Germany expects at short notice of ten thousand @-@ thousands of people from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of the harsh proceeding of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish Church is expecting a mass of weapons to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I reck@@ on with ten thousand times , in the medium term , with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already crossed over a few months ago with pun@@ itive actions , 500@@ ,000 Kurds within Turkey have been on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the ver@@ ified coup there are still sec@@ ular and op@@ positions of ethnic Tur@@ ks .
many will begin to start in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state which takes refugees themselves in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the p@@ endant l@@ ament@@ ed the targeted an@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arab , in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities .
in this way Erdo@@ gan wants to raise the ex@@ trav@@ eller upon the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenia and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president called for the German government to be &quot; sharp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany find a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan reviews . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also feared the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the burnt @-@ class as well as freight @-@ trailers , teachers and other academ@@ ics have the professional existence .
&quot; who@@ ever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan sits , sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ ists , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ oriented Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal for numbers of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks already reported the biggest group of the victims of political persecution in Germany in front of the coup .
on June 30 , this was 11.@@ 386 people and thus barely 29 per cent of all as the asylum justified ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , not against war , poverty or fu@@ tility .
asylum seek@@ ers according to the Basic Law are solely politically , so from state @-@ of @-@ state @-@ government , individually Ver@@ followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it w@@ eh@@ does &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get any of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia can not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern it is understood .
2021 will not come again at the end of the summer holidays right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
for bl@@ asts than before so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ elling struggle - this is ours .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the Elec@@ tions are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so do not allowed to choose the country day .
there are practical problems : in the holidays are assistant , the post@@ ers up@@ set , air ballo@@ ons infl@@ ated , fl@@ yers are distributed and ending voices , only lab@@ ev@@ oll .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and final Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern will once again pass on on the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
the hot phase if one can say this at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in surveys clear behind the CD@@ U .
thr@@ illing becomes how much N@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D ab@@ schnei@@ der and what remains at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ y aug@@ ust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes a nearly un@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents .
he travels through land , distributed , ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did before its legendary , Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , soul ering k@@ old feet get and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have step@@ ped up the rise of right @-@ wing , which is probably going to cost the good office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its cro@@ ch@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the interior of Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she has two times in ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel on grand@@ daughters ; Merkel Par@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ kreis lies in the Nor@@ theast Latvia .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lod@@ ged Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a p@@ ity also does not listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U are largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual electoral campaigns to market positions and above shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , such as co@@ ar@@ iness , play only an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the union has noticed that you have driven away the base in the country that it has to be very badly to find a Dragon into the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the countries of the country barely any .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election fought with its collabor@@ ators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go there , where people are w@@ eh@@ ous@@ ing , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every Bir@@ th@@ day party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering his SPD is now called for a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last recently with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just above the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD was still won by 35,@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , should bring the leap into the country day .
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holidays in need , and place their electoral campaign great @-@ we@@ dge to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online electoral campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the President Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green electoral campa@@ ign@@ ing on track search for native stim@@ uli by the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ ine , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the Mecklenburg &apos;s lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ San@@ ierung : immigrants from Sper@@ ling
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rolling , there is nothing to complain about .
to be responsible for those responsible for the developers , who start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only end up against the clock , there are all@@ ro@@ bs praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Tank@@ stelle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duc@@ tions .
the construction site was scheduled to be postpon@@ ed on weekends as scheduled to the south , until the end of October it all shall be ready .
praised will also be the ab@@ id@@ ing of the person responsible for the construction works , about when it comes to setting up @-@ making trips .
since the construction site went on Monday to the south and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , so that the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been restored , the traffic situation within the place has e@@ ased .
the citizens are now able to drive from kil@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 again .
the emig@@ rate through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was some partial complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the transport@@ ing management of the rehabilitation director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ lan@@ ger@@ strasse and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many v@@ eils are sought and rather restra@@ ined in their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that maneu@@ ver L@@ kw in residential areas ver@@ ste .
since the speed limit are not met , the municipality will increasingly send the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant over@@ taking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made themselves on location about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute has been car@@ ved .
the quick@@ est was with 77 kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has continued , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg , the road is now open again .
the maps are not allowed to look at the maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation with them has led to sales in sales , everybody has asked to look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some are more and some less concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for which has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Auto@@ haus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no light decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most vulnerable are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak house , formerly the crown , finds clear words .
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
not only him , but all the hosts have made it hard . &quot;
it failed customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy with every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue has risen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road @-@ rehabilitation have res@@ umed its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff was released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , the policy would have responded differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt has given us a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be financial compensation , with the reference , the hospitality , prof@@ iting from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages that result in renov@@ ations .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where so somewhat oppressed .
at all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the history of history .
that other tri@@ bal passengers are less often reserved because of the complicated traffic conditions so he can understand .
if one cannot drive , it is also elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the crises with B@@ SE and bir@@ thing , G@@ öh@@ ner will hold the impact of B 27 construction work on his clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced his restaurant in its many years of history .
six months of construction , that is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly in the name of the terrorist fight against laws is constantly being rob@@ bed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a th@@ icker safety package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ acy status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ al@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ onc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister for his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are asking for anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also , I participate in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the Minister of Finance , however , be on results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commercial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , it presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced , suggested that a new security office is to take care of the Kn@@ aking encryp@@ ted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany must put several EU guidelines for air passenger and arms rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities is not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second stop for proposals which has so far failed to make up with the SPD : he wants to put a sympath@@ iz@@ ist for counter @-@ groups under punishment and ji@@ ha@@ dists with double citi@@ zenship in the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ Mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he will nevertheless feel right for reasonable and demanding too , what is in case of co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers in any case any chances .
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
it is partly in itself : he is planning fast methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people from deport@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted at the country should disclose their smartphone , and reveal the social media account for a security check @-@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in D@@ ul@@ ings for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about such that commit crimes or make their papers consciously to wear their identity .
some of them is political and legally blessed .
some even un@@ aud@@ itors and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - does the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
ja , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between issues refugees and terror .
but it is not in speech , that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
in addition , many people were worried about the high refugee concern about safety .
and things that the people deeply occupied , were not closing down in election times .
the inner security is enormous when it comes to focus .
only the proposals in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD is therefore increasingly moving towards the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few days between the two parties went high .
only a gar@@ ish argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of the Federal Minister , in which the resent@@ ment will also be called a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition and a revers@@ al from the double citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able notes .
from a return of the double pass it is nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been the discussion in Germany and well @-@ paci@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ ap new , be not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka pro@@ hibition he did constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for co@@ al@@ ition@@ ers , it has to be seen until now .
there is a lot in what could be worried about contro@@ vers@@ y .
but the SPD is currently trying to as@@ sert itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ enk@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled with a talk to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even comes Volkswagen gli@@ de through .
despite Dies@@ el@@ sc@@ and@@ als rise the shipping numbers worldwide .
but not all markets are running around .
in case of recall , there is action around a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries to the second half of the months .
Europe &apos;s largest car builder in the previous year in spite of the Dies@@ el@@ aff@@ aires thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ moving markets continue to demonstrate .
but in July the core mar@@ ke VW went mainly in Western Europe and so hard to sell their sales , as in the D@@ ax not@@ ated companies .
worldwide , the brand has sold VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year of the year .
in Western Europe , in China alone , China is the second most important market , the sales of 14 percent in the year of the previous year .
in the home market Germany disp@@ at@@ ched the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost a Six@@ th .
Dr St@@ ack@@ mann has conducted the weak@@ est figures from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some key markets , it has been given back in some core markets , due to the altered economic framework .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um have also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the U.S. , where the bu@@ g@@ ments first escal@@ ated first , there is also further a minus to be@@ ech .
great feeding for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected h@@ emisph@@ ere of the Nieder@@ sachsen is continuing through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only a fix@@ ture from 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be be@@ ech .
on January until July Fred Kap@@ pler was able to show a sales point from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this period , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhau@@ st .
alone in Germany , VW approximately 2.5 million car calls for re @-@ equipment to the workshops .
in the course of conversion , VW , that the renovation of the cars had no negative effects .
after the re@@ armament of the vehicles there is no deteri@@ oration of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car maker set the customer after conversion a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certification , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it meant on Friday in a company name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons are legal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports , Volkswagen @-@ waters of its German customers now even a guarantee for embr@@ aced diesel models .
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Transport of Justice .
from the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that this meeting was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has completed the feed of my investig@@ ative commission and KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ in@@ ister Alexander Dobr@@ in@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to Ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor power after the re @-@ equipment does not take any deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it says in a company name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the extensive term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen offers the possibility that customers can come for instance , half a year after the refurb@@ ishment , approximately with a motor@@ bike in a workshop - and this could bring back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interests , it is important to avoid that in any case of any other damage , which at all have nothing to do with the ab@@ g@@ ass@@ ic sc@@ andal , to uncertainty as possible regarding possible warranty conditions , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Ischgl in the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ lake seeks to range from rich austerity in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ chef Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily monetary base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German federation of German banks refers to a single accident and does not see signal . ordinary sa@@ ils would have to fear not to pay for its spar@@ se prosec@@ ution . &quot;
bear@@ er banks money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay its 0,4 percent criminal law .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Ischgl from September of Privat@@ e- and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ cup accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 Euro in the year , &quot; said Paul .
he has been around 40 million euros , who could be lifted up from one day to another and that he could not commerci@@ alise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie for every million 4,000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will now continue the cost of the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash just lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four attack , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and are very rare in other systems .
only few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ oper@@ atives Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are alone to carry on , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating economic permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or over@@ rides .
with pun@@ itive in@@ soles on deposits of three million euros had made the Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Ischgl and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , Alten@@ burger Land with its sk@@ ate bank branch of 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect to pay private customers from over@@ hau@@ st for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks are far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped from the assets a little more l@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ b@@ anden and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had ended at the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold to go into neg@@ atives towards the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;

it is also not a hor@@ des through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ters retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a message report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a hum@@ ble dec@@ eption tr@@ age and wild ge@@ stu@@ ere before I stop my hands and tell something like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly running to its charm - Hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera to the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mix@@ es through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I followed by S@@ ister Ray ( Number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably about the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and passes through the stores to fill the few hours .
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have approximately 3.000 or 4,000 sheets .
these sil@@ ks , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not afford as they appeared and again bought objects that he sold when he was young and ple@@ aded .
&quot; many things I sell are from the late 1960s , early 70@@ ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was something too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es to those who are buying the plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend their own time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my case .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets he meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who have heard of the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and visu@@ alize , to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually have been sent to their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once bought their plates to buy CDs now buy their CDs to get back their plates , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to trailers of a particular age .
but what about the in@@ appropriate emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica to realize that records are a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some of the latest fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw himself to the stability of confidential sound spher@@ es , of objects , the happy youth @-@ deposits .
&quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of a void or poss@@ essions of material poss@@ essions than a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so with lots of people so much .
it is a simple way to be mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are an employee of a record @-@ stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they have not been heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who own a record , do not have turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I have flo@@ wer@@ ed with a stack in Bossa Nova Comp@@ ass .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( numbers : three men in middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; someone only came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ al plate , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening .
more product @-@ duty , less musi@@ kl@@ ast@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which will not come slowly .
F@@ op@@ p which has dedicated the sound boards almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I re@@ wind .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women of middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops is - Wild Be@@ asts new synth@@ esi@@ zer and sex@@ t@@ pack@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz , from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks especially lonely , but nag@@ ging psychological sor@@ mat@@ a are hard to adjustable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs in business for several minutes and looked at the variation of the plates available for sale .
it is more of a window ort@@ al than a large one .
they do not deserve much , so the collecting of records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or another , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it is driving with a dist@@ orted si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business from which it is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the appearance , the je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , observe a group of young teenagers , for a moment for Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and daughter to consider to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
nobody looks at them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it &apos;s impossible to put it into .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could give some customers in the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research announces that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and records , which exist in reality , records and in On@@ line@@ for@@ s .
these people probably work hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they ste@@ er the rigi@@ d view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 years old moder@@ ator , who has w@@ aged over the shoulders of anything middle age .
the Green@@ land Hotel is the longest living flu@@ al - video report
scientific say that Green@@ land@@ ai has the longest life span of all vert@@ eb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius Niel@@ sen , who studied shar@@ ks , says that the record was placed at a female , from which it came out that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rests with demol@@ ition from shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French dish has rejected a offering of the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , living in the thousands of refugees .
during a trial proceedings , the authorities argu@@ ed that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional business to those individuals within the camp of goods , of cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hairdres@@ sers services or sell for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Calais was argu@@ ed that these places should be dismant@@ led , because they would be a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and which will be a fire and rehabilitation risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important because the free meals that were offered by the state @-@ assisted association and other groups , do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they also went out that the pro@@ visional stores and restaurants have often been accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ visional business , but ad@@ mits that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais will be absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people feed to live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that were threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ eri@@ ous was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , was administ@@ rated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes and advice on asylum causes for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to preserve the kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it says that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , the recent eight years were old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two auxili@@ ary assistance Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Auberge des Mig@@ rants represent on Friday the number of who has risen in the jungle living on over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .
in spite of the Olympics : Martin does not remain milit@@ ant

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany . he must set itself up for the next generation of speed measurement : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new Flash devices are tested , the tem@@ a@@ ers are supposed to be particularly effective .
the fut@@ urist@@ ic eff@@ ected en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on in@@ genu@@ ity , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction , or to san@@ atorium bridges with temporary tem@@ per , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there are a stationary under@@ se@@ ater for keeping the speed limit .
but a lasting mobile structure can be too dangerous or elaborate .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is aut@@ ark : his battery comp@@ lies with un@@ interrupted measurement of five days , the fall@@ data is encryp@@ ted over a mo@@ dem .
with laser tools , all vehicles can also be captured along several tracks at the same time .
variable speeds as well as flow @-@ door after time , stri@@ ps and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the top @-@ driven state one can move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with any car with a to@@ w@@ bar .
so that he is not easy to cl@@ oned , it is lo@@ wer@@ ed in the test mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and inci@@ dentally will also disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should be protected against capitalism in front of destruction .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested for data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has dropped 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain wins silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold retri@@ eves
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finale on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in Rio .
Fi@@ ji is divided a master@@ class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , up@@ bringing , line @-@ run and ro@@ wer power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ad al of any color .
the defeat was ens@@ hr@@ ined by the not too bad Tro@@ phy of the silver med@@ al - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they swal@@ lows in New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back in the finale .
but whatever of it could have been a 15 @-@ man team in existence in this form .
it could be for GB a Tro@@ st - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al to have his neck . Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
it had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago , they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop is w@@ aking , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began admir@@ able and caused the attacks of GB@@ s from a lot of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co . , when one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went five @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes running time Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hard to set the ball .
a h@@ itting T@@ 550@@ von Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute l@@ ete J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner has a tou@@ ching down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ f@@ eit by more weak tactics of the UK teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to break .
it &apos;s so as if fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still inter@@ fer@@ red .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in basic amendments to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua ran away from Tu@@ is@@ ova following a brilliant intermediate play of fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for the UK , made a tou@@ ch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was running already long in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ican , whose fans s@@ angen , flags , and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing with another attempt in recent seconds .
the fl@@ air burst which fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ hing in the lawn .
formerly at the day Fi@@ ji Japan had conqu@@ ered in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 conqu@@ ered Great Britain in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the items in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , secure the gain - and thus the silver med@@ al .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer for rowing machine
there will be no escape gold than to play at these games and that wants what to say .
from the first stroke until the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who enter history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the Bei@@ den who sat at the Ru@@ ins , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as they were on the second of the Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row , followed by the first women in the history of the British Sports , who laid up such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 39.@@ ter un@@ trained commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins set about the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ umph@@ s to ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in the ruin , a batt@@ ali@@ on contribute to willing to make the difference and there was no one assistant than the coach , which would not survive 30 months ago , whether he would survive this day when they were diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had stomach cancer , who is operational and they did so .
if you do not , it spreads throughout .
it would have been a pretty little situation .
there is a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , off the season , could start what the inter@@ ruption kept to a minimum if that is the correct term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back more quickly .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
the rod itself is a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger .
in the infin@@ it@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve fir@@ ing morning with a little more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have wished for a better person or want a better co@@ aches .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important to not get pl@@ uck up .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to making some tolerance .
we didn &apos;t want to go to a fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result and win the race what we did too .
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adventure of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want my last race was .
this means a lot of pressure .
in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of pre @-@ exempl@@ ary for clarity made
the General Manager of the Wasser@@ zw@@ eck@@ verb@@ und &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; , R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , continues to retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ most &quot; . &quot;
a small fr@@ än@@ k@@ ischer drinking water @-@ linked set as an example for the large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original article in an article by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later was the water@@ forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken the T@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ hau@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ most is exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the T@@ eck@@ verband Partner , of which 28 years was as managing director .
now he was adopted in retirement at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , annually promoting around 15@@ 0,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
affiliates are the communities of Kirch@@ lau@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for further towns and villages , there are water delivery agreements .
the current Chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Ger@@ tru@@ de Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was established as water@@ fo@@ were and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ it@@ association in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extend from water @-@ building construction and maintenance activities , budget@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and fees until Emer@@ ging parag@@ rap@@ hs to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weekends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , real estate purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of the high @-@ container ( 1999 ) , creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the sub @-@ creation of water @-@ lines .
there have been no inter@@ ruption and I have always received improvements because water is be@@ ating and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised G@@ öl@@ ler &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of passion for his water@@ purpose association and he has also lived for the water@@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he as a real pract@@ itioner the success of the V@@ eit@@ ed group was allowed to present to the nit@@ rate of the bor@@ ough of Unter@@ fran@@ ken in front of the water forum .
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler &apos;s part of his part praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he described the well @-@ construction and the restructuring of the tw@@ ist association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were however the tube @-@ off at the High School at Kirch@@ lau@@ ter on 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all the night , so that the loc@@ alities can be supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can once only maintain , because you filled the flood from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who performs the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ eide ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they were fatal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called for himself and stated his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator be on the escape , after him will be publicly known .
meanwhile nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown , brown , and has a glass .
by now the police have published a picture of him .
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ ade .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he can still carry the weapon with himself so the police .
who Sven S. looks , should the 110 call .

at first the police in Lübeck , the police in Lübeck first wanted to make no information about the we@@ ather@@ age or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a man has been killed .
&quot; it is a k@@ ill@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for Deutsche St@@ ah@@ lindustrie
the rec@@ ycl@@ ed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed of additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that dro@@ pping the industry from the cost of net promotion , are from the table .
it ab@@ ide by the liberation of the Renewable Energy Reg@@ ular in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Zeitung Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fre@@ ag@@ erial award ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that after two years we were able to finally reach negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned , the steel manufacturer , the gases from the test@@ es to generate power generation for its own consumption , in order to register .
the steel industry shares additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , I now give a certificate in agreement with the EU Commission for talks with competitive comm@@ iss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only if the generators used in the steel plants , an E@@ EG accounts for 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission to self @-@ current production .
this will largely determine the status quo of the previous regulation .
particular importance has the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even on the reform of the em@@ ission policy , climate and employment targets are weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and significant pricing .
last year the situation continues further than the world &apos;s world @-@ largest automotive market has shi@@ fted steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European producers cast Chinese steel @-@ cutting price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
to the one hand , imports of import of import as well as the others have raised the economic prospects in China .
unclear how lasting the price is sustainable .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp was careful on Thursday .
last , the prices were rather st@@ agn@@ ant again .
the sector is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp only wanted to close out of individual works for the last time .
around 8@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry .
in July the German steel producer remain careful in spite of rising prices and growing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tons of good six percent less cru@@ de than the previous year @-@ year , as the economic unification is wed@@ ded to the Friday .
after a short increase in May the performed crowd went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , the production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , Health : sing is sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she had accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher studies , she defeated the fur of music , and now the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir .
&quot; singing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; describes her .
after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says .
at the same time , she is doing a good thing with her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives an amazing hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard p@@ ac@@ kler by the German Sen@@ iors .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes h@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular cont@@ ex@@ ts , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often , social and family structures emerge at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; align and organize themselves on the other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , mean h@@ ac@@ ke .
because they are practic@@ ing a deep and controlled breathing .
who@@ ever calls his lungs regularly , also in everyday life not as fast as the bu@@ ste .
even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
to older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz , says of the Federal Labour community of the Sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explained .
L@@ enz frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people awak@@ ened many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
inspired by lyrics and particularly mel@@ o@@ dies , people themselves d@@ ash@@ amed about long past events .
while singing , the head is also required for a special performance , declar@@ es the sequence .
at the same time to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
especially elderly who live alone , practice so not just to concentrate on yourself .
another positive aspect is recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I have long been for something , I will get better and watch@@ se beyond me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough .
who@@ ever wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you s@@ ings not s@@ ings alone - at 50 Sin@@ ful people who hear who sounds like a sound next to it ?
looking for the suitable offer sen@@ iors different possibilities , says h@@ ac@@ kler .
s@@ ings someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a senior choir , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer Over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church .
many sen@@ iors can be found also via the Internet .
if you have no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors will ask for help with the internet .
who wants to sing , should join in a choir , called h@@ ac@@ kler .
sing the soul well and has something fre@@ ading - this is true of any age .
cats react sensitive as sound at fri@@ ght of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover , which effect the ruin of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise the h@@ ew@@ ing also did not let the males do not cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always alike .
female cats are able to recognize the sof@@ tening of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the Mi@@ rows of the L@@ esser .
they are responding to ten percent faster on lu@@ te of kittens that are cho@@ oses in great distress as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the ruins of kittens - however always alike .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acou@@ st@@ ical differences between the co @-@ breaking of fewer and strong vir@@ ons for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H .
it is first author@@ it@@ ant in the study , which was published on this Friday in the Expert &quot; BMC Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous examination the research team had already found out that the duration and ton@@ ing of the kit@@ ties with the ur@@ gency of their aid is distinguished .
observed in total nine adult male and eight boxes out of the animal rights of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a hul@@ king of children who were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ens of stronger kittens , who were additionally raised up .
the researchers regard their results despite the small sample of rehear@@ sal for failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted in the fri@@ ght , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out faster to the speakers , when this ru@@ p has played a very rainy kit@@ ties .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the gender @-@ ri@@ pe .
&quot; a surprise was that males have responded to at all , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o .
in the past scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on bab@@ y@@ ways .
also some studies showed that ladies re@@ acted more sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Biolog@@ o in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pod@@ olski takes up with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey there was a ar@@ rest warran@@ t for the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r .
he will be accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is taking place once again an important football match . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ bish@@ ops between Col@@ ony Istanbul and Luke Pod@@ ol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line un@@ ambig@@ uous : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in the suspension of the suspension , after the crash test in July the government that should not be affected by norm@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this applies not to those who are suspected of being suspected of the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
it is also not easy before football .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r set up the prosec@@ ut@@ or a warran@@ t .
according to the meantime , a member of the terrorist group is now being pre@@ destined to be a member of the terrorist group .
South of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len must be responsible for the presi@@ dents Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
although , the trial is still regarded for 90 days until October , in fact that affects the lives of most Tur@@ ks but as well as no effects .
the night @-@ speaking &quot; democracy @-@ orph@@ ans &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for finished .
sport is - like the whole country - split into p@@ aces and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club members have traditionally been among the friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks but given the dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
that even itself the fans agree - whether you have strikes the heart of Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or to tour .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially walking back to Luke Pod@@ olski .
his sporting emphasis was demonstrated in Köl@@ ner during the expired season : with 17 T@@ res and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as a top@@ show of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ er@@ ffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an outstanding way and its team has secured the award .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; found the dis@@ appointing season for the record master a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the previous round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also in the European league will be made early .
in the south @-@ per Li@@ g it only seemed to rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to gain anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed and that is the most important &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Pod@@ olski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master visits the game was better .
mainly thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who laid out at 26 seed figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sch@@ ütz@@ en@@ nig , the base for the 14th song .
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of the AC Florence under contract , the G@@ ome@@ z had not been announced at once , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ Holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us he has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club Mr. F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the storms would have to do without re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish for about a third of his to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in Ath@@ le@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .

bom@@ ben@@ thos in Thailand - Ost@@ rei@@ cher@@ in viol@@ ates - Multi@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand represent with the woman in contact , told the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ ag@@ early .
they have suffered mis@@ ses and be treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
your home trip took her scheduled for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the vacations island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also have Austrian citizens , is not yet unclear .
the State Department stand in constant contact with local authorities , so Schn@@ öl@@ l .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok located Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a district of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in was killed and about 20 people have been viol@@ ated , including Austri@@ ans , three Germans , three d@@ ut@@ ches and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early then two jumps then went high , but according to the authorities another human being killed .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ b blast .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver became a taxi driver after the police information .
at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country explo@@ ded another bom@@ b , which k@@ ills an urban nur@@ se .
the offspring is according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ pot in front of the prec@@ inct @-@ coastal police in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the southeast coast several last .
from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b attacks carry the same manus@@ cript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said arm@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express themselves to possible mot@@ if@@ s - probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern during the attacks , that is typical for the bom@@ bing of bom@@ bing separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the th@@ ail@@ än@@ dische police declared the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok .
it is rather clear that bom@@ bs were laid down by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities have received secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but do not have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
still unknown , which group behind the attacks .
the police proved its officials in the whole country to increase security around important governmental buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
in Thailand it has repeatedly been smaller bom@@ ben@@ ches , but they usually do not direct up against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the conf@@ isc@@ ated bom@@ b , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at his homepage , the instructions of the Thai security authorities in a consequence .
high safety risks ( security level 3 ) praised for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by disputes between the security and Muslim population , there will be no necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the military j@@ unta .
the military has a big impact in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs were a try to sti@@ pul@@ ate chaos , while the country moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps the kingdom led again to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed , to get a grip on in the far south of the country in the far south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , Bangkok was killed in Bangkok to a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ eme 20 people - most of them are foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to the Vis@@ or of the federal state for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several countries , the Constitu@@ tional Court in the Bund defended the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ident@@ it@@ arian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitu@@ tional Court of Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are bl@@ amed in a extrem@@ ist way .
therefore , we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; identical movement &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ul@@ tural W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by superi@@ ority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional From nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieder@@ sachsen , Saxony and Thür@@ ingen - observe the &quot; identical &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely aligned with the rulers with the rulers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pick up their target audience , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extrem@@ ists attempt to address them with ju@@ gend@@ ger@@ genuine language , often with double music .
the Islam@@ ists are just like right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ ists .
this is not any question@@ able advertising for its own cause .
propaganda is supposed to address the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in special ways .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently it had given reports from several federal states reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; African politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for the Constitu@@ tional protection , possible contacts of this species are relevant only at some point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist to change its target device and become so extrem@@ ist .
thus , whether such people have a controlling influence over the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the marked increase of extreme cre@@ ased off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and Refu@@ gee arri@@ vals said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that another legal group@@ ings or small groups form to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against Refu@@ ling@@ sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other extreme far @-@ right mot@@ if@@ s .
but a German nation@@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups have ar@@ isen on the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
concerned , Ma@@ ate had expressed that many over@@ gri@@ ps were entered into the account of people who didn &apos;t enter their appearance before in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ j@@ ä@@ mer at attack on asylum seek@@ ers are not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated parties or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off@@ ences committed before with right @-@ wing extrem@@ ists who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or chosen for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but they have radic@@ alised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ cles or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics center , the slightly over@@ crowded swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures .
it simple - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a rel@@ ay of 48 seconds and won the 5th place of 59 Star@@ tern .
but it was rather his not just sport@@ y figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old do not participate in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start@@ up from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ trac@@ ted countries more well @-@ known .
as in ether , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes it ready for the big race .

Gf@@ K &apos;s leadership is in accordance with the dis@@ appointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K captured his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returns - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K allowed me to believe that the chair of pre @-@ ste@@ ef Matthias Hart@@ mann was all the more uncertain , the longer the success of him had failed .
turbul@@ ence at the hel@@ m of Nürn@@ berger market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appointing business figures and the re@@ sig@@ nation of the company management is the worldwide number five of the industry in front of a personalized service .
Gf@@ K @-@ board leader wants to leave the company by the end of the year .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the reason for the back , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to long @-@ term business alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call a business speaker on Friday .
who will be le@@ aning forward to the market research company , is still unclear .
in attorney &apos;s coun@@ ties it was on Friday , on the shareholders were most recently the disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring had grown up years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently poor Gf@@ K business , each ant@@ s@@ s@@ eig@@ ner will eventually become un@@ ser@@ ene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be in case of BMW , it would be the quot@@ ation as it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman with the police Au@@ rich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; she said .

the charges per cu@@ bic meters waste from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ al 3,@@ 44 instead of so far EUR 2,10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( so far 18 Euro ) .
at the system in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then further increase once again if appropriate measures will be necessary .
after a serious lim@@ estone , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf is then located at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported it was noted during the approval of the budget by the land of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems under@@ runs .
the market Kas@@ endorf is committed to the legal basis to operate facilities .
as of 1 October 2016 citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from world events , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ to , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg , must gra@@ b deeper into the w@@ allet .
the conduc@@ tors are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt the Panel was a re@@ mod@@ ulation of the fees necessary for the deport@@ ation of the market Church .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - and cover@@ ings out of the previous calendar period will be equal .
the engra@@ ving char@@ ching increase was made up by all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities , with a very low waste water , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution situation , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would affect gra@@ vi@@ ating .
moreover , the se@@ wage occur in all three plants is easy .
in the backward calendar period , the period of all three plants were not least due to their age , san@@ itation and repair periods in a significant extent .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world @-@ bath , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to a damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk World Cup , the nearly 20 year old F@@ Ö@@ R@@ DER@@ EL@@ LA@@ GEN had to be out@@ dated because of nearly 20 years operation of the first clar@@ ification of spon@@ ge , the clar@@ ification and an additional ventilation to be installed in order to even stick to the water legal sti@@ pul@@ ations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res came the advanced assistant and maintenance costs , which are to be considered according to the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calcul@@ ation period &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at previous lim@@ ulation in the years of 2011 / 2012 are still considerably below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that minor loss in the three plants allow for operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was comple@@ mented , comple@@ mentary Schmidt , the market community from large entertainment costs over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious in the duration of stone houses on the long period , especially since one could not extend the supply @-@ area of the waste water purpose of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ al to expand these plants because it is about de@@ ar@@ it@@ ational institutions .

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; -@@ effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature .
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is called An@@ ime @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bly towards breeds .
with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users , to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is bor@@ dered an absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure which might be of a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein &apos;s paintings .
the filters are int@@ rigu@@ ed , self @-@ twi@@ sted tools that produce more than 30 million enhanced sel@@ ects per day .
all the mal@@ tr@@ ations come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have moved in the past critic@@ isms in which they have been accused that the App Black@@ face would be convey@@ ed or white skin as beauty ideal .
when there were some users a filter for some U@@ sers , which gave them num@@ b , false teeth and aff@@ lic@@ ted wo@@ unded , there were some critics , a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; Gel@@ b@@ gesicht . &quot;
they asked whether this repet@@ itive contro@@ vers@@ y was referred to a larger problem that the company has with Di@@ versity .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat , that it would be disabled .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a tri@@ bute to An@@ ime characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders , the r@@ is@@ sm@@ us have experienced , rec@@ alled the filter at hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the An@@ ime @-@ comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et about the photos were widely used , that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and laugh@@ ing unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ assured , but that the Gel@@ b@@ face was drawn into the ab@@ omin@@ able Extre@@ m .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ h@@ te .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence and integration fight , from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great crowd of young people - who are in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ players - could expect more to expect sensiti@@ v@@ ities .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture created that for a user , it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ ress and Ingenieur@@ in for Medium , your Snap@@ chat account urged others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a phone interview , she said that they believe that racial ri@@ ver@@ ses are a lack of diversity among the settings of Snap@@ chat with Snap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critic@@ ized the most part white , only male leadership and ended up with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they do not have various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ese American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their mind , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat has mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any numbers on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday it got Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible , focused on sub@@ re@@ presented population groups and in internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u said that she will let her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not OK . &quot;
military governance , ISIS &apos; intelligence , provides the Committee of Congress
dairy union of the United States Central Command changed thought@@ ful information to record an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the actual states on site , a investig@@ ator committee referred to in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Executive Committee , secret services , and of the Wehr@@ budget Comm@@ ites , reported of great dis@@ content among Central Command secret services , reported on how pre @-@ ordin@@ ances expressed its ass@@ essm@@ ents to the US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military situations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news services , which were typically rep@@ lic@@ ated by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren in a regular basis , recorded a more positive image of the US efforts against terrorism as it would have enabled the actual stat@@ uses on the spot , and have been in@@ compar@@ ably more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened in Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , Ken Cal@@ ver@@ t , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the executive error in the Cent@@ Com are reaching as the top head of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report summar@@ ises detailed problems in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there is no direct evidence of fact that government tips given under Obama statements , shows how anal@@ ysts got exposed to their fore@@ laws , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , opinions and statements before Congress clearly states more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com attempts are publicly known that a military re @-@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress , from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the revised Group reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them that anal@@ ysts were concerned with regards to the mani@@ pulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
additionally , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the general law of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the message service provider on Thursday released their own findings , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com acquired a re @-@ restricted process for creating det@@ ri@@ mental evalu@@ ations to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the first @-@ day democr@@ at in the comm@@ itt@@ ee , member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ ps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; postpon@@ ed the publication of det@@ ri@@ mental reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ als among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over@@ ly little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats agreed to have no indications of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determined political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by the General Assembly of the Pentagon , which were received by the complaints of Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment reports of Congress , while the investigations of general inspec@@ tors still be still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of more complex data and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence did a contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of this important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigation has continued effects on the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orable estim@@ ations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis @-@ regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ que of the hearing about the Islamic State recall the dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the dam@@ aging government headed by George W. Bush on the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts only a small occupation forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after statement of government agencies , that contrary to the statements made by government air@@ strikes against the terrorist group would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries were taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commands , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win four thousand match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
one day after she had p@@ oured three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American F@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday to India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had not among the people who keep their goals in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ be@@ aten .
the United Kingdom and the United States will last on Saturday in the final play of the first lap .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group .
the first place will set the strong Dutch make a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may be going on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
it grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in hands ( their two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 , where she and her team came out everything .
in the next year , Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , leader of the team of national team and thus the things began to turn towards better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have a job in London that we now have .
we have the rest of which can pl@@ uck up .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the go@@ ings in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the clos@@ eness .
India had gone out in the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprising , and kept the game from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
it completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and finished the ball into the gate to get the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the p@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs that had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inevitable , a rapid season between competition and quest .
it is , as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic f@@ ack@@ el itself would have a burning st@@ oves that will protect from the w@@ rist@@ in@@ let to swi@@ mm@@ ers to the tur@@ ner of the tri@@ athlon .
you can not turn off the television to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in qu@@ eu@@ es in the coffee shop , without via Simone L@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
do@@ ol@@ ey which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female s@@ warm with gr@@ ins , could well have been sent among these known names , built up to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ sensitive advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fiction .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ oline for gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame is not illumin@@ ated any event identical .
further from the center , partly in the shade there are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it rule for long .
but if I could make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me direct the attention on the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline already has been an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event , when it had in Sydney his debut , it has been noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ type at all .
this might also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the U.S. Ath@@ l@@ eten sent to competition , there has never been a med@@ al jump in the tramp@@ oline , and until 2012 has had an ath@@ l@@ ete which has made it up to the du@@ dr@@ unde .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for women .
Dong Bell from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold med@@ al from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ resolved ear school for a c@@ low@@ ns@@ schule than those for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never per@@ ish specim@@ en - but also the Grazie of the gym and pi@@ geon containing two sports which it combines essentially .
the word &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging Sieger jump on a giant tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to cross a number of falling movements ( turning , rear and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they will be assessed according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram to the execution of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ made athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are together in Rio against each other .
the common ol@@ ymp@@ ic vector is straight .
medals must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up@@ wards and dr@@ au@@ ght , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , up@@ wards and down on the playground .
not only do you chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the Initi@@ al wall , but also in the TV transmission : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord .
the purpos@@ eful pursuit is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to get even a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel when looking at these games as something would be ti@@ ring .
this re@@ bo@@ under offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a Pre@@ war@@ dly movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go up , then down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no sore point in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant case of time and gravity .
it is such Zen how the competition can be only on the Olympic Games .
the qualification and En@@ dr@@ unden of women will be held on Friday afternoon , Stream@@ ing at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC is radi@@ ating the du@@ cks as part of a afternoon blo@@ c on both days starting from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked this in the general tum@@ ult .
when the awareness au@@ ction can only be achieved through the att@@ aching and the lens of male athletes , as it was the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal , then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expected his to air rin@@ se , new fan@@ fare .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the USA
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia , enjoy violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that the demonstr@@ ators were killed during the bre@@ aches of the police during she@@ ep@@ herds .
is Ethiopia just to come together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ag@@ greg@@ ated of the West with a fast growing economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months &apos;s protest against the government has risen in more and more territories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and called fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was rel@@ ap@@ le@@ ci@@ ful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave that polic@@ emen were shot down on zig un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
yourself in the con@@ centric run videos about protests , pres@@ um@@ ably from the last or beginning of this year , how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the leader of the UN authority for human rights is now calling an in@@ coming examination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , get as much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dra@@ stically - there is a new swing in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , the dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively brought to silence .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or in the times of the desert .
yet this could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiop@@ ian .
the entire youth Protest@@ ant .
a generation Protest@@ ant .
there are numerous gri@@ ev@@ ances that cover anything from the ground @-@ use up to the stran@@ gling in relation to the power of the governed coalition .
after a secondary election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for this z@@ acked , controversial line in June hundreds of lives .
anal@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden have been imposed more or less on the past few years , protecting turbul@@ ences and re@@ armament themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of Ver@@ bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of surrender to the surface is now explo@@ ding .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media , because cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing in regular intervals , most importantly in protests , many people can still communicate over Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies which conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they gathered so to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons of prosper@@ ous , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ether , predomin@@ antly in Christian high @-@ countries , in politics and economics , while they explo@@ res the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims live and live in flat areas .
but also this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests occurred in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who domin@@ ates around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the Secret Services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion , was to his death on a publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiop@@ ian prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tic genius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in using early signs of dis@@ content and to use special officers in order to edit opponents and make it in@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ian of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relative for reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the controlled security services rendered by the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was created such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed , according to the statements of analy@@ st seem to be fu@@ elled from the government and subsequently stolen .
during the following swe@@ eps many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it had been less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest was relatively fast over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development of development experts , Ethiop@@ ian Ethiopia and leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new swing @-@ head , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in the fight against poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ appearance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous form of ethnic form .
last month of the protest movement in gon@@ dar , an am@@ or@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ guided shops and the hate against the Tig@@ ray is getting more and more exercises in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that protests of the US and other Western allies bring into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used to Ethiopia as the basis for Dr@@ on@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even when they recently divided it to this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies in a already vol@@ at@@ il@@ ous area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; Sar@@ kas@@ mus .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday repe@@ ating his campaign by re@@ alizing that his multiple repeated statement , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder of the Islamic State .
this clar@@ if@@ ying new questions about the communication skills of the Presi@@ dents rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans to whether he is able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings up his collabor@@ ators who try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to be explained to the peculi@@ ar position of declar@@ ing that he could not have .
having made the hint at a election event held on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump done in regards to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to imp@@ lied that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cast@@ ically .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation totally seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to we@@ aken the statement something weak@@ ened by doing it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the Republi@@ can President will not know about it .
the final storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t to Mr. Tr@@ ump as he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to dec@@ aying envel@@ opes to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this issue again .
mist@@ aken on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ton proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he did not find their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already taken sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
at the end of July he preferred strong criticism of himself when he said , the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack at Mrs. Clin@@ tons E@@ emails , but later I said &quot; Nat@@ ar@@ lich I mean the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the boundaries of the boundaries in politics and then move back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages can be absorbed by his fans , as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; clear &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert , who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ age enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of ent@@ ru@@ sted the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even estimated sound , as his cont@@ empor@@ aries have continued to go back .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was released on Friday showed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ olog@@ ise himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he frequently asked his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or fal@@ si@@ fy their humor .
but while he stands in focus of attention in the past few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ y Scher@@ ze had brought his loyal co @-@ oper@@ as into the uncomfortable situation brought to him , irrespective of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he said Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton to the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her but@@ cher , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he depart@@ ed the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , held in Mrs. Clinton as a Foreign Minister , ISIS may have allowed to spread it to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to ride on each of his words and taken him bi@@ ased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he for@@ giving the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television professionals who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You Can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats conf@@ uses Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s accus@@ ation as only one proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed over the price from the market , café comes back in Green@@ point
the cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by cafe in William@@ sburg , where you can pay only bar , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years in good coffee .
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been displ@@ aced .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
native people caught it as a last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ feature wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and is now a so@@ ap @-@ business now . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ alized s@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cis@@ co Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he began to work in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els , the same es@@ pres@@ se model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verse .
but Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are yar@@ ni@@ ers such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural hin@@ ders .
the café serves no beer more , therefore there are fresh juice .
after nine months Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he has noticed a steady stream of old stem .
&quot; many old customers have also been forced by prices of William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca was a similar customer .
Oliveira , 34 , lived earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the cal@@ f had closed , she gave a while the coffee left , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that liked me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drank tea again , even if she asked a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea at a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and faithful customer since the beginning of the end of 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always the same thing .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes it switches to Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he did not think any Gro@@ ll that the so@@ ap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , offered a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ br@@ üh@@ ling coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go back to her offer , &quot; said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into the Polish and Rod@@ rigu@@ ez said that he has imagined to put them back soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ room would like to fill and sell the cool@@ ed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café has been expanded to a nearby building .
for many customers a new cal@@ f is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was regular and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the ath@@ om@@ iting of the location and the beast got a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to cra@@ wl , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gour@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a pen@@ um@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fif@@ th Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tles .
his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ au@@ men@@ ch@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with light people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
Co@@ es Last Book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the Food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ por@@ ters in the Ic@@ ici &apos; sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , straightforward I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the IP@@ O in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , be@@ presented a virgin cheese with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato and vegetables .
as the Rep@@ orter Hack@@ br@@ aten , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .

there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ anese and Be@@ nen@@ bro@@ t .

Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have laid in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years ahead of the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women bo@@ iled for male field workers and it was fresh@@ ly designed past@@ ry for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were the Americans who sent from the first World War to star@@ ry Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square die &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country went to be no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a key , sharp issue was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talented co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as keen was the new bud@@ ding so@@ dium : mysterious food such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ans were recovered to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ um as &quot; wonderful type , Es@@ sens@@ ing , &quot; mer@@ ged Zi@@ egel@@ man , because ch@@ efs un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients were hidden under a cre@@ amy sau@@ ce .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular supplement on lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in a almost wast@@ ed dining room and carried a sm@@ king .
he was wonderful real stran@@ gen@@ ess .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt could possibly have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had promp@@ ted him to static to his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the stri@@ ving of a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that the White House produced the bo@@ red meal in Washington but also one of the most con@@ du@@ ly prepared . &quot;

the leg@@ acies is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple had been better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not cast food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; she made people really sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , hum@@ ble recipes to send a fancy name . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed Om@@ ar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ed everything to save the life of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died by a fa@@ it @-@ attack by the Assad regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White helmet , &quot; a civil group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung previously saved lives of almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people out of bom@@ ach@@ ed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil service that shows him on a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the shining symbol@@ ism of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he has never seen itself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am dying to save lives , I think God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Om@@ ar fell victim to himself , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .

he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a well a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only 150 years of offspring .
super@@ fic@@ ally flo@@ wn at the bottom of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic at an hour , it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 feet .
only if it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a ro@@ be .
this von Lang@@ lon@@ eliness does not seem to be a patent for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science &quot; at any rate from Green@@ land@@ ai , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from Max @-@ Plan@@ ck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which for sp@@ ans means a world record .
though , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist was already long that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are stone @-@ old .
just failed the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly popul@@ ated co@@ asts of Canada , Green@@ land , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they dive on the surface mostly only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie researchers do not know accordingly .
your time @-@ pent@@ o corn moder@@ ation them , when they set up six animals with a transm@@ itter .
lo@@ ot does this Ha@@ ie nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly chase them sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol in the bottom of the Ic@@ ef@@ eres and are looking for Kad@@ aver , who are tor@@ ches out of higher water layers .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Green@@ land or S@@ val@@ bard from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the lin@@ sen@@ core of shar@@ ks .
this center of the ey@@ epi@@ ano is already created before the birth of the Ha@@ ie , the proteins are later no longer re@@ done .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a great deal of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ens .
your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon @-@ attempt large quantities of this radi@@ o@@ active carbon in the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centi@@ meters in length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ ens attempt to try a low over@@ shot of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic structure , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 .
all larger Grön@@ land had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which is created by cosmic ray in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meters long Green@@ land hai an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters can be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ land @-@ females only then get off when they are longer than four meters .
the researchers of the length could as@@ sign a age .
since one of the animals reached with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters , probably at the thres@@ hold to the sex ri@@ pe and his age was determined with 156 years , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ e was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
even this is likely to be a world record for sp@@ ins .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record label , a 211 year old Green@@ land w@@ al , in whose sp@@ eck at the N@@ aked a 120 year old har@@ p @-@ pointed @-@ pointed , was captured before Alaska .
due to low temperatures also , the organism that live there are animals on spar@@ fl@@ amme .
so they mature - and al@@ tern s@@ lower .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal temper@@ ate heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on getting as early as possible as possible as possible as possible . &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
a very big animal should use its resources rather in a long life .
Baumeister &apos;s underground in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with themes around the building , the municipal council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a relief , the committee also took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the younger dormit@@ ory places can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ ing and final questions were clar@@ ified and the requests for measurement has been placed , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( range 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the ways . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the council is convinced that the streams in rural and calm residential community Schön@@ au offers young families and ge@@ ars sen@@ iors alike .
as it says , construction permits now can report now in the Rathaus , on the award of the par@@ cel , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session .
in order to include further commercial transactions , related to the creation of jobs , to be consul@@ ted , decided to change the parish , which will only change in the spring of this year newly created fl@@ ake plan in sub @-@ areas .
thus , in the field of sub@@ time lar@@ ry , the industrial area has already been expanded there by two plots in direction of the State Road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City am Main started in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best chances of attrac@@ ting London attrac@@ ting jobs and firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt profits most from Bre@@ xit @-@ vote &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of Kompet@@ enz@@ fel@@ ds financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain , whether the banks are continuing to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval was not sufficient for them in the UK .
this is the use of major US banks .
several banks have already announced , to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lob@@ by@@ vereinigung &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; counts with 10,000 new jobs on the Main bin@@ nen 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , speaking the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility of monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities as the European insurance supervision of EI@@ O@@ PA and the ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Luxembourg , a large fund industry , cutting but as well as Dublin is worse in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
furthermore , points of the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the h@@ iring for first @-@ class commercial properties were 50 percent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition with good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city at position seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin at position 33 and Paris at 37 . place .
even if the quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial hub for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could tigh@@ ten further banks and investors &quot; as follows the I@@ W .
but London will remain in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
for that also the power relations : in London worked according to numbers from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from h@@ epatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ an@@ ite with Mer@@ ck
a US secret@@ ary decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the legal costs , which have emerged from the h@@ epat@@ its C legal dispute with the Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was fre@@ ed from a claim of $ 200 million for the injury of two patents from Mer@@ ck , related to the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medication S@@ ov@@ aldi and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct of Mer@@ cks , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ic acts .
in the collection of the law@@ suit , on Thursday , U.S. inaugur@@ ation said on Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to pl@@ ain@@ let the cost which were created during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to compare Gilead to the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , as Gilead , and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endants and property on laboratory work , to which So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vir for@@ ged , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax declaration in 2015 , revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ cript of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton concluded an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her office in the Department of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s can@@ did@@ at for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax exemp@@ tions for the last ten years .
they paid an effective Bundes@@ contrac@@ tor of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; were Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a stark contrast to the Donald Tr@@ ump hiding behind false exc@@ uses and pul@@ ler with regard to its previous promises to publish its tax exemp@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax exemp@@ tions although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York busin@@ essm@@ an , and his lawyers have given as the reason for his obj@@ ection to enter a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton electoral campaigns at Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with respect to the release of the President of Presi@@ dents in the Democratic Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special advis@@ er to CN@@ N that he would not permit to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not complete .
tr@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can President of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already promised that his ref@@ us@@ al issues regarding assets , his donations to charitable organisations , his business seminars and various other associations , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed up on the subject and released a video on the internet in the high @-@ level rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech at the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential campaign has been done in recent decades and its tax exemp@@ tions to publish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump has been paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times reported on Friday a number of tax ev@@ asion and tax advis@@ ors , the information that this could still be the case .
government control are now on a subject in an election campaign .
Clinton supports a provision that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ers who would make sure that people earn more than $ 1 million a tax pay@@ load of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal also .
during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ alo , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial group gl@@ omer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax exemp@@ tions .

natural environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania are using an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from hab@@ itu@@ al settlements - they throw cond@@ oms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation which had already intensi@@ vely intensified the idea along with the American nature conservation , by doing volunteers in villages in Northern Tanz@@ an@@ as , to use a non@@ violent quad@@ rup@@ ture method to protect their houses and harvest without destro@@ ying animals .
previously , many sp@@ ies have used to defend oneself .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit we could observe within this commun@@ e a change of their attitude , whereby they can hold much more confidence that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields , without the eleph@@ ants to hurt the eleph@@ ants Dam@@ ian Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps embr@@ aced the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bli@@ sters into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not de@@ ported , a so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a touch is usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
one final possibility is a l@@ ur@@ fer , which sho@@ ots a lab@@ ur@@ ist fire@@ works in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish Regisse@@ ur zer@@ beats Berliner Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ selection has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ased a media release after it had betra@@ yed that any Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has failed to list in Berlin because the arab@@ ic guests had requested according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Trial &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how about 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol has a way to choose Israel on its own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel told that the measure would be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision taken by the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it stood , ext@@ ingu@@ ish in the film@@ maker even more w@@ ut out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas @-@ commerce called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; tells the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were ent@@ ru@@ ded and troub@@ led by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this in Germany has led to this hotel chain is even a greater shame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this needs no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident emerged a fairly large reson@@ ance on the internet in which people called for a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subjected the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have given the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alle@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sham@@ eful you , &quot; was it in another article where it was noted that the hotel is located at the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synago@@ gue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dism@@ issed all alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not enter into the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of any Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT business
according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian amb@@ assador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the Trade Agreement between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an in the year comparison by 7@@ 0,9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in shops in the country , distributed the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors to the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
Russian companies take existing links with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , the further trade @-@ building is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he mer@@ ged that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0,9 percent compared with the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million amo@@ unted to .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 per cent spr@@ inkl@@ ing and bet@@ s $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial down@@ turn was reached by delivery of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian Auslands@@ ImmobilienPortal.com gave about 35,@@ 000 VIS@@ AS , first and foremost Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran reached the Top 20 countries , affecting the tourist number in Russia .
one could say that the record of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rush to home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the V@@ od@@ ine Sprint in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the stimulation of his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself up . the j@@ ection and made the legend pro@@ ud@@ ly , when he went home to a victory of the New Zealand New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y took the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad old@@ tim@@ ed medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March by the train @-@ World Championships in London despite the back section Ho@@ ys only one modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the B@@ aker Jamie &apos;s staff .
they did this time in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement reti@@ red a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton wanted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the first four years ago with Ho@@ y Vic@@ t@@ orious - and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fication rounds a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the flo@@ cks wins the New Zeal@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des was just under back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and the inner held it .
a Strateg@@ ic change made a great part of the transformation , in which hin@@ der was driving in a higher gear to slow him and to allow Kenn@@ y and primarily Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell sw@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climb@@ ed up against the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; It is a fl@@ atter@@ y comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys gave guidance to that he was moving after a weak start off on the rail@@ ways .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England ri@@ vals .
there was no such problem in such a over@@ rag@@ ing victory this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , which were obtained from 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ me .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the scope of possible that it is repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
this would be born for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y ( a apparently hom@@ est@@ ed date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a swing of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
the du@@ ms of Ho@@ y equ@@ als .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint you start and go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ du said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ ley of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Br@@ adly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the world record , which won in London gold lay at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22 / 42 ) will be held on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins .
he was argu@@ ed yesterday with evidence of the qualification as it proved to be function@@ aries to measure his height .
in the sac@@ ral &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anci@@ ed Laura Tr@@ ott , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archives of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world time period in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team is leaving for his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pe@@ ar on medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were dropped .
they played drama in the background , so the re@@ sig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ pen@@ ers as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
but if one sees itself the first evening of competition in Vel@@ od@@ me , it looks quite then that the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment .
future of the mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy age frag@@ ile
the future of alumin@@ um mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake because the plant operators termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and therefore raise all of the supply contracts , as the supplied energy business .
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a pay@@ out for 20 years is scheduled in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs and indirectly - could be endangered in a closure .
in addition , it might come to domin@@ oplast@@ y effects since the mel@@ ting of approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation int@@ as consum@@ es .
2014 closed Al@@ coa , Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last because of the power price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies large alumin@@ um mel@@ t@@ ling with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in a multi @-@ operation ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects that the plant continues to be operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by mel@@ ting , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continue to say that the Tre@@ aties of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will have to come into force starting November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L goes out that the contracts of the financial year will contribute to the revenues in the financial year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all potential impact on the AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong F@@ airs for wholes@@ ale prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared that there have already written the value of the Tre@@ aties in the amount of $ 187 million in an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ter@@ mination of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the treaties , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability Alco@@ hol ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate or to ensure the power @-@ power to the mel@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that there was a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have been in force from November this year , even if it is still a statement , why it is rec@@ eded by the contract .
as a result of the bad economic relations of the industry before the possible closing of the port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land require around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts at electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , that would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an electricity producer it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kendall is at the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall J@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ ress and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cri@@ bes of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and was running on the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people that I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to wines , &quot; he wrote .
the unveil@@ ing of Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , p@@ onder@@ pt@@ etes Re@@ ality and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , how they forget the cover of their sister and ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party .
this presents the kl@@ ine action nearly every Bir@@ th@@ day plane of a children &apos;s shipment ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition that we would have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let off her other girls to take part in the publicity .
with a view of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue , has certainly started a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes them as regards the Vo@@ gue Cover , they have defeated ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were shown on April 2014 ) but the cover of the sept@@ ember@@ ment is a League for itself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ ment is for Vo@@ gue the most pres@@ cri@@ bing issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , that resem@@ bles a cap@@ band as a fashion label , the output brings a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut ) . ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his Cover@@ stars is fores@@ een so long that in the last two years the magazine has been w@@ oven in front of the official announcement .
women who were already at the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mod@@ els , celebr@@ ities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand amb@@ assador of Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 at the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the small probability that Mrs J@@ ator - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under former category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or Re@@ ality Stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if all of it speci@@ fies into the denomin@@ ator ) .
you are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
once appeared on the last cover , had appeared with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade of one of the most successful years of their career .
naturally Jenn@@ ers like success not everyone .
with its Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ history Jenn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ ar and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called her &quot; the mist@@ r@@ ities of the moment . &quot;
these feelings come back much , when the message with the appearance Jenn@@ ers came out at the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the distr@@ action it seems to pass on the point passing .
Kendall J@@ ump is on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her paintings by Cindy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is on the Re@@ ality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community @-@ centers indicate a year 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid figures of the country are being rejected annually by the community centers , while the industry set on the effects of other mid@@ del@@ ights on already covering transactions .
in Queensland , three of five people are already being three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unt@@ it@@ ational not@@ ations and similar arrangements - at their request for free legal advice and legal advis@@ ing .
legal services of the municipality , which are already excessive extensively and are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , this legal centers will lose further 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the municipality of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Common Market centres revealed that thousands of people are referred to each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation should only be worse without the abolition of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ onian rec@@ itals centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected . &quot; he said .
people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and vigor@@ ous debts , families who were dism@@ issed through separ@@ ations - all these people have trouble with legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need .
the federal government will be ab@@ brevi@@ ated by 30 percent since June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid people from Queensland are forced to be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we are calling for the General Ac@@ quisition and Federal Foreign Minister and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to up@@ lift these mid@@ ab@@ brevi@@ ations , so that people can get the help they need in legal problems .
last year , the federal government met its commitment , to lift funds for guidance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work .

while the red @-@ black government of government in North America could decline slightly further , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have good chances to continue the Prime Minister .

Nokia 6@@ 126 USB Phone : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communicator USB Modem market .
the success@@ ors domin@@ ate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device did almost half a k@@ ilo@@ grams and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty klo@@ k .
the built @-@ in store was at the beginning of eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would range today for about two persons with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 Gig@@ abyte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 &quot; was created exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros enthusiasts can buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow removed from the middle age of the dormit@@ ory .
however 20 years ago the Communicator has been a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months previously on the Computer@@ messe C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was un@@ answered .
even access to websites was possible using HTML browsers , if also tor@@ ment@@ ing slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital ad@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enna and the mobile phone could be opened much like a laptop .
then you found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany lay in 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to see in August 1996 , that the Communicator will become the beginning of the Smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ card of the fin@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and settled .
the market domin@@ ate the market today that came all a lot later than Nokia .
always be online and everywhere online , this is today for a very many human everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold about 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , of it alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
the global sales of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
to this end , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunic@@ ations concerts are coming to this end .
around the smartphone , a whole industry has now been developed .
the decisive breakthrough for the mass market was just beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs announced on the Mac OS &apos;s launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he adds three devices in one : a single player , a telephone and an internet communication , all via touch screen easy to use .
the winner of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the after@@ math .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sag@@ ging now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is for 20 years following his invention a matter of course .
the in@@ cis@@ ion today every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to commit the smartphone again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ ina &apos;s Ball , in the Siemens Board of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent const@@ ancy is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only be born in our local communities and in London , but throughout the country , renewal and prosperity .
for me , it represented the greatest At@@ traction He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we put a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will be alone 10,000 new appr@@ enti@@ ces , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment will end up .
as they were ahead in London in 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will be wrong at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion on wit@@ ted growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the UK and throughout the UK .
we have established a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure investments in time and budget , from the T5 - the five year as a result of the world @-@ best airport enter@@ minal was built up to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for Britain and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we ste@@ er this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as assure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the UK .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ l@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad @-@ block
for companies who earn money with On@@ line@@ age money come according to one of the software developers attempts to deal with ad @-@ block , a &quot; cat@@ chy and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad flo@@ ating on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus also published a blo@@ gger , in which it proves that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that his desktop site would change the en@@ coding on his advertis@@ ements to show it &apos;s indic@@ ating the detection about what part of the page advertising is to make difficult .
but Ad@@ block declar@@ es that there was a new way of dealing with new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ und @-@ H@@ er &apos;s battle between the presented Open Source Community and the transform@@ ers have already been underway since the invention of ad flo@@ wering . &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world @-@ largest company has lo@@ wer@@ ed in the fight is a strong indi@@ ces for how wor@@ rying ad @-@ looking for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people re@@ plac@@ eable ; almost four times as much 2013 .
having upgraded billions every day active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices makes hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung is 84 per cent of the advertising video ebooks .
the company has it based on ad block instruc@@ ting on desktop PCs , since mobile ad st@@ ail@@ er does not have any effect on fac@@ ebook mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram account , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large percentage of revenue , so that Facebook appears the investment of such a p@@ ac@@ es as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to give people more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday he claimed that the blocks were wor@@ rying out new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block block are a stupid means , which is why we instead have concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control in the hands of the people .
wife in pres@@ su@@ icide self @-@ su@@ icide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls for witnesses after a woman was driving on a highway in the early hours on Thursday during an suspected mis@@ su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of Wa@@ al shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark , in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in the city .
it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 years , that has been run by several vehicles , including a truck , even killing themselves .
it died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , said the police , whom these and every witnesses in the incident are requested to report themselves .
it became an investig@@ ative process opened what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is , said Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter , the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers cannot be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran into the Dark on the highway - was decided that drivers do not assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night run on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ emen was acqu@@ itted free after having killed a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had been dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious on the road , took the court .
the court set that the police officer &apos; responded to a repe@@ al way -- on a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once a hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once committed to proj@@ ections for a new NAS@@ A climate model .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NAS@@ A developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ bles those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be exposed to its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ density atmosphere once er@@ d@@ ently conditions .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow restructuring of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and nonetheless slowly proce@@ eded .
the model also illumin@@ ate the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet pres@@ um@@ ably more dry areas than on earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to spread more quickly dar@@ ing .
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent mat@@ ters .
&quot; in the ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ ates the slow record of the Venus its conference side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick sli@@ ding clouds , what an umbrella acts to shield the surface of a large part of the sun war@@ ms .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree of cooler than the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that was previously thought of planetary research .
although it was once pres@@ um@@ ably hab@@ itable , the Venus -- over the course of several billions years and ul@@ tra@@ violet light was exposed .
their oceans dis@@ closed and its hydr@@ o was burned down from ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as your hydro@@ gen @-@ wich has only remained a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly serious effect - the Venus we know how we know it today .
the researchers stressed the results of their new Venus climate mod@@ ell@@ ells at Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy enters as a trainer of the Aval@@ ai@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations for the Colorado Aval@@ ai@@ ks and led to a little fellow @-@ decision @-@ making process in the team @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and expressed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as Chief Executive , and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ ai@@ ks with energy , passion and determination , &quot; out@@ go@@ ed the 50 year of Roy in an opinion .
I &apos;ve been thinking about the summer for a long time and much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it requires and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey must be perfectly suited to the organization &apos;s organization .
he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , which was mist@@ aken by Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thanks him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was recognized during his debut season at the Aval@@ ai@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the League .
he led the association on 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed the summer season in each of the last few years .
the Aval@@ ai@@ ds were recorded in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference to return five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ oe and the Aval@@ ai@@ ks .
Nor@@ dis@@ ee@@ pers will resume talks again , strike a strike from
the labour @-@ struggles regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North se@@ wage workers are exposed , while all the dispute will put in the table for a new conversation of discussion , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil area @-@ service providers Wood Group were performed spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ites and the trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to begin the resolution &apos; process of the current dispute &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will keep some day @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , the beginning of next year will start to tackle the problems .
the unions have said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years to be a protest against possible wage short@@ cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group introduced the branch to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the consolidation of the company follows a 10 @-@ owned decline in on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dism@@ issed his part of thousands of people and announced plans to en@@ force his oil and business activities in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ um@@ eration with the British Energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are based on lower income prices under pressure , an economic situation that had intensified due to the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish parliament@@ arians Dave Anderson met in the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the largest employment issues , held from a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy which works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion is expected to spend new projects in the North Sea as compared to an average about $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star@@ ry christ@@ en@@ ings of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the full catalogue of rot@@ ations@@ rates under the stars of the star@@ ring p@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star clu@@ sters to different vines and in what connection are the rotation periods with the planetary development .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ p@@ ile of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star clu@@ sters that have emerged about 125 million years ago , reaching the adul@@ th@@ ood .
at the fastest time you are turning to the fastest .
to top rot@@ ation@@ ary rates encounter these wr@@ aps stars large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation now begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each con@@ stellation , by creating the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star@@ ch -- like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue from Rot@@ ation rates indicates that massive stars revol@@ ve more than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , having bigger star s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in B@@ allet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pl@@ allet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas swi@@ ping rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star @-@ p@@ ile of the Pl@@ ates is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ation rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of Ple@@ j@@ ades provides an an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much more to us about what we want to know more about how , When , W@@ ann and Why stars slow their rotation rates and so called their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three records in detail about their latest analysis of the rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star appears
the tears slept with Alex Rod@@ rigu@@ ez faster than the US Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in best days of base to base .
after his emotional review announcement , the 41 year old professional sat down on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays the last time the Tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ star all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rod@@ rigu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year @-@ year contract agreed that 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the cont@@ ours on 31 December 2017 , he acts in future as a consultant and youth coach - in full sal@@ ary .
as player paid it Rod@@ rigu@@ ez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 31@@ 14 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays just show two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
however , in the silence of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old does not likely to be absorbed .
because so successful Rod@@ rigu@@ ez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was , it is disp@@ uted his appearance outside of the square .
as early as 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was to be captured from 2001 to 2003 ban ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was blocked because of an age in the so called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rod@@ rigu@@ ez is regarded as main di@@ m@@ ative , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I played a break for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rod@@ rigu@@ ez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ are@@ well @-@ days did not go un@@ le@@ ep .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games are once again received the big stage , Rod@@ rigu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; valued Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all Rod@@ rigu@@ ez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate , Hudson , the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ aic Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ op@@ ing@@ accidents
get caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ test , weigh@@ ting Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
an experienced ath@@ l@@ ete would have gained almost a med@@ al .
in front of the seventh competition the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ es have become the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ barriers to Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish weigh@@ ting Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - just before the start of the already crit@@ ically affected athle@@ tics competitions occur this news on the un@@ time .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tik@@ um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as mas@@ k@@ able means for d@@ op@@ ing@@ fabric .
the International Sport@@ court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze .
in Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the prec@@ ep@@ ts of 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing submitted for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation in investigations , &quot; cited Li@@ fel@@ ong from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ court CAS and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot;
for the first time in history is not the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes , with positive cases .
also at night of Rio sick@@ ened the message over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa through , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four@@ teen test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is intended to act in the bot@@ tom@@ ed substance around the blood @-@ op@@ ing@@ medium EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was pro@@ visional guarantee , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ iko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w welcomes you immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ ali@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not take the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are under review , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , about all the weights from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ load nation not in Rio are allowed to participate .
on Friday also the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was announced , the London &apos;s Olympi@@ asi@@ eger in the class up to 85 kg was tested as positive as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive to the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
both climb@@ ed the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World association IAAF had the complete Russian team up to an exception for systematic dating back to the start of a systematic dating back in Rio , also produces a lot of bad news in Rio .
in the water @-@ sport they also had the earlier expos@@ ures in China for fier@@ ce disputes between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t den Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of open style , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio .
sun was also the centre of a discussion with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested at the Chinese champion@@ ships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Daten@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses du ran@@ som
programmer from Ex@@ press@@ ors @-@ Mal@@ ware currently have targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a current survey of Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies have been at least once , partially repeatedly victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a re@@ ans@@ om@@ ware comp@@ res@@ by .
40 percent of the victims made ready by the bag requested by the perpet@@ rators of using the systems and data submitted .
the perpet@@ rators do their re@@ pres@@ so software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attack on attacks in corporate networks .
are they successful there , the potential for comp@@ elling ran@@ som will be much higher than with private user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then , the perpet@@ rator black@@ mailing software for itself .
only private users had the goal , but the change to company W@@ acken took place in the past months quickly .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works for a simple sample : once on the computer of a victim , it looks for a long changed file like Word@@ search , Ex@@ cel@@ or or database files as well as on archives of images and videos .
these files en@@ coded the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software presents the requirements of the comp@@ resses .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files you need to transfer the victim money - mostly in the form of cr@@ acks in Bit@@ coin .
but where to play a personal photo @-@ database on the game , it goes to companies to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage is falling when a ra@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is propos@@ ing .
22 percent of the companies affected by the companies affected by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely break the business , in any case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany already several hospitals were victims of attack , whose patients could be threatened by the loss of sick@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say to the victims always , you are not paying for the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in operation in the face of breast@@ feeding .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure has investigated user @-@ surfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to take more money .
they tell their sacrific@@ es by chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and we will rede@@ em individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies must pay partly hard and pay five @-@ dig@@ it sums in order to reg@@ ain their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the h@@ ans@@ om@@ ware comp@@ res@@ in , the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explains security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus providers of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a co@@ ans@@ om@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that there are three or four people .
the programmers sell their poll@@ uting software then in the form of a software building on the actual appearance .
the previously developed mal@@ ware kit , created by the mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed cost between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in the scope is a adapt@@ ability , such that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ch@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ chem@@ ser are then looking for another h@@ acker to dissemin@@ ate the fresh@@ ly selling software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one log@@ ically log@@ ged in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a crime and in@@ stru@@ ed another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per incre@@ mental calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als bear the crime with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
in the meantime , the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies who can better secure their data .
over 50 per cent of the firms in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware can rely on file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful re@@ ess@@ ation , the offen@@ ders instead do with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage , depending on the type of data the damage is even more than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could use completely new goals on the internet of things on the cor@@ n .
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con illustrated safety researchers how they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control over the internet .
in the middle of winter the activ@@ eness of such a block @-@ block heating of such man@@ power might be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then instead of the heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware could also become a topic in the Industry 4.0 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just a trunk area of 453 l and 10@@ 26 l rests with the back@@ cord , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the back@@ yard can be high @-@ coat , and therefore offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m .
the trunk space is well exposed , however , the load @-@ height is higher than 650 mm slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .

better transport flow on the highway br@@ inger
on a regular basis , it looks on a regular basis - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right ab@@ rup@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all motor@@ ists , who are in traffic on the environ@@ ment@@ strasse each evening in St@@ au , when they go over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state construction of road building extends to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer street and the exit of Wes@@ eler Street at 700 meters .
motor@@ ists can then pass straight from the Hammer street on the right .
the major advantage : the traffic will be raised early on , whereby the overall connection has been improved in the multip@@ lier section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U fac@@ tion in the district of Münster @-@ West in the district of Münster @-@ West .
driving on the Zu@@ br@@ inger runs mainly between 17 and 19 hours .
week@@ days reaches the back@@ st@@ au to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the adel@@ öh@@ r on the B 51 shortly before the exit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wes@@ ley Street &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from here the traffic will be drawn only one @-@ lane over the highway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed a three @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations made that the bridge no longer has the necessary capacity to absor@@ b in particular the heavy @-@ heavy traffic .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the related path@@ way will last , the constant state of state can not say .
however , with years to reck@@ on : because the bridge has an official Rest@@ ric@@ ate duration until the year 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal consultation , the country is aware of the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of star@@ ry : hope of weather
the weather has made the star@@ red sho@@ cks in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night for Friday one way through the invoice - but there is even hope .
the night was not suited for clouds and rain , the Himm@@ els@@ spectac@@ le to watch , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night on Saturday .
the weather is to be good , then we certainly see many star@@ ry trees in the sky .
the ast@@ er@@ d@@ olls are Pers@@ ec@@ den who belong to the quick@@ est star @-@ type with 216@@ 000 kilometres per hour .
they will have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sle@@ e@@ pers
in the evening , one stands forever , while in the evening it is un@@ parall@@ eled , in the morning it is still far ahead of the wake @-@ up of sleep , no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one has problems with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institut has about a quarter of adult sleep and more than ten percent of their sleep often or permanently reco@@ vering .
how do sleeping troubles or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders and there are multiple causes of underlying causes , Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , director of the German Society for Schlaf@@ Research and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands inev@@ it@@ ably , but the ins@@ om@@ nia is , therefore an input and as@@ le@@ as@@ le@@ ep .
straight the as@@ le@@ ep most people feel as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , director manager at the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or contamin@@ ated factors , but also drugs are stuck .
not rare is the sleep expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early in the wake is often during a depression , &quot; says We@@ ab@@ ia .
and it can be that various factors want to face another .
who@@ ever has a sli@@ ce incident , can lie bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and do@@ si@@ bly cr@@ iti@@ vely , on all day @-@ to @-@ day problems and worry , there is one example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one go to your doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who are not as@@ le@@ ep over a period of a month at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , should go to the doctor , coun@@ cils .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look very differently : one is ab@@ be@@ aten but tired , un@@ sign@@ posted , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood or physical complaints such as gast@@ ric or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep inter@@ rup@@ ting , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , among other things are behavi@@ our@@ al patterns , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic bed@@ linen , only in the case of use and at most for two weeks .
Dutch medical pract@@ itioner does not exist in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary medical center at the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleep , one should first turn to the veter@@ in@@ arian , coun@@ cils .
the can be clar@@ ified with studies , whether problems have a physical cause .
who should go into the laboratory and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining in the laboratory of medical laboratory physicians , for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory diseases , in sick@@ nesses or if you cannot find the cause of a le@@ as@@ le@@ ep disorder , Fi@@ em@@ asons .
it is not necessary to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make a mid@@ day sheep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the c@@ row , one goes to his normal time into the bed .
beside the electro@@ des in the body you are carrying a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ ae on the finger .
it also features a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can suffer@@ ers get the problems into the handle ?
there are quite a lot of adjust@@ ing screws on which one can put on a better sleep .
We@@ aver counts on : regular sleeping and resi@@ des , not too long in bed , do not sleep away at night sleeping , alcohol , and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and certainly not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with lack of medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has vo@@ iced on Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he was caught up in Doha at the short @-@ ground world Championships in Doha in the first time and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has provided his work @-@ team members via Facebook in front of his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ winner receives 20,000 € Pre@@ mia and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised about lack of medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his fac@@ ebook page .
the convey@@ or system in the swimming sport is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in contrast very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not work closely with the subject d@@ oping down or run it even .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that here the controls are set to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had already been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly what you should do with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled at a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent control of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the election of Hamburger , who is now running a Eis@@ di@@ ele . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de von Bag to be arrested
professional di@@ ebe at Düsseldorf Airport
civil forces of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police were able to manage two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years on Thursday .
the pa@@ ver had committed as a ban@@ de for several handker@@ chi@@ ds and luggage carrier .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials realized a gang in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a gang that was known for the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ik@@ te since mid July this year and were mainly professional , working @-@ place and especially professional .
the experts of the crime comm@@ iss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can send the thi@@ eves ; the stran@@ ds submitted to Germany entered into Germany , four acts of action .
they had a total of more than 15,@@ 000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Alt@@ bauten , a few lin@@ den@@ oun@@ mp@@ s , meanwhile , even a rest of the head @-@ stones : the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain , at first sight does not work so , but the police ranks it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one passes the road from east to west , one gets to playground , a fresh@@ ly kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
on the facade of a gray house someone has ugly !
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : up to 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
article about this &quot; tr@@ en@@ rich city , &quot; as the zu@@ constant property company called Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain , are to be preferred in recent weeks with burning cars .
the ground is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied by now , the residents have rented apartments , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , H@@ enkel has been repeatedly declared for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
once on June 22nd , the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , made with 300 police officials , according to 300 police officers , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on the ground , block parts of the street and kept visitors from going to the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , the renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin administration decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later moved police and construction workers under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents are walking with children , and people sit on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained at vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a found@@ ational school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left force is not the main avenue of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , which are three children here , are mainly generated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about rising Mi@@ ets and cent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound by an Kie@@ z that is a majority of pol@@ ym@@ es before v@@ and@@ al@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin conductor and the police between the land@@ owners and their neighbours , exists so obviously not .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also in comparison to the rest of the city has a lower average income and has high poverty risk .
also home occup@@ ations and the resulting living projects are long since the region : 1990 , numerous homes were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Street , close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ zer has been vac@@ ill@@ ated under a large police station , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ net for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : with them native inhabitants of the G@@ DR @-@ Time and former home@@ owners .
this is also noticeable in the rental , which has grown by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on con@@ figured sli@@ ces or fresh rep@@ ain@@ ted fac@@ ades , which were subjected to colour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours are considered to be a problem , it might not necessarily be affected by crime , crimes , such as bodily injury , statistics reveal that almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the off@@ ences make the damage , the ten@@ ant rather the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses meet .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who for 17 years in a hi@@ ber@@ house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is most important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , those were not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer any longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary , &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse - and remained .
for this reason , it was also so important that the inhabitants get their road back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the clear@@ ness about the district .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by secured new@@ buildings in former buildings , who supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately cond@@ omin@@ ium that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you do if there never stops someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides fru@@ stration , also with the police and the occup@@ ants .
for those who like to have red @-@ bom@@ bs , Kerstin has little Neu@@ geb@@ auer little understanding : the house projects and the le@@ ft@@ ist scene belonged to the region .
who goes down , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain about noise .
all persons only provided with first names are asked , not to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
furthermore , she is a social worker on site .
since July Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ics team supports the team of management around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as contact for all players : refugees , working and refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else would be mist@@ aken .
Reg@@ ine Client from the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is here , the ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , who has above all a problem .
so some - less hur@@ ting as rather on the variety of challenges they wish - meant that administration wanted to write the place .
sear@@ ched for was a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , associated with many years of experience in the field of social work , just a superior Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , means Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network value .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point on three years fixed .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client , that Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ ours and main actors support .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers can be found at Was@@ en@@ straße
a severe problem has been to find apartments for some time , apartments for the junction who have been recognized .
in charge of the connection , the municipalities are responsible .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the cost of building , the rent or the renovation of these properties need to carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the trade office on the municipalities and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search had been designed to be very difficult for a while .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
so far you don &apos;t have to rely on private apartments , so dress .
therefore , the apartments must be exposed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are placed in the washing way .
but only with apartments is not done .
perspective is the keywords , are Reg@@ ine Client and Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le unified .
in addition to a steady lead , there are pract@@ ition@@ ers , training places , training courses , One @-@ Euro jobs and pay@@ out activities for refugees and migrants that have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Client .
many work in the building or help domestic @-@ power , carry @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat how Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community has led to a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in employment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day provides a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a depen@@ dency .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so , also here administration and hon@@ or@@ ary @-@ hon@@ or@@ ary .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the trial is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to declare to the refugees that it is just taking it and they can be sensible at the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who will eventually develop the feeling he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the substantial majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but problem inci@@ dents there are also , says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , where nothing is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent occurrence of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher can call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a resi@@ dual risk could not be ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sens@@ it@@ ised the hel@@ pers were already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to refugees .
they had the fear that the attacks put them entirely in release .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and hon@@ or@@ ary needs to hold out in the region and in the region according to activities .
they always keep in the background that soon a new b@@ ang would come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
this question is clear to answer , we scru@@ b politics .
actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine Client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher also worked out with it to properly integrate the past people .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need they can help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
